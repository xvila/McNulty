      "{u'31.Yaso Tangbao': [u'I had so much fun eating here with their \"fast food\" like service.  You order at the front and pick up your food and sit somewhere in the communal tables.  The pork dumplings were slightly different than soup dumplings I\\'ve had before.  Still pretty good and filling.  The chicken katsu was fried nicely.  The sweet and sour pork was pretty heavy and greasy.\\n\\nYou eat the soup dumplings with a paper soup spoon that was just the cutest thing I\\'ve seen.', u'Bomb dumplings, skins were a bit thick but still good.\\n\\nGo for the pork and crab, the soup is a lot more balanced than the pork only. \\n\\nThey only have one kind of greens listed but they were delicious. \\n\\nChili oil for $1 is not necessary as they have sriracha', u'I was craving Kao Fu so I made the trek to this spot instead of finding a place in Chinatown or Flushing.\\n\\nThe space is more takeout/fast dining where you order your food, pick it up and eat at their tables.  It was clean and roomier than a lot of Chinatown places.  The soup dumplings were good but like other reviews said, it only comes with 4.  The size might be a bit bigger than the ones you get in Chinatown but it was still a little pricier.\\n\\nIf I lived around the area, this would be a good spot to fix my Shanghai craving but coming from Williamsburg, I rather put in the extra effort to go to Chinatown.', u\"I love soup dumplings and these just didn't do it for me. I order one of each (pork, crab, spicy crab), sweet and sour pork ribs, and braised beef noodles. I was told there would be a 20 minute wait for soup dumplings, which was fine since it'll be fresh. After 35 minutes, we decided to ask them where our order was. It's a busy night, we get it. But I would have gotten my soup dumplings by now if I ate at a sit down restaurant. \\n\\nWe get the first half of our order which was the pork soup dumplings, the beef stew noodles, and the pork ribs. I was so disappointed when the soup dumplings weren't pipping hot, but at this point I was so hungry I didn't want to ask for another one. The pork dumplings were warm. I didn't even have to let it sit or blow on it. To make it worst, it lacked flavor. There wasn't enough flavor in the soup or meat. I let it go, hoping the others are better. Another 15 minutes later, we get the crab and chili one. The crab was probably the best choice out of the 3. It has the sweetness of crab, but still lack some flavor. The spicy pork one is a skip for me. All you taste is oil and it's not even spicy. You can't even taste the meat because the oil overpowers everything.\\n\\nThe braised beef noodles is also a skip. You can get better beef noodles for a cheaper price elsewhere. Not only that, what you get doesn't look like the picture. What you get looks more like the diced pork one. It got me confused for a second.\\n\\nThe best thing out of all would be the sweet and sour pork. This was the most flavorful thing we had. It's actually sweet and not really sour. The bones easily came off and it wasn't dry. I'm hesitant to even come back even though the rice dishes look kind of good.\", u\"No frills, but fast and delicious Shangainese food! Not an area I'm usually in, but glad I stumbled upon this place. They had the food ready in about 2 minutes and with decent prices and great flavor.\\n\\nYou pick up your order and self-seat which helps maintain the pace of the orders but there are plenty of seats and space to maneuver around in. \\n\\nThis is a place that is great to dine in at but also does a hearty carryout business as well. I'm looking forward to trying it again when across the street St Circa brewery or coming from an Alamo movie.\", u\"Pretty expensive for 4 shanghai dumplings but the size of it is pretty big and there's a lot of soup. The soup base inside the dumplings are not as fattening compared to other places in Chinatown. For this location, it's pretty good.\\n\\nI tried 3 different types of shanghai dumplings. Pork/ Crab & Pork/ Spicy Pork. Out of those 3, Pork is the best. Crab & Pork has this extra heavy taste to it whereas the spicy pork is really just soup base with hot sesame oil. When I drank the soup, it taste like I was just drinking pure oil. \\n\\nWait time for food is average. Even though this place is semi small, you can normally get seats within 5 mins of waiting. This place is kind of like food court style where you order and pay at the counter and then bring your food to the table, eat, then bounce.\", u'Ordered a pork bao. It had plenty of soup inside, and the skin was nicely pan fried. I will definitely come back for their soup dumpling and noodles.', u\"Yaso Tangbao was quite an interesting experience. It kind of reminded me of dimsum/yumcha but you order at the register first and they call you up when your food is ready. \\n\\nMy party was made of 6 people and we definitely over ordered! Lets see if I can remember everything we got. \\n\\nPork/ Crab & Pork / Spicy Pork Soup Dumplings: Okay... I personally thought the skin of the dumplings was too thick. It was hard to just bite into them to suck out the soup so it ended up spilling into my paper dish. \\n\\nVegetable Dumpling: Pretty flavorful but once again skin was too thick. \\n\\nCold Noodles (peanut sauce): Noodles were too thick and not al dente. There also wasn't enough sauce in my opinion. \\n\\nPork Meatball: Very flavorful, kinda fatty, and extremely greasy. \\n\\nSweet and Sour Ribs: Very good! The meat was seasoned very well. Highly recommend.\\n\\nSeasonal Garlic Fried Veggies: It was chinese broccoli for us. Very very garlicky and very very good! Definitely recommend. \\n\\nSweet Pumpkin Mochi w/ Coconut: Pretty good. Not a whole lot of pumpkin flavor if any. But the coconut was good. By the time I ate it it was cold so the mochi was pretty firm. \\n\\nChicken Curry Crispy Noodles: Chicken was very tender and well seasoned. Not a whole lot of curry flavor. Noodles were crispy tho. \\n\\nPanfried Pork Bao: My sister loved this but I thought it was a little too oily. \\n\\nOverall, pretty decent food. It's unique and is a good gateway to introduce traditional Chinese food to people who don't usually eat it. Service was quick though which is a plus.\\n\\nThere was plenty of seating (community tables). And it is self service so place your trays and steamers near the trash after you're done. Don't forget to pour yourself some soy sauce and vinegar for your dumplings.\", u\"During my first visit, I ordered the spicy pork soup dumplings and the vegetarian rice bowl. While the dumplings were good, my rice bowl was fairly cold (aside from the rice underneath), and the eggs seemed like they were sitting out for a while prior to my order and had gotten cold/hard. The prices were nice for the amount of food you receive, but unfortunately it just wasn't satisfactory this time.\", u\"This deserves more credit than what I gave it with my last review.  Since last a year, I've eaten a lot of dumplings and the soup dumplings (Y2 - crab and pork soup dumplings) were absolutely amazing. It is a casual place. Great option for lunch if you work in the hood. Yumminess!!!\", u'I do like the curry and it does taste like what we have back in Shanghai. The soup is also good. Fast service as well.', u\"OMG so good. I over-ordered because I was so excited to try everything. Soup dumplings were perfect. My fave was the pork and crab. Such a delicate flavor. And yes it was steaming hot but who cares   The spicy pork with oil- not a fan. A little too greasy. The bao was so different than I expected. The meat was savory but the pastry was sweet. No bad but takes some getting used to. I'll definitely be back\", u\"Walked by this place a few times and was curious, so I checked yelp.... good reviews and great pictures (thanks yelpers!) and of course, I went in. First impression... there is bench seating (sharing a bit of personal space) and it's hot inside (minimal ventilation). Should I stay? Why not!? \\n\\nI walked up to the cashier and asked a few questions about the\\xa0menu (which is conveniently posted on the left wall (with pictures!). I decided on a small order of rolls and buns, paid, and grabbed a seat (bench). I waited about 15 minutes because the buns are made per order. I got a little bored\\xa0and walked around a bit. There is a self serve station (soy sauce, venegar and sriracha), the hallway to the bathroom has cool artwork, they sell merch, and there is a glass window where you can watch them make the buns! These folks are skilled! As I was standing there mesmerized by the roll, swirl, pinch.... my order was called.\\xa0\\n\\nIt took more time than I expected, so\\xa0I ate the rolls there and took the buns to go.\\n\\nThe rolls were delicious! The exterior was crispy\\xa0but with a\\xa0firm bite and not too flaky. The inside\\xa0had a great balance of moist veggies and juicy meat. The\\xa0rolls tasted fresh and light even though they were deep fried! \\n\\nThe buns were very good. The flavors were subtle yet tasty. There was a good balance in the portions, and the meat was tender. However, I didn't care for the seeds on top and\\xa0I prefer the darker rolls that have a slight crisp on top that's ever so slightly sticky and sweet. But that is just preference.\\xa0These are different and they are very good.\\xa0\\n\\nBottom line... It's hot inside, there is a 15 to 20 min wait, consider making friends with your bench-mates.... but the staff is super friendly\\xa0and the food is really good. Worth the wait.\", u\"***3.5 stars***\\n\\nYaso Tangbao brings Shanghai street food to the heart of Brooklyn. You've platters of crawfish to munch on to your heart's content, freshly made Nianxing soup dumplings and pigs feet larger than your hand.\\n\\n/THE GOOD/\\nSoup dumplings:\\nYaso pork, blue crab pork, spicy pork. The skin is perfect: neither too thick nor too thin, not overly droopy. It's hard to choose a favorite between the blue crab pork and spicy pork.\\n\\nBraised pork meatballs:\\nIf you could eat clouds, I'd imagine this dish to be just that. It's the lightest, softest, jiggliest, and fluffiest balls of pork I've ever had. So good. \\n\\nSweet & sour pork spare ribs:\\nYummy, finger licking sauce that thickly coats the spare ribs. Perfect tartness & sweetness. \\n\\nSweet pumpkin cakes:\\nThe perfect dessert to end every meal. The shaved coconut sprinkles were a pleasant finishing touch. \\n\\n/THE OKAY/\\nPan fried pork baos:\\nThe baos and meat were a bit too dry. \\n\\nGarden vegetable dumplings:\\nA colorful and fun skin representative of an all veg dumpling. I just wish it was more flavorful/savory!\", u'Stopped by after some shopping in the area. Skipped lunch so was starving. So glad I stumbled upon this gem.\\n\\nI had the spicy pork soup dumplings and the pork baos. Both were flavorful and delicious. The soup to meat ratio on the dumplings was perfect and the soup was delicious. The steamed buns also had a delicious filling. \\n\\nWill be back!', u\"As a native Shanghai girl, I will have to say, the Shao Mai and Tang Bao is legit! This is what you'll taste in Shanghai. Staff was very friendly, and we got our food fast. \\n\\nPork tang bao: very very good! The soup inside the bao was light and flavorful, not greasy which is a plus! There was so much soup inside that when I took my second bite, the soup spilled on my pants... good thing is that the bao is filled with soup. Bad thing is that I wasted some soup on my pants :( \\n\\nShao Mai: this hit the spot! I've been craving Shanghai Shao mai for the longest and this place gave it to me! It's sticky rice with pork, absolutely amazing! \\n\\nSweet and sour ribs: a little dry, but the shanghai flavor is definitely in there. I don't know if I'll order this again, but it's good. \\n\\nGarlic rice and chicken fillet: pork and chicken fillet is a tradition in Shanghai. This chicken fillet is thin, juicy and crunchy, how a Shanghai fillet should taste like! Loved it! The garlic rice was just rice with garlic flavor, it was good but not a Shanghai dish. \\n\\nBeef with noodle: this was a bit disappointing. The beef is known as Hong Shao Rou, which is beef or pork cube with soy sauce. If this dish is done right, it's delicious. But sadly this dish was not done right, no shanghai flavor what's so ever, I'll give it a pass next time.\\n\\nOverall, I will definitely come back! Order the tang bao, Shao mai and the chicken fillet!!\", u'I trekked all way from the city to come here to taste those \"oh so delicious\" soup dumplings...\\n\\nThis is my second time coming here. I also got the chicken cutlet noodle soup for an astounding $9.85 per bowl and three orders of soup dumplings for take out. The fried chicken noodle soup was good but I didn\\'t like the fried chicken siting on top a bed of noodles. Inadvertently, the breaded part turned mushy. \\n\\nAs I finished my $10 inflated bowl of noodles, I ordered a side of fried chicken cutlet to go but when I got home, I was disappointed to see they made the portions smaller since last visit. I don\\'t think I would come back for chicken noodle soup - I also noticed they gave less noodles this time. I had the beef noodle soup last time and I liked it better since itwas more flavorful. \\n\\nThe place was packed from 7-8pm and takeout orders sitting on their counter waiting for the Uber delivery person for pick up.', u'You get the \"Xi An\" feel once you step into this place. Blasting pop music along with staff wearing their caps. You would think wait is this one of their branches. Walk all the way in and you\\'ll see a large menu-board to your left with picture and prices on them. Once you are ready step up to the cashier and order. Make sure to keep your receipt for the food and the bathroom code. \\n\\nThere are condiments to the right. All utensils, sauces, plates, napkins and tap water are all located in that one section.  I\\'m surprise to see a jug of vinegar and soy sauce. This is a self service restaurant, so once you order your food find a seat and wait for your number to be called. There are plenty of seatings on a Sunday evenings. Food came out fairly quick. We got the: \\n\\nBraised beef noodle soup: ($11.95) the beef was cut up into small bites, wished that it was larger chunks, can\\'t really taste the flavor in it. Came with yau Choy vegetables in which they gave only the stem. What happen to the full veggie? Prefers some people don\\'t like the end piece. Overpriced for a noodle soup. I can get the same thing in manhattan\\'s Chinatown for half the price and better quality. \\n\\nPork Mapo Tofu with egg over rice: ($9.65) too much sauce lead the dish to become overly salty. Not enough ground pork. \\n\\nBlue crab & pork dumplings: ($6.95) the soup dumplings was okay. I had better. \\n\\nAfter my meal, I really needed soda to wash everything down, as the saltiness of the food still clings to my mouth.', u\"You know a place is good when people dining there are of the nationality of the restaurant and there's always a good amount of people inside!\\nEverything I've eaten here is delicious! My favorite is the garlic cucumber salad! It is so full of flavor and very well-seasoned. Next, I always get soup dumplings and the pumpkin spice cakes I think they're called. Just delicious! Go and enjoy!\", u'Good staple xiaolongbao in Brooklyn. The layout makes me think \"chipotle for Shanghainese food\": think wooden benches behind a metallic counter that serves in turn of order time. I love the transparent kitchen that allows you to watch the chefs folding and steaming the bao. \\n\\nI wasn\\'t sure what to expect since it was my first time there but if I were to go again I would only order the XLB. I had ordered a variety of dishes and was honestly not as big a fan of the other items on the menu (noodles, pan fried buns etc). The noodles were kind of bland and he pan fried buns too doughy. That being said the xiaolongbao was juicy and delicious. I highly recommend if you decide to stop by.'], u'95.Liu\\u2019s Shanghai': [u\"Great Shanghai rice cakes, scallion pancakes, and fried wontons with peanut and hot sauce! Would definitely come back for these dishes!  Pork soup dumplings were okay- I definitely like Joe's Shanghai soup dumplings better.  We also tried the lion head casserole, which is a big pot of clear rice noodles, mushrooms, bamboo, cabbage, and meatballs. This was pretty good. \\n\\nWait staff were nice and food comes quickly!\", u'I don\\'t get what everyone is raving about. Is this really the best Bensonhurst can do?\\n\\nI\\'m willing to look past the \"C\" grade, as long as the food is delicious. But my dinner was far from delicious. Several dishes were super salty and I don\\'t know if this is from a lack of taste or overcompensating for hygiene. I would especially advise you to avoid the drunken chicken at all cost. Imagine cooking your chicken in a salt brine, chilling it, then pouring a shot of vodka over it per portion. No subtleness at all- just chicken, salt, rice wine liquor, chill, not specifically in that order. The fried udon noodles we got tasted straight out of a dehydrated udon pack you buy at the supermarket, one of the driest shanghai noodles I\\'ve had. Also, something strange: they brought out a bowl of rice for each person at the table that was never requested. Although we shouldn\\'t have eaten rice+noodles, the rice was needed to dilute the saltiness. And to my surprise, they charge you for the rice. At the end, we had sweet rice soup which tasted like Splenda and water. I really don\\'t know how you mess up there. \\n\\nThe restaurant is also awkwardly quiet at times, and although service isnt particularly slow, it does feel that way.', u\"Found this spot on yelp as I was around the area and wanted to try it out based off the good reviews I read! So I made the decision with my friends that this was where we were gonna eat. Parking in the area is always tough so I was the first one there to reserve a table for 4. I got seated down right away and looked through the menu as I waited for the others to find parking. The place seems to be family run so you knew the food was gonna be made with love! Once my friends and I were all together, we ordered a bunch! 3 orders of the Soup Dumplings, Fried Wontons with Hot Peanut Sauce, Scallion Pancake, Thick Noodles with a little of everything and the Sizzling Beef! Here's what I thought! \\n\\nSoup Dumplings: Really good and that's all that needs to be said, expected nothing less from a hole in the wall place. Good ratio in the stuffing and soup base was tasty.\\n\\nFried Wontons: Read a bunch of comments about it being too sweet and not that spicy but still wanted to try it myself. After trying one, it was on the sweeter side and could of used a little more spice kick but I still enjoyed it and it didn't stop me from finishing it all. \\n\\nScallion Pancakes: They were good, nothing amazing but good. I love scallion pancakes so I will always get and enjoy them whenever I see them on a menu.\\n\\nNoodles: Be Warned! When you see it on the menu, the prices of the noodles are all about $5-$8 so you think you'll be getting one portion of noodles. Nope, it is BIG and family sized. I am a sucker for thick noodles so I was happy with it. There was shrimp, chicken, pork, and a bunch of other items so it is true to its name. \\n\\nSizzling Beef: My friend ordered this all to himself and finished it with nothing left on the plate. I managed to steal a piece of beef and some onions without him noticing and I can see how he managed to eat it all. \\n\\nOverall, this place hit the spot and we left full and happy! Nice Hole in the Wall Place. I'll be back when I am in the area again!\", u'Hands down the best shanghainese cuisine in Brooklyn. Food & service is A+++', u\"The Dishes we got.\\n\\nA5 Pork Soup Dumplings\\nThe dumplings were very good. Maybe not the best I've had, but it was in the top tier.  The skin was thin, soup was very good and it came 8 pcs for $6. \\n\\nA8 Fried Chicken Wings\\nNothing  really special about these, but they were nice and crispy.\\n\\nA9 Scallion Pancakes\\nIt came sliced into 6 pieces and had a lot of scallions in them. The outside was slightly crispy, and the inside was soft.\\n\\n75 Sauteed Dried String Beans\\nI never really understood why veges dishes cost so much.  It was alright, but feels like you're paying for the sauce.\\n\\nS10 Crab Meat w Tofu/Veg\\nTofu was very soft. They use silken tofu and some brown sauce which was very flavorful.  There's definitely crab meat in there so if you don't like crab taste, don't get this.  I liked this one a lot.\\n\\nS12 Braised Lion's head meatballs\\nI typically don't eat meatballs, but these meatballs might change my mind.  They were so tender and tasty.  They're pretty big and I was going to try half, but I had to go back and grab the other half after I tried it.\\n\\nOverall, this place is my cup of tea..  The place is smaller than I expected so there might be a wait.  We ate an early dinner so was able to snag the 9 seat table in the back just as people were leaving.\", u'Food here tasted decent, and none of their food \"wowed\" me. I am a huge fan of Shanghai rice cakes, but it tasted just okay here, not the best.', u\"The best (and one of the only) authentic Shanghainese restaurants in Brooklyn. Usually you would have to go to Chinatown to get Shanghainese food, but Liu's has been here for many years and is a staple in this part of Brooklyn. While the soup dumplings are not as good as Nan Xiang's in Flushing, they are better than any soup dumplings you can find in Chinatown, by far.\\n\\nOf course the thing to get here are the soup dumplings. My personal favorite are the crab meat and pork, followed by the scallop, and finally the pork. The addition of seafood to soup dumplings imparts a subtle sweetness to the soup dumplings, which is so delicious. I also really like the fact that there's actual crab meat INISDE of the dumplings, and not just a tiny dollop on top (A LOT of places do this unfortunately), so you know you're getting your money's worth. At $8 for 8 dumplings, it comes it to a dollar each which is quite standard throughout New York.\\n\\nOf course, no Shanghainese meal is complete without the other notable foods. The scallion pancakes aren't bad (personally never been a fan of them), and the cold appetizers here are great. My personal favorites are the vegetarian duck and the kau fu. I also like the Shanghainese rice cakes here. It's super saucy with a lot of flavor and proteins. I also really like the twice cooked pork over rice here. It's super tender, but salty, sour, and spicy in all the right proportions. Definitely try this one out!\\n\\nOverall a solid (and the only) place to grab soup dumplings in this part of Brooklyn. The wait can get a bit long sometimes depending on the time you get to the restaurant (I've been lucky so far and never had to wait).\", u\"Even though it's approximately a 20 minute drive from home, I will always come back here if I'm craving soup dumplings (XLB= xiao long bao). I been here so many times and have yet to be disappointed. I would rather come here rather than traveling all the way to Flushing or Chinatown, because parking over there is a pain in the ass!\\n\\nEnvironment/Service: It is a family owned restaurant, so it isn't that big of a place. There are one big table, one medium sized table and a couple of four seaters. The waiters and waitress are always super friendly and I never had a bad experience. \\n\\nFood: Their soup dumplings are always good and fresh. Never had a bad soup dumpling from here! I will always get one order of soup dumplings every time I come. I finally tried their Fish Head Casserole and it was really really flavorful. Love the large amount of cilantro they put inside, because I love cilantro!\\n\\nI always come during peak dinner time and there is always a wait. Usually around 15-30 minutes wait, but that is not a problem! Definitely coming back here over and over again!\", u\"I love their fried vegetable dumpling with a side order of peanut sauce,  yum!  However, service could be better.  I've never been to an establishment where the staff sits with their phones out while sitting in one of the tables.  I really don't care to be honest, if the staff was attentive.  However, I had a hard time getting his attention to ask for drinks and condiments as the server was sitting down with his eyes glued to his phone. \\n\\nThe sizzling tofu entr\\xe9e was good, nice flavor.  I love the texture of the tofu, very soft, melts in your mouth and the caramelized onions was delicious to go with it.\", u\"I've been to this place years ago when it first opened but I've heard that they switched owners, so I decided to give this place a try again. I ordered the regular soup dumplings, scallion pancakes and the spicy chilis w/ beef noodle soup. I gave this place 3 stars because I was highly disappointed by the soup dumplings. The soup dumplings served lacked the signature soup that squirts all over the place, the flavor was alright.. it just didn't leave me wanting for more. I think perfecting the soup dumplings at a Shanghai restaurant is the key because soup dumplings are a staple icon in any Shanghai restaurant. The scallion pancakes were good, nice and crispy. The real star of the show was definitely the spicy chilis w/ beef noodle soup. The chili and beef was very flavorful, pairing quite nicely together. I would recommend ordering that with rice cakes next time. This place has great service and I would like to go back to try some of their other dishes.\", u\"I really like this local spot, and in particular LOVE the tasty rice cakes! I got them Shanghai Style, which had really yummy bok choy and pork strips. The soup dumplings are pretty nice, too! The service is really quick and friendly. I'll definitely be back!\", u\"I consider this place Bensonhurst's best kept secret. Chinese supermarkets and restaurants have been popping up left and right around the neighborhood.  They're mostly Cantonese style restaurants so I never thought I would find an authentic Shanghainese placewithout stepping foot into Manhattan Chinatown. \\n\\nNow you've probably already read and seen that this place is small. Its packed quite often. It's a bit of a walk from the train station but it is so worth it. None of that matters because the food is great and the family that owns the place is efficient and kind. \\n\\nIf you come here, definitely get the soup dumplings and the hot fried wontons. You won't find this quality of soup dumplings anywhere else in the borough. The wontons aren't that spicy, so don't let that steer you away from ordering them. They're covered in brown sugar which probably cuts down the spice level and you're left with a very faint hint of spiciness. The first time I had time I wish I had ordered another serving of them. They'll leave you dreaming about them until the next time that you come. \\n\\nAnother favorite that my girlfriends and I usually get is the crab hot and sour soup. Its loaded with actual pieces of sweet crab. I once had to stop drinking it so that I could savor the delicious chunk of crab meat. Just writing about is making my mouth water and I had it only two days ago. \\n\\nI've had other dishes and appetizers from Liu's that are all really solid as well. If you're having trouble deciding what other dishes to get, I suggest looking around the restaurant and see what else everyone else is having. They also offer free tong sui (Chinese dessert) after your meal. \\n\\nGo support this great establishment, just don't go when I'm going because I'll need a lot of table space for all the food I'm going to be ordering.\", u\"Our family been going there since my daughter was 2 years old. Now she's 8.  Consider us a regular customer.   Their juicy buns are the best. My husband loves them. He can eat 3 orders by himself.   They never disappointed us. Their food is always constantly delish. \\nWe usually order the lion head,  fish head casseroles.  So good,  chicken and broccoli, fried rice, and veggie duck, different noodle dishes. Somtimes I find their dishes being too greasy but if you requested to cook the dishes less oil they be gladly do it upon request. Very good service.  It could get crowded so might be a wait to get seats. Btw they close on Tuesday. I would recommend any one to give it a try.\", u'Delicious food, nice servers\\nClean place. Servers attending the tables well. Place was packed for a Thursday', u\"We tried this restaurant on a whim and this is definitely going to be one of our new go to spots.\\nFrom the minute we walked in the servers were so friendly and attentive. The waiter was happy to recommend his favorite items off of the menu and tell me good vegetarian options as well, I also\\n loved the older lady that was helping us she was so sweet!\\n    It was nice that they had a good selection of vegetarian items on the menu including some mock meat. I opted for the thick noodles with  because it's what the server recommended was good and the scallion pancakes. \\n      This little restaurant is perfect for a nice weekday meal, it's a little small so definitely only good for going with a couple of people they don't really have room for large groups you would definitely have to wait for a table of you came with more than four people. \\n      Over all I had a great experience the food was delicious and I will definitely be coming back.\", u\"I wish I knew about this place sooner!! I came here to try the fried wontons not knowing what to expect because I've never seen this dish served anywhere else but I am happy to say that I was not disappointed. The warm crispy fried wontons smothered in the savory and sweet peanut sauce and hot sauce topped with sugar and scallion are a must get when you come. We also got the shanghai style lo mein which was flavorful and had a good amount of meat and vegetables. I'll definitely be back (especially for those fried wontons) but you can't go wrong with a place that has friendly workers and good food with decent portions.\", u'Best Shanghai spot in Brooklyn. However, compared to Shanghai Cafe in Chinatown, Liu Shanghai is on the pricey side and the portions are smaller. Regardless, the soup dumplings here is very good. Just the right amount of flavor. My favorite thing here is actually the wontons in sesame sauce. Sweet and very nutty. I got to come back here to try other stuff on the menu.', u\"Liu's might have just set the standard for me of what Shanghainese food should aim for. Anyone who's familiar with this particular type of cuisine knows that it's always so oily and heavy. Not here. Every dish we ordered felt surprisingly light and had enough flavor to keep on eating without feeling overly stuffed. \\n\\nThe pork soup dumplings ( xlb ) were good. A slightly thicker skin than what I'm use to from Nan Xiang but overall a satisfying bite. Another dish we tried was the fried wontons w/ peanut and hot sauce. If you're a fan of peanuts then this dish is for you, otherwise skip as there are no other prominent flavors that come through that sauce. \\n\\nThe hot and sour soup hk style was on point! For about 8 bucks, you get a large bowl filled with a ragtag band of mushrooms, tripe, pork and imitation crab. Really great for those cold weather days. \\n\\nThe scallion pancakes are a must order. Delicious and comes with a sweet soy that goes well with anything fried. \\n\\nThe staff here are super friendly! \\n\\nI'll definitely be back. They should also think about expanding as well.\", u\"This little hidden gem in the neighborhood is off the hook.  I feel ashamed to say this, but I've lived two blocks away for over 20 years, and I finally came to check this place out.  I don't know why it took me so long, but I am glad I did!  \\n\\nThe service here was awesome.  The owner's son was very kind and answered my million questions.  It was a huge plus he spoke both Canto and English since I was able to ask for certain dishes I only know how to say in Canto. \\n\\nThe food here was awesome.  It was stuff I grew up eating as a kid - xlb, fried wontons, fried dumplings, noodles, scallion pancake.  Everything was made just right, and the price was just right.  \\n\\nThe place is also really clean and bright.  It was a huge plus to have the tv on while eating.  The place was constantly packed and people were constantly coming in.  I'm really glad to see this place busy and with so much business.  I'm glad I finally tried this restaurant and it's in the neighborhood.  I hope this place sticks around for a long long time.  It's a true hidden gem, and I almost wish it would stay that way before the secret gets out.  \\n\\nDefinitely worth checking out and I would say this is the best place in Brooklyn to get your xlb fix, much better than anything you can find in Bay Ridge and 8th ave.  I will be back!!!\", u\"I would give it 3.5 but had to scale down because the Shanghai xiao long bao's skin was wayyyy too hard and the meat was just mediocre. For me, xiao long bao is the main dish of a Shanghai restaurant. So if it is just mediocre, then the restaurant is also just mediocre. \\n\\nI'm not sure how they got a 4.5 star on Yelp. Perhaps it's the only shanghainese restaurant in the area? \\n\\nI've also tried their steamed wonton with peanut sauce and aside from just being a little on the sweet side, it wasn't too bad.\"], u'177.Tree House': [u\"My first visit to Tree House was on a Sunday, the place has a great atmosphere and great service. \\n\\n I stopped by with my friend on a Sunday and we were greeted by our amazing waiter henr\\xed. He was pleasant, understanding and very inviting. He was aware of the specials and also very open to answering questions about pictures that we saw from other help reviews. \\n\\nOn this lovely Sunday, we sat outside on the deck. On the concrete smoking it not prohibited but on the deck people are allowed to smoke outside. Sunday wasn't crowded, the music was lovely and neon outside you would think there were hugs but there weren't any. \\n\\n\\nWe ordered the sweet chili wings they were amazing. We also ordered 2 drinks. (Don't remember what the drinks were) but they were great . The place is very affordable. The wings were 9 dollars. We also ordered the sliders. The sliders were amazing also. We each has one crab and one salmon. Both were well seasoned and quite filling. \\n\\n\\nOn wednesdays we went back. They have a special event on Wednesday's that Henr\\xed made us aware of where they offer drinks inside of a pineapple. The drinks are amazing it gets a little crowded so, get there early. The pineapple guy arrives around 7.\", u\"Ehenri is the best bartender ever! He hooked me and my 4 girls up during happy hour, he's cordial and hilarious! The food is delicious and he made us great HH margaritas. \\n\\nThey have an outdoor area in the back, seems cute but we didn't get to experience full force. I will be back!\", u'Decided to check this spot out with some friends since it was close to my house. Based on the menu and it was Wednesday, I saw they were advertising for the pineapple drinks on Wednesday nights.  \\n\\nUpon arrival I was pleased with the location. The place was packed and the music was really good. The game was on so it was a bit loud but that was expected and it didn\\'t bother me. \\n\\nWe found a table in the back on the restaurant\\'s near the kitchen since all the tables were taken. A young lady came over  ( she never even gave her name and didn\\'t have a nice demeanor) and handed us 1 menu and 1 drink menu. Mind you there was 3 of us so after a minute of the 3 of us attempting to look at the menu together , one of my friends walks over to the bar to ask the young lady for more menu. She comes back in a few minutes after that to take out orders. I ordered the salmon burger and wanted the potatoes , which I was told they didn\\'t have. I then asked for a kale salad, she said they didn\\'t have that either. In fact they didn\\'t have any of the sides they were advertising on the menu except plantains and fries (which she should of told us when she initially gave us our ONE menu to look at) so anyways I opted for the salmon burger and fries , 1 of my friends ordered the same and the other ordered crab cake sliders and fries. Only one of us had ordered a drink at that point and 2 of us asked for waters because we were to damn hungry to start drinking alcohol and had anticipated on ordering a pineapple drink after we ate. \\n\\nSo the young lady comes back with the alcoholic beverage my friend ordered and walks always. My friends gets her attention and had to ask her to bring our waters. After chatting for about an hour and seeing many other food orders come out he window and that our \"server\" never came back to check on us or anything we started to inquire about our food. Homegirls response was \"he makes the orders as they come in and there\\'s only 1 chef and 2 other workers\" okay andddddd ? That really wasn\\'t my problem where\\'s my food after an hour of waiting ? She wasn\\'t doing anything  I find out the status of our order either so at this point I kindly asked her to bring the tab for the drink and that we no longer wanted to wait for the food. \\n\\nShe then goes to get an older gentleman who I will assume was the owner or manager. He was as kind and tried to figure out what was going out and offered us 50% off our tab but I was so over it I just wanted to leave. Home girl brings us our food even after I said I no longer wanted it , with part of the order still missing by the way. We still were not interested in the food. The gentle man comes by the table again and apologized and says we can take the food to go and he comp our tab. \\n\\nWe were so turned off by the whole ordeal , we left with our to go containers and walked into a restaurant across the where we greeted and served immediately. \\n\\nThis establishment has the potential but improve customer service and maybe more people cooking. I couldn\\'t even tell you how the salmon burger was because I didn\\'t eat it. But the food look decent. IF i were to come back here it would only be for drinks. Service is too slow.', u\"Good music... beautiful treehouse atmosphere, and strong rum punches! However, the service here has a lot of room improvement. Although the venue wasn't busy, or crowded, it took 45 minutes to get 2 sliders. This place is a good for a drink and music, I wouldn't recommend getting food here though.\", u'Food was okay.  Jerk wings were crispy and thick.  Sweet potato fries weren\\'t good.  Bartender was moody and kind of rude and told me \"he only had two hands.\"  Nice place to chill on a date but not the best service or food.  Would go back for the setup and atmosphere.  Just to drink though', u'I had such a bad experience here but first let me say that In terms of decor it\\'s a nice little space that play r&b slow jams and has a lovely backyard. Last week two of my friends and I stopped by after hearing so much about it and omg our waiter was so nasty. We sat at a table near the front door that had no menus so I simply walked up to the bar and asked one of the bartenders. He scoffed at me with this condescending tone saying, \"I\\'ll be right with you.\" Then, when he arrived, he gave my friends menus and completely ignored me because he was irritated by the whole ordeal. It wasn\\'t even that serious. So I just got up and left in the middle of the whole transaction. I won\\'t be back.', u\"The owner here Ella, she is always giving the bartenders a hard time doing their job. She stands BEHIND the bar and watches them like little sweatshop workers as if she doesn't TRUST them. Moments like this allow me and my friends to be uncomfortable as well. \\nOne night I came here one Monday early evening with a few friends, and we sat at the bar. Our bartender Tiffany was awesome, and funny! We had the Buffalo Wings, Shrimp, Sliders and Sweet Potato Fries. The food was great-- bar style snacks are my favorite. If the owner can sit down, relax and trust that her business is doing great with her employees, we will be back again!\", u\"A friend and I stopped at this place on a whim and it was well worth it. As soon as we entered we were greeted warmly.\\n\\nWe sat in the back patio area and were promptly given our menus by  Anree (I hope I spelled that close enough) was a great host and waiter. He was prompt, inviting, and understanding when we needed a few more minutes  to view the menus.\\n\\nWe ordered the sweet chili wings, salmon sliders, and crab cake sliders. The sweet chili wings were AMAZING so crunchy, and flavorful. Out of the sliders the crab was much better than the salmon, btw the sliders come in 2's so there isn't a possibility for you to have one of each of the options. The drinks are so strong that 2 is the perfect amount you'll need to get to your next destination. \\n\\nAll in all I loved this place drinks are strong the food is flavorful and true to its roots and the atmosphere rocks. I was informed that on Wednesdays they offer a special drink served in a pineapple. Need less to say I will be back on Wednesday. New neighborhood fave!!!\", u'The night we visited was crowded, the first hot night of the season. But we could not get anyone to get our drink and food order despite our best stare down. It was a bit noisy and we did not want to call out or flag someone down. If you seat someone, and you are taking orders, then take theirs, You know they are there, you seated them!\\nThe salmon slider was a bit slimy in the center and on a hamburger bun, simple burger by you get at the bodega. The shrimp were huge but a trifle over cooked. They get rubbery when large shrimp are cooked hard.\\nThe decor is the best. Outside seating is a must!\\nBut find a cushion because your back and tailbone suffer on hard surface.\\nI would go there again, for a drink and hanging out.\\nNot so much for food and service.', u\"Great place to grab a drink and relax to some awesome tunes.  I have been here a total of two times and each time I enjoyed myself.  First time I visited for a special event (on a weekday) which they had a guest bartender making pineapples with mixed drinks.  Second time I visited was on a Saturday night to grab drinks with a friend.  \\n\\nThey do have food but is very limited so I wouldn't bank on eating while here because each time I have visited they have been out of a number of things.  I have had the jerk wings which were nothing amazing because they didn't have seasoning and but tasted really burnt.  The hot wings are way better and worth the money.  \\n\\nThe drinks are reasonably priced somewhere around the $12 mark.  One of my favorite specialty drinks is Henny Tree. Yum Yum Yum :)  The music is always awesome and on point.  But the real reason you come here for is the backyard and the ambiance.  They had a DJ on a Saturday which was playing a little of everything in terms of R&B and Hip-Hop.  This is a great place to bring a big group of people if you get here at a decent hour.  This past weekend they had an outdoor heater in the backyard which makes sitting outside during the fall time that much better.\\n\\nJust a simple heads up they do add on automatic gratuity for sitting outside.  I didn't do the math but it was well over 15%. \\n\\nOverall if I am in the area this will always be a go to for drinks.\", u\"It is much cozier than a tree house. Good food. Good vibes. Good place to be. I ate my jerk tiger shrimp before I could take a picture  (I hate when I do that). They were scrumptious, delicious, a good size, just right. The seasoning was on the outside of shell, so if you don't want them too spicy you could take flavor off shell. The French fries were fat and meaty. Kale salad was small but full of feta cheese and apples. They had about ten beers on tap, mermaid beer, rebel ipa, angry Orchards, octoberfest and some more. Next time I will get a picture. I will be back. Salmon sliders were also flavorful.\", u\"I was really hoping and praying that this establishment will really fit how dope the patrons are. Went in with my friend just to grab something to eat after we finished at an art gallery across the street. \\nWe ordered a drink of the menu but was told that they don't serve it anymore (okay, no problem but why is it still on the menu and why wasn't that communicated with us before we sat down). Brushed that off and placed orders. My friend cannot stomach spicy foods so we ordered the plain wings for him and the Thai sweet chili for me, fries and the works. The food took suuuuch a long time (30 mins), we were both losing patience since we were starving. But the music was bumpin and we really wanted to support a fellow black establishment so we stayed put. \\nOur food came but it was jerk chicken on the plate. We looked at each other like. Ummm we didn't order jerk chicken. We told our waiter and he instantly caught an attitude telling us that we did. He even double backed to look at the receipt to check and argue us down. We simply said no how can we, when one can't handle spicy food? Maybe the music was too loud and he didn't hear us properly, but still. Who doubles back to argue down their customers? Like who does that? 20 mins later, he brings out the chicken and rudely throws it on the table that the plate shook. Like the plate of chicken rocked guys. It was subtly, but oh you can tell that was the intent. \\nWe had it! That was the last straw! So we just upped and left. And never returned to this place. Ever again. The patrons are dope the music is popping, we really wanted to support a black establishment that night y'all like hardcore. Went out of our way, but that waiter... no no no. Not again.\", u\"Had to update my old review and while I want this Black biz to do well, I'm not happy with something that happened last night. \\nI attended my friend's party here and ran a tab for my drinks at the bar. At the bar. Not the waitress. At the end of the night my bill showed an 18% gratuity. Where in the world do they do that??\\nI was too tired to complain. Yeah and they never have the sorrel punch anymore.\", u'Love the ambience of this place,food and drinks are reasonable,good music and I really enjoy conversing with their very  well experienced bartender Henri.My definite go to spot when I just want to chill.', u\"The service here leaves a lot to be desired; it was terrible. I am really disappointed in how my night turned out and how much time was wasted waiting in this restaurant last night, Wednesday. When I woke up this morning I was still upset. \\n\\nI came to this restaurant last night to have dinner around 8:30. This was my first time here. The restaurant wasn't crowded. I got to the restautrnat first and came in and took note of how nice it looked and was impressed. Then I stood there waiting for someone to acknowledge me and no one did so I decide to sit at the bar while I wait for my date. There are only 2 people sitting at the bar. I sit there for at least 10 minutes before the bartender even looks  my way. \\n\\nMy date arrives and we decide we want to sit outside but again there is no one to guide us or show us to a table. We walk towards the back and an older man, I assume the manager says we can sit wherever we want, so we seat ourselves outside. There is also a 40th birthday party happening out there also. \\n\\nWe get menus and order our drinks and meals. 15 minutes later the waiter comes back and says the kitchen is going to be closed for 20 minutes because they are trying to finish up the party. I didn't quite understand that because they had a buffet so what else are you preparing. We ask if we can get a least appetizer because we are hungry. He said he would check but never comes back and tells us if it's possible. \\n\\nWe wait and wait and wait. I few of the tables around us leaves. We end up waiting over 90 minutes for our food. At this time I'm already pissed off. We were actually get ready to leave when the waiter showed up with the food. The whole time no one offered us anything, not another drink, an appetizer, an apology. Nothing! \\n\\nNow onto the food. The food didn't even come close to making up for the amount of time we spent waiting. The entrees don't come with sides so you need to order them separately. My date ordered the salmon, well done. His salmon was burnt, visibly burnt and tasted burnt. Where does well done equal burnt. My shrimp was supposed to be jerk seasoned but it wasn't. Was just plain grill shrimp. After all that time at least the order should have been right. The rice and peas, I don't even know what to say about that other than it wasn't real rice and peas. And portions were small. We were both still hungry. \\n\\nI will never come back here. We received no apology, they could have at least comped some of our drink after the ridiculous wait. Next time if you have a private event just close the restaurant because clearly can't handle both.\", u\"Shhhhh (I promised my spouse that I would not write a review on this spot because the food quality, portions and flavor are so top notch. I could not believe that the ------ was so huge, fresh and affordable. Add in the ambiance and the playlist from the night we were there! He is scared that if I write a review like Samurai Papa BS - it will also become the review of the day and then the small restaurant will get too full and we won't be able to enjoy it as much). \\n\\nThis is my compromise. I'm not writing any specifics - it is definitely 5 stars.\", u\"As of now, I can only speak to the atmosphere and the lovely bartender, Brittany, and a couple of the cocktails.  I plan to return soon, probably for a sunday brunch session and give a full review of the establishment.\\n\\nFirst off, I love the vibe of this spot.  It's on a quieter avenue but it's lowkey location is reminiscent of it's chill atmosphere.  I stopped in here on a Sunday afternoon for drinks with a friend after leaving a much more gentrification influenced spot in Crown Heights where I had breakfast.  I immediately found out that I was just in time for Sunday brunch which included bottomless mimosas.  I was subsequently full and devastated. Anybody who knows me, knows that I live for bottomless mimosa brunches.  I almost decided to have a second brunch.  The bartender informed that this is only on Sundays but they are looking to expand to Saturdays as well soon.  Stay tuned for my update on that.  The restaurant is dimly lit artificially, but is beautifully lit with natural light from the front and back on a nice spring day as per my visit.  There is a cozy dining areas in the front a more group appropriate space in the back.  The bar sits midway.  Also there's a nice looking backyard patio.\\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier, the bartender was charming and the rest of the staff all seemed cheerful and to be enjoying their day.  It wasn't too busy, just steady in the place. The signature cocktails, The Bitter Sweet Greyhound, something Peach, and another on the list are all very tasty.  They are a bit sweeter because of the syrups which they all use.  The ingredients such as the bitters and fruit that they use are very fresh (at least this day) which made their drinks all the more refreshing.  And finally, there are beers on tap, and not just your average, we have taps so let's just put whatever beer we can here, but some nicer quality craft brews.\\n\\nI look forward to my next visit and maybe even becoming a regular here.\", u\"This is a nice charm in tha 'Stuy. The servers and bartenders are uber friendly and helpful. I had the Peach drink and the Apple drink (forgive me for not remembering) but they were sweet and a lil' strong. The vibe is very intimate, they also play some good music and they open pretty late.\\n\\nI'll be back to check out their food.\", u'This is a small chill spot.\\nThe vibes are positive. \\nBartenders were super cool and conversed. \\nDrinks were good as well as food.\\n\\nMusic wasnt overbearing and good playlist.', u\"I love this place. We met Nit the first time we hung out here. Love the alcoholic ginger beer and the chicken wings. We've also had the crab cakes. Everything is delicious and the staff are friendly and helpful. Recommended as a hangout if you're in the Bed-Stuy area!\"], u'125.Sunday in Brooklyn': [u\"Steak & Eggs \\nScrambled Eggs, Hot Sauce Hollandaise, Long Island Home Fries $25 (weekend only)\\n\\n\\n Well, #Corey \\u200d does it again \\u203c I asked for his top favorite plates and this was on of them.

I'm going to go back soon to give them a try. #Today I decided to let \\u200d#Corey pick my entire meal  .\\n\\n(Excerpts from my IG page, see videos there)\", u\"Came here on a Sunday with a group of five and was told the wait would be an hour and a half. It ended up being only 45 minutes which was a welcomed surprise so I'd recommend sticking it out since it seems to move faster than they tell you!\\n\\nThe pancakes are just a must. If it wasn't for them, I'm not sure if I'd be writing such a rave review. But oh man those pancakes are life changing. They're giant, fluffy, perfectly cooked, flavorful, and topped with an out of control hazelnut pralene maple sauce. They live up to the hype. MUST ORDER. \\n\\nI will say that everything else felt pretty average in comparison. We loved the biscuits and gravy and the sausage breakfast sandwich, but the warm grain bowl, burger, and avocado toast fell a little flat. But we honestly didn't care because of the pancakes. \\n\\nLove the atmosphere also. It's bright, open, there's a cute garden on the top floor, and it looks like a mix of anthropologie and restoration hardware. I can't wait to come back next time I'm in Brooklyn!\", u\"Made a reservation a few days prior and got to push it a couple hours back because we were running late. We were seated immediately upon arrival (and we got there maybe 25 minutes early than the revised resv) and greeted by our friendly server.\\n\\nThe place is lovely. Candle-lit and classy, with an average amount of noise throughout the night. The row of tables we sat at had them a little too close to one another - I felt like I heard all the conversation at the tables directly beside us, but it wasn't a big deal. It was surprisingly not as busy last night, but we were dining past peak dinnertime. For drinks, my boyfriend got the Japanese whisky cocktail, and then the orange creamsicle-esque tequila cocktail and I got the watermelon champagne cocktail. Took a but longer to come out but they were very tasty.\\n\\nThey have a section at the bottom if you prefer a solo-serving meal, but we went with the shared plates. The waiter suggested 4-5 dishes for a party of two. We were a bit hungry so we got a bit more. From top to bottom on the menu, we got: the buckwheat sourdough with salted beer and butter, the roasted squash, a salad from their specials, the black bass crudo, the bison tartare, the flat iron steak, and a they brought out a complementary wood roasted maitake mushroom.\\n\\nEverything was very, very, very, delicious. Each dish had so many flavors you never would've imagined would mesh well, just out there doing the dang thing. Some notable favorites were the squash and the bass. The squash was cooked to perfection; they've topped it with some kind of cheese that they didn't indicate on the menu. It was insane. We agreed that it was probably the best squash we've ever had. I loved the black bass crudo. I'm not normally one for raw fish, but the sunchoke, the gooseberry, and pickled chillis really sweetened down the saltiness, and there was still somewhat of a crunch. It was perfect.\\n\\nI'm very happy they brought out the mushroom dish for us because we would've missed out big time. It was cooked really well - you didn't get that squishy mushroom texture that most people don't love. Again, flavors!!!! I die.\\n\\nLike I said, everything else was enjoyable. I highly recommend coming here for dinner. We've yet to try their brunch as there is a massive wait during the weekend, but we hope to soon.\\n\\nSomeone give this place a Michelin star.\", u\"I had a great experience at Sunday in Brooklyn on Friday in September. Lol \\n\\nThis was the first place we stopped on a 1 day trip to NYC from Chicago. I had never been to NY before so I was excited and my cousin had a fun filled day planned for our trip which after picking up the rental car, we stopped here. The hostess Mary was delightful and was nice and sweet and extremely helpful, especially when I mentioned it was my very first time in NYC and we were doing a day trip. \\n\\nI wanted a grab and go snack so we could move forward with our itinerary and she suggested the carrot bread with cream cheese frosting. \\n\\nI ordered it to go and patiently waited in this adorably chic yet laid back environment that made you want to have a leisurely brunch  there every Sunday. \\n\\nAs for the food itself, the carrot bread was ok. It was dense and moist with a noticeable ginger flavor which is great if you like carrots and ginger and believe they are a winning combination. I enjoyed it, although it was not enough frosting. But since it was named carrot bread so you wouldn't have that expectation. It was a little expensive to me for a small loaf slice ($5) but hey it's NYC.\\n\\nThe customer service was great, the environment was pleasantly nice and whenever you have those components you will have that reflected in the price of the food. It's definitely worth checking out for breakfast and lunch and hopefully on my next visit to NYC I can enjoy a sit down meal there.\", u\"Sunday in Brooklyn typically serves brunch on weekends from 10-3:30 pm. Upon our arrival this past Saturday around 3, we learned that the kitchen was actually about to close because of a private event. Luckily we were able to grab the last two seats at the bar. It all worked out, but we definitely felt rushed to order. I'd recommend checking the restaurant's website to make sure that their hours are really accurate on the given day you're trying to go.\\n\\nI almost never get pancakes for brunch, but the malt pancakes, and especially the hazelnut praline sauce and brown butter, sounded like the most interesting menu item by far. The sauce, which is like a nuttier, saucier version of Nutella, added just the right amount of sweetness. The pancakes themselves were the best thing about the dish: They managed to be light, fluffy, and chewy all at once. You get three massive 'cakes, and there's not really enough sauce to go around, unfortunately. I did get like 3 meals out of this and ended up eating the third one at home with maple syrup.\\n\\nI also ordered the champagne problems cocktail (champagne, watermelon syrup, grapefruit aperitif). This is different from the version listed on the online menu, which is made with beets.  This was a pricey ($13!) but inventive and very refreshing riff on the mimosa. It was served with crushed ice, and also a super cute floral straw and a watermelon garnish. While this was indeed tasty, it was even more Instagram-worthy. I also got an iced coffee, which was surely a cold brew given how rich and delicious it was. \\n\\nThe BF got an egg and sausage sandwich (Gochujang Aioli, Crispy Potato, Cheddar, Brioche)- He thought it was good, but he wasn't blown away. \\n\\nMy main gripe is that the place really is pretty pricey. The pancakes were $16, which is... just too much for pancakes. Even really good ones.\\n\\n3.5 stars rounded up...but this one was close.\", u'Excellent service paired with tasty and filling food, surrounded by a trendy but rustic ambiance.  My wife and I shared a nice brunch with our 9 and 6 year olds.  I would recommend this for a family dinner, friends or quaint.', u\"Everyone, do yourselves a favor and get brunch at Sunday in Brooklyn. Don't let the fact that this is a super-trendy, one-bathroom for all, made-for-Instagram, full of beautiful people, restaurant deter you. \\n\\nFurthermore, get a sandwich for brunch: the spicy cauliflower one. It has Cabot Clothbound Cheddar, and sauerkraut on toasted whole wheat bread. It sounds weak, but boy it was delicious.\\n\\nThe straws are made of paper and have flower patterns. It's a nice, green touch.\", u'HYPE ALERT! Yes, this place is ~adorable~. And yes, you should take \"that friend\" that won\\'t leave Manhattan - it will surely convince them that Williamsburg should be added to their brunch rotation...\\n\\nThis is likely the worst service I\\'ve received in 2017. It was pretty comical actually - like the staff was going out of their way to be rude to us. It was not just a matter of being busy, never once were we asked how our food was. Beautiful space, teach your staff to be courteous and I\\'d love to return and try dinner!', u'Had the grain bowl. It was delicious and filling. Came with a half an avocado. Small but cute place.', u'SIB has been sitting on my bookmark list for a while until I finally got the chance to try it out today. It is a rustic place with woods floating around everywhere, except for table, which was marble like. Very trendy and insta-friendly!\\n\\nEarlier in the day, they provide both light breakfast and sandwiches, out of which I opted for the charred avocado toast, with pickled onion and Brussels sprouts on top. My favorite! The whole wheat bread below was also lightly baked, so carried a crunchy texture, paired perfectly well with the slightly smoked avocado pieces sitting quietly on top.\\n\\nBelieve they also offer great dinner options. Would love to come back and be impressed again!', u\"Sunday in Brooklyn is a pretty solid share plates stop, from the quality of their food to their service. \\n\\nA bass crudo, meat platter, roasted squash, roasted maitake, and potatoes with clams selection after, my date and I were fully content. \\n\\nThe bass crudo was great for the sunchokes and flowers--I thoroughly enjoyed it, but get something else if you want fish as the star. \\n\\nMeat platter was enough protein for 3-4 if you're looking for a tasting. The chicken liver mousse was a bit strong (I think it had cheese) so don't worry about asking for more bread. \\n\\nRoasted squash was SWEET and salty with a sauce that tasted like a mild gochujang. Definitely my least favorite and was only bearable because I doused it with their hot house sauce (ask for it). The seed coating was great, but not good enough to make up for the squash and sauce.\\n\\nSIB made a lovely roasted mistake served as a single cut with slightly charred caps. The greens and onions complimented the flavor of the vinaigrette and texture of the mushroom. It's very satisfyingly sour.\\n\\nPotatoes in dashi with clam was mild, warm, and comforting. Now to turn that into a soup...\\n\\nThe food is 3.5 because while it's satisfying, it's not particularly creative or worth traveling. Bump it to a 4 for the lovely service and decor. It's a great space to be in for a casual get-together.\", u'We came here for an early dinner with our kids.\\nOutstanding dishes :\\nBuckwheat bread with beer butter - could have eaten 5 more of that ! \\nCaesar salad \\nSmoked fish dish- melt in your mouth tender and cured inhouse\\nService was excellent even though restaurant was very busy when we got there.\\nBeautiful restaurant - loved the open kitchen.\\nWe cannot wait to return for their famous brunch!!!', u'Really good place to have a nice breakfast in Williamsburg. A little bit pricey but a nice service', u\"I loved the d\\xe9cor here. All very geometric and angular, from the coasters to the bar paneling, the shelving, and even the restroom mirrors. \\n \\nJust a random note - they have very short water glasses. Not the best when it's a heat wave and 94 degrees outside!\\n \\nTHE WAIT: None on a Monday at 1pm. A great way to get the brunch here if you're free on a weekday!\\n \\nTHE SERVICE: Very chill and friendly. Everything was quick, and our water pitcher was always being refilled. At the end of the meal as we were just hanging out and talking, we asked for another pitcher but never got it. The bartender was really nice and stopped what she was doing to fill my water bottle, though.\\n \\nCOST: $18.68 (including tax/tip) for a sandwich and pancakes, shared between two of us. Great value!\\n \\nSANDWICHES\\n* Egg & Sausage Sandwich ($13) - 4 stars\\nVery nicely done. Perfectly toasted bun. Must add hot sauce! \\n \\nPLATES\\n* Malted Pancakes ($16) - 4.5 stars\\nA little fluffy for my taste, but that hazelnut maple praline syrup is amazing! My friend really wanted to get this - he doesn't even like pancakes, but he says these are the best pancakes ever and tasted even better this second time he's had them!\", u'I love this placeee, it\\'s super cute straight out of a home design magazine. As soon as a step foot inside, it was giving major new Americana decor vibes.  I literally can pitch a tent and live here foreverrrrr. There\\'s something about a open air kitchen concept that get\\'s me going......\\nFood. DELICIOUS. But first, DRINKS.\\nI\\'m a fan of a well executed cocktail and \"THEY DID THAT\". We had the Champagne problems and the Red Herring. I loved my drinks and I love the super cute straws that came with it. If you are a fan of beets, definitely try the champagne problems. \\nNow...FOOD. Between the two of us we had the \"Egg & sausage\", House Smoked Salmon & Pastrami Black Cod & and the malted pancakes for dessert.\\nThe winner hands down was the house smoked salmon and pastrami black cod. It was so fresh and tasty. I definitely want to come back for their dinner menu.', u'This was our first time at Sunday in Brooklyn (on a Sunday) for brunch. Thankfully we made a reservation in advance - there was a long wait for walk-ups, but we were seated right away. We started with the \"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\" (their version of a Bloody Mary that had a strong kick), a cold matcha and the avocado toast with an egg on top that was great. For the main course we decided on the sausage and egg sandwich (omg, yum) and the grain bowl with smoked salmon (eh). They brought the wrong bowl out at first (cod instead of salmon) and I wish I would have kept that one after trying the salmon. It was so salty + the kale, just not for my tastebuds. \\n\\nSimilar to the other reviews here, we left feeling a little underwhelmed with the service. It was almost like one of our waitresses was doing whatever she could to say the least amount of words to us. I mean I know we\\'re in NYC, but come on...maybe she was having a bad day. \\n\\nOverall the food was good, but If service was a notch better, we\\'d be much more inclined to give this another star and come back again.', u'I had a fantastic brunch here and definitely plan to be back. First, I love that they serve brunch on weekdays and that you can make a reservation for two people. My friend and I showed up at 1 pm on a Thursday.\\n\\nThe space is very cute and they also have sidewalk seating. You can choose still or sparkling as your table water and they keep it coming.\\n\\nWe split a maple cheddar biscuit to start and it was SO good-super flaky yet rich and with just a hint of maple flavor. My friend got the avocado toast and I had the spicy cauliflower sandwich.  The sandwich was absolutely amazing. It was so flavorful without feeling too heavy and it came with a little wedge salad on the side which was also good. \\n\\nI almost dragged my husband there the next day, it was that good! Will definitely be back!', u\"I stopped by simply because I loved the name.  The walk up coffee window was a plus especially with fast and friendly service.  Thanks to Sunday I now have a cute straw fetish! I will return the next time I'm in Brooklyn.\", u\"A perfectly cute instagrammable brunch restaurant that's really not that easy to get to, but the malted pancakes are AMAZING. Probably destination-worthy. Fluffy yet chewy and satisfying plump pancakes, stacked up tall and looks so massive there's no way you could finish. And then you take bite after bite and before you know it, it's all gone. If this is the only carb you have at your meal, then enjoy every little bit. The hazelnut maple praline sauce is insane, and not too sweet at all, sort of like a salted caramel hazelnut sauce. \\n\\nHighly recommend the egg and sausage sandwich, the eggs and the bun are really fluffy. The house smoked salmon was quite good, a nice standard lox brunch dish and the pastrami black cod is definitely interesting in a good way. Charred avocado toast was pretty good, not quite as fancy as it sounds. Steak and eggs were just ok, the steak was tough and the sauce could be kicked up a notch. \\n\\nSeems the word's out about Sunday in Brooklyn as a must-hit new brunch spot - there was a 35-45 min wait for our table of 5 at 11:30am, but they text you when your table is ready.\", u'Best brunch I have ever had!\\n\\nMusts:\\nMalted Pancakes\\nPastries (Maple Cheddar Biscuit)\\nEgg & Sausage Sandwich \\nCheddar Scramble\\nCharred Avocado'], u'2.Butterfunk Kitchen': [u\"Thoroughly enjoyed the fried chicken best I've had since being in NY its seasoned so well. \\n\\nBiscuits are very yummy and even better with no spread. \\n\\nMac & cheese best I've had at a restaurant love the flavors of the cheeses used and you can taste garlic seasonings it was heaven to my palate.\\n\\nCrawfish puppies: Hush puppies were Tasty but a little on the dry side but overall flavorful and yummy\\n\\nRIBS: The ribs were also good as far as sauce and meat flavor but there was a lot of rub/seasoning which added extra things to chew almost to the point that your chewing a pack of seasonings it took away from really being able to enjoy the meat. \\n\\nWatermelon salad: very tasty and fresh; a great and new way to enjoy salad! \\n\\nAmbiance is perfection I love the feel and decor of the establishment and will bookmark this place as a restaurant to enjoy when in town.\", u\"I ate here last night and I legit can't stop thinking about this place. \\nLike. I may need to grubhub it this evening. \\n\\nI LOVED it. \\nThe decor. \\nThe music. \\nThe Staff. \\nThe beer. \\nThe food. \\n\\nI had such a great time, I cannot wait to go back. \\n\\nHush puppies and the sauce (the saucceeee) so delish. \\nThe fried chicken wings- what?!? Still drooling. \\nTruth be told- Mac & cheese wasn't my fave. \\nFried deviled eggs- marry me. Like. Marry me. Have my children. Mess up my house. I don't care. Just keep being deliciously amazing. \\n\\nCan't wait to be back!\", u\"Food: 4/5\\nService: 5/5\\nAmbience: 5/5\\n\\nThe interior is rather small but I didn't have to wait on a Saturday evening. The restaurant was nicely dimmed and i loved the decoration. Waitresses were attentive and super nice! \\n\\nI ordered the mac & cheese and it was the best mac and cheese I ever had. It combined garlic and cheesy flavors which made it heavenly. I also ordered the oxtail and lemonade fried chicken. The oxtail was so melty and definitely worth trying. I was pretty disappointed with the lemonade fried chicken as it was very dry... but the biscuits that came with the dish were yummy. Along with our dishes, we had a complimentary cole slaw, which was very refreshing. All these dishes combined was definitely filling for two people. We even had leftovers to bring home! \\n\\nRecommendations: Mac&Cheese & Oxtail.\", u'+++\\n- Plenty portion (One portion provides at least one other left over portion)\\n- Mac n Cheese was amazing city!\\n\\n++\\n- Love the decoration, soundtrack\\n- Lemonade chicken was good; but better re-heat value\\n- Sweet potatoes A+\\n- green beans were a nice addition\\n\\n+\\n- Corn on the cob\\n- They ran out of bread pudding for dessert\\n\\n-\\n- We put our name on waiting list, they said they would call us when our table were ready, they never did', u'What a comfy place. I came in & no problem to sit. Great place to unwind. Please unwind here after work. I hate most places, but, I enjoy this one.', u\"Great place. The location is lovely, well-lit and feels germane to the neighborhood. I love the family reunion feel of the decor. Beautiful photos of black family on the wall. The food was as good as the inviting decor. Southern fried chicken and comfort veggies and to die for rolls. Don't miss the Mac and Cheese. Eat well. Diet later.\", u'I hate how much I love this place.\\n\\nCame here on a Saturday night with a group of 6..easily accommodated.\\n\\nWaitress was helpful with the menu, made great recommendations including \"get the mac n cheese\", \"the catfish is a must\", and \"you can\\'t go wrong with the hushpuppies\".\\n\\nAnd she was right. The mac n cheese was cheesy and flavorful, the hushpuppies were delectable, and the catfish was disrespectfully mouthgasmic. \\n\\nBut what she failed to mention were how the biscuits were crack and the butter rice that comes with the catfish would wish you can tell your haitian mom to make her rice like that as well.\\n\\nNot one thing on the table was subpar..I\\'m sure if I tasted the napkin it would be up to par with our meal.\\n\\nUnfortunately, we were all so hungry none of us took pics. You\\'re just going to have to trust me on this one!', u\"I'm a little disappointed with this supposed neighborhood gem. \\n\\nI came here on a Saturday evening at 6 PM and had to wait 30 minutes to get seated. The interior is rather small with not many tables. Definitely make reservations if you can!\\n\\nAs for the food, I was sadly disappointed in the lemonade battered fried chicken, although I did have very high expectations because I LOVE fried chicken. The chicken was a little dry, and did not go well with the rice which is also on the dry side. I was expecting a side more like mashed potatoes or greens to balance out the dryness. The chicken was served with biscuits which had good flavor, but it would have been nice to have some gravy or grits to dip it in. I enjoyed the mac & cheese but didn't expected the cheese to be gritty, I prefer a more creamy texture. My favorite was the fried deviled eggs, it was both creative and delicious with robust flavor. They only had the one very tasty banana dessert, I liked it a lot even though the bananas were slightly frozen. \\n\\nThey also appeared to be short staffed, it takes a while for them to seat you and take your order.\\n\\nI definitely would come back to try other things on the menu! I hope you have a better experience than me!\", u'My bf said the chicken was awesome, but the veg options lack. The chicken fried tempeh is awesome, but the side that comes with (okra...& I LOVE okra) is sickenly sweet & very one note. Needs acid, & salt', u\"BEST MAC & CHEESE I'VE EVER HAD!\\n\\nI know, bold claim, but it's true. And I've lived in Louisiana. The catfish, fried chicken, biscuits, and coleslaw were all fantastic too. \\n\\nWorth the visit!\", u\"1. The braised brisket are to have. A bit salty but what southern food isn't. I give it a 4\\n\\n2. The fried chicken is good but paired with plain rice is just not tasty. I give this a 2.5\\n\\n3. Cole slaw (free with entree) was amazing. Give this a 4.5\\n\\n4. Mac and cheese was made with small shells and it was amazing. Give that a 4.5 to 5. Wish it was included in the 3 for $15 sides. \\n\\nThis place is good for sides but entres that i expect to be amazing.....are not paired right. \\n\\nThey also don't take reservations for smaller than groups of 6.\", u\"Can't remember how I heard about this place... but since it wasn't far from home I decided to give it a whirl.  \\n\\n1) It's off the beaten path, but right upstairs from the Ft.Hamilton stop on the F/G train.\\n2) It's pretty small: counter seating for 4 and table seating for about 30.\\n3) There is no Bar.... a few beers and wine items to choose from; So this isn't the place to come get loaded \\n4) With three serves everyone seemed a bit overwhelmed. They were cordial but not engaging. \\n5)Music selection was on point! A mix of old skill R&B\\n6) I ordered the Lemonade Buttermilk Fried Chicken w/ a side of Mac n Cheese and collard greens. The chicken comes w/ biscuits, buttered rice and coleslaw!  \\n\\nThe chicken: 3.5 \\nGood  crips and flavor on the outside, but we all know a Great Fried Chicken must be seasoned to the bone. This was not. A plus is the serving size, it enough for two people to share. \\n\\nButtered Rice: 5\\nNo one above the Mason Dixon makes buttered rice let alone serve it!  Just because they served it, I give them a 5; and it's good.\\n\\nThe Mac n Cheese: 4\\nIt was hit or miss. Some bites were dyn-o-mite, and others just tasted like boiled pasta!  \\n\\nThe Collards: 4 \\nGreat flavor, the smoke pork took it to another dimensions. The leaves weren't wilted to the point of no return. They still had some bite to it. The only problem... they were a bit salty! \\n\\nBiscuits: 4.5\\nYummy, light and dense at the same time. If the serving was bigger i would give it a 5\\n\\nCole slaw: 5\\nI am not a fan of coleslaw.... BUT THIS ISH HERE!!!!! I would come back just for the slaw! Crunch, salty sweet. Perfect combination! It was da BOMB. \\n\\nI would definitely come back!! \\n\\nHappy Eating!\", u\"So lets just get something straight here once and for all: fried chicken and white rice do NOT go together.  There is no dimension where they belong on the same plate.  It could be the most amazing white rice in the world, but not on my plate of fried chicken.  I even asked them to skip the white rice in my order, but they brought it anyway.  -1 point.  Also, didn't really taste any lemon in the lemonade fried chicken... and the white meat was a little dry.  Bleh.\\n\\nMoving along to the rest, I judge a meal by the things I save for my last bites... and my last ones here were the biscuit, and finally the mac and cheese.  Yes, unfortunately, the fried chicken was NOT the best thing on this menu.  The mac and cheese though, was.  AMAZING mac and cheese... and a damned fine biscuit.  So points there.\\n\\nNice people, nice atmosphere, great sides... but on the fried chicken list, they're sadly not a top contender.\", u\"Found my new favorite restaurant in Brooklyn a few months ago- but warning- pace yourself to avoid a food coma. \\n\\nButterfunk feels like an upscale juke joint era restaurant from Mississippi with Brooklyn style. \\n\\nThe appetizers are hearty and get the party started right! \\n\\nThe braised beef on a bed of grits was succulent, and sublime. A definite winner & my favorite entree! \\n\\nMy dinner companions had the lemonade-fried chicken which was down home good with a twist. The biscuits that came with it didn't disappoint either. \\n\\nI judge the credibility and quality of any soul food restaurant by its mac & cheese and Butterfunk shines here! This side was a perfect blend of creamy, cheesy and with a golden crispy top. They knocked it out of the park!\\n\\nThe banana pudding was just okay. I was hoping for old school, traditional with Nilla wafers and the Downtown spin though beautifully presented wasn't what I hoped for.\\n\\nI would love to see apple cobbler ala mode added to the options as well. \\n\\nThe deejay playing old school southern gospel really added to the decor. Smelling the comfort food and listening to the sounds, you were transported to the best in hospitality and cuisine the South has to offer.\", u\"I had been dying to come here ever since they opened and I was really excited when I finally got to check them out this week with some foodie friends.\\n\\nChef Chris is a really awesome host - you can tell he puts a lot of love and soul into every single dish. The menu here is curated very thoughtfully and the vibe here is super family friendly, down to his actual family photos on the wall.\\n\\nMenu items I consumed here included:\\n+   Butternut squash fritters with crispy pig's feet.\\n\\n+   Mushroom dumplings with Virginia bourbon caramelized onions & sour cream.\\n\\n+   Whole wheat rolls with corn butter.\\n\\n+   Roasted yam with a roasted/boiled/spiced/ peanut hummus.\\n\\n+   Buffalo pulled pork and potato waffle\\n\\n+   Fried chicken drumsticks \\n\\n+   Pork Osso Bucco with turnip hash in an apple cider reduction\\n\\n+   German chocolate doughnut with vanilla ice cream\\n\\n____________________________________\\n\\nEverything was absolutely delicious! My personal favorites were the fried chicken drumsticks which were brined in lemonade before before fried so their flavor was just off the charts and the buffalo pulled pork was amazing and the waffle was made out of seasoned potato...as the chef put it, it was like a big french fry!\\n\\nThe pork osso bucco was also amazing. The meat was so juicy and tender that it fell right off the bone. I also would have never thought that hummus out of spiced peanuts would be so good! The German chocolate doughnut was a perfect way to cap our meal. It was decadent but not overly sweet so the vanilla ice cream was a perfect touch. \\n\\nI can't wait to come back again soon and try their Mac & cheese along with everything else on their menu!\", u'If there are two things I love \"Butter\" and \"Funk\" cool funk not stink funk. Why on earth would I not visit this restaurant. To top it off it\\'s soul food *heavens gates open* I pass this cozy restaurant nearly every day walking to train, and it\\'s unique name drew me in on a Sunday evening. It\\'s open seating area is very intimate and dimly lit. \\n\\nEverything I tried was flavorful, the lemonade fried chicken was marinated and had a nice batter. The green beans were seasoned with turkey.  The biscuits were glazed with honey and nicely dense. I loved the decor as it used photos from a blended Asian and African American family. There was a dj spinning good music and the staff was pleasant and attentive.', u\"I really want to like this place but it's just average. There's always something that makes the overall experience feel off and mediocre. I'm kind of 2.5 stars on this place.\\n\\nLet's start with the food. The fried chicken is really good. The mac and cheese is top notch and they know how to make it just right. Be warned; it's so rich you'll have to share it or take part home. Their Wednesday wings are a-ok--kind of tiny and just average tasting.\\n\\nWith the exception of one time, service has always been really off. Every time I've gone there, I've waited a long time for menus, then a long time to order. The place isn't big by any means and the menu is a one-pager. Forget water refills. I think I've only received a refill once when I've been here without asking. If you're going to take forever to refill water, just leave a pitcher on each table so you don't have to be bothered.\\n\\nI wish I liked this place more since it's a hop and skip from me. Shame. :-(\", u\"Let's start off by saying I would give this place 6 Stars if I could!! I was once surprised at how much flavor every single bite of everything had.  We ordered our food & as the waiter was walking past with someone else's mac and cheese, it just looked that good that we had to order it too.  Well thank goodness we did because that was the first thing that came out and holy hell was is SLAMMING! It was oozing with the perfect amount of cheese and warm and just melted in your mouth. Then... ahhh arrived my chicken and waffles!  I had to mentally prepare myself to stop eating 1/2 way through this delicious meal since I wanted to save some for lunch the next day (ugh EXTRA i know lol)!  This place was really so damn good that even though I was full, I had plenty of room for dessert! Holy shit was it amazing, banana puddling! Sweet, soft, delicate and fresh! It was so damn good, we really thought twice about licking the bowl. LOL! Highly recommend this cute spot.  Very chill vibe and the servers were knowledgeable and super convincing.  Described the menu in a way that you couldn't NOT order it!\", u\"After an intense search on yelp, trying to decide on a place to eat for 4 picky eaters can be an impossible task. We finally decided on Butterfunk. \\n\\nLet me tell you, I have not had such an amazing experience in a long time. The food is to die for. Since there was 4 of us, we decided to get a collection of items from the menu to share. And every single item was superb. \\n\\nIf you are close by (or even far), stop by and I promise you won't regret it.\", u'G.E.M, first I have never heard of or seen Butterfunk. I came across this restaurant after the amazing CURLFEST2017 and hunger strikes. So, we walked in and was immediately seated. You know it was described as soul food and I\\'m always skeptical because not even the famous soul food restaurants are the best. Well, this place won my heart and soul over. We started out with the crawfish hushpuppies and they were goooddd and that old bay remoulade sauce was perfect. For the entree we both ordered the chicken, literally the basket of drumsticks and the lemonade buttermilk fried chicken. We was too hungry to understand the 8 drumsticks..lol. That chicken was amazing with BUTTERed rice like \"why sway\". U know we had to take home that food and I had it for lunch the next day and it was even better. Thats how you know it\\'s real soul food. \\n\\nWhen the food came, the portion size was huge. So unexpected. The dishes were shareable. Those biscuits were amazing and soft and really tasty. We had side orders of collards and Mac & cheese. The collards were amazing, they really tasted like my mothers. I\\'m a young black woman & I only love my mother collard greens & grits. This was good enough to make us really look for the chef and spot him out like a local celebrity. lol I have to mention the Cole slaw, I am not a fan of anyone Cole slaw, but that right there was amazing. Me and my sis was debating on who was gonna have the last bite. DELICIOUS. \\n\\nOkay only con was the Mac & cheese, was too cheesy no Mac. I like greasy food but I don\\'t eat fried cheese. It was too much for my taste buds. \\n\\nThe best thing about this place was that the food was not salty, commonly soul food joints usually are heavy with the salt and this place was not. I will definitely be going back to this place again and bringing the family.'], u'178.Leaf Eats & Deli': [u'Great buffet deal and super friendly staff. Plus you can bring your take out next door to The Way Station, drink a beer and enjoy live music or a photo with the TARDIS.', u'Solid addition to the neighborhood offering something different (seeing that we already have Mexican, Indian and Thai on lock). Decided to give them a shot after walking by so many times. Great buffet with lots of options. I believe the menu changes daily, with lots of proteins to choose from (chicken, fish, shrimp, ribs).\\n\\nOther highlights for me are:\\n\\n- They take credit cards \\n- Smoothies and fresh wheatgrass shots (yes there is wheatgrass literally growing in the store)\\n- Create your own pasta bowl or salad bowl\\n- Chicken wings and empanadas', u'It has a large variety of delectable comestibles and is easily adjacent to my local bar (which allows people to eat takeout). I happen to be a fan of buffets and this one is very suitable to my needs. The atmosphere is very genial and the staff helpful and friendly.', u\"Great new addition to the neighborhood with a nice lunch buffet. Food is good and affordable. Service is always fast and friendly. It's a good place for a reasonably priced breakfast, lunch or dinner.\"], u'25.Newyorktitlan': [u\"I mean, I don't think I have the words... MY OH MY. Server went above and beyond. Very friendly and helpful as soon as I walked in. Quiet spot beautiful art great music. NOW THE FOOD! I'm going to try but you must try words doesn't do it justice. \\nI ordered the huevos Benedicto with a side of  truffle avocado and a cinnamon cold brew! First bite wakes up your taste buds, delightful, deliciously, flavorful... It was made with love and passion, I was left speechless, closed my eyes as I savoured my meal almost licked my plate and knife, took lots of will power!\\nI have a few friends I'm bringing here soon! \\nThank you for letting me discover this GEM Yelp.\", u'Amazing modern twist on traditional Mexican dishes.  My son being 7, had a cheese omelette that was fantastic.  I had the Chilaquiles with Chorizo and egg over easy. My husband had a scramble which was also super tasty.\\n\\nNice addition to. Neighborhood, great lil gem to stumble on', u\"This place truly is a gem! A big thank you to yelp for helping me find this place. The food is not only mouth watering but satisfies every taste bud you currently crave.\\n\\nI went in wanting something savory but also sweet because of the pictures from yelp. The waiter (owner) gave us recommendations and we ended up getting French toast and Sopes. All their food is homemade from scratch and boy was it delicious! He also mentioned that the food was from family recipes. \\nI'm sure the hours make it difficult for others but I feel it makes this restaurant even more special because the food is meticulously created. I will be eating here again.\", u\"Well I'm glad I came on a Tuesday because I was actually able to experience this little gem.  Based on reviews, I'm guessing the experience might be different on a weekend.\\nI was greeted as soon as I entered and the waitress was quiet but friendly. \\nI tried the avocado toast (sandwich) and I added the salmon. It was delicious and they should actually consider making it a toast because with all the stuff that's on it, it's pretty filling without the top slice of bread. \\nIt was light when it came to the sauce, which I appreciate. \\nThey seem to have a good variety of drinks and it would be awesome if they could at least get a wine licence so I can have a mimosa with my meal. \\nThis is definitely a place I would return to if I'm ever in the neighborhood again. \\n\\nIt's cute that you can pay right at the table with the iPad register. \\n\\nThey are missing one star for fact that I have not seen them in action during busy times. That might have made a big difference in my experience.\", u'Extraordinary... nice place, delicious food, excellent service! Ridgewood is changing so fast, I am so glad to have Newyorktitlan in my neighborhood. I highly recommend this restaurant :)', u'This place was a lovely surprise. We went in for a quick brunch, and ended up having a three course meal, only because the waiter was so great at recommending various dishes from the menu for us to try. He also kept on topping up our coffee and water, no extra cost. When having dessert, the chef himself came out to explain the concept behind the dish. They both showed genuine passion for what they were serving, and treated us as if we were in the finest restaurant. Recommend!', u\"I go here almost every weekend! We love anything made with their in-house made chorizo, like the  Benedict and sopes. The pancakes are also divine! I've had the green tea, dulce de leches and the s'mores. The pancake are fluffy and the flavors are so unique and taste amazing! We also just recently went to taco Tuesday night. This guy makes the best tortillas I've ever had and I know good tortillas. The fillings are amazing as well. There's the el pastor with fresh pineapple, carnitas with chimichurri sauce, mushroom and cheese, the chorizo, and last but now lest the squid. Basically get anything here and it gonna be amazing! One of my favorite restaurant in New York!\", u'Food is absolutely delicious !! Been here several times and it is always executed to perfection. Great place to have in the neighborhood.', u\"We moved into this neighborhood recently and this has quickly become our go-to spot for any time of day. My wife and I know Mexican cuisine very well, and this place is the real deal. The sopes are unreal good. Free refills of the ice coffee?? Unheard of; much appreciated. Cozy, small, relaxed. The flavors are unique and superb-you can taste that everything is made from scratch, from the frijoles to the chorizo to the tortillas to the salsa. This is not some fast food place so don't expect to just pop in for a burrito and run...enjoy what you can immediately tell are true time-tested family recipes packaged in a little Bushwick shotgun space. I'm still trying to figure out the complexity of the frijoles...someday will build up courage to ask.\", u'Not even remotely ready for prime time.  We arrived at 1245 to a full house, and decided to wait. When we sat 40 minutes later, two of the tables that were full when we got there were just getting ... coffee!  The waitress then told us that they were out of two of the four main dishes.\\n\\nWe left. \\n\\nA nod to the friendly but completely clueless service.  No reason to sit for an hour or more and not get to eat.  Ridiculous.', u\"My friend and I came for late brunch today. It's a small place but it's super cozy and service is great. Food was fantastic and we will definitely be back.\", u\"Came here for the first time yesterday with my best friend who's a regular here and I completely understand why she loves it so much. The service was amazing and the food even more amazing! I had the French toast with fresh strawberries and blueberries and you can top it off with *drum roll* Bourbon maple syrup. I accompanied it with a cinnamon brew they had yesterday which was delicious and when we were done eating they brought us a new plate they're thinking of doing for us to try. It was a Tres Leches pancakes with freeze dried strawberries and it was absolutely delicious.\\n\\nOverall, this place is a little gem only a 2 min walk from the Myrtle-Wyckoff Ave Station where you would definitely have an incredible brunch experience.\", u\"Excelent !! So much love and effort is going into this food...\\nBeautiful, complex flavors, and a kind and caring staff. So happy to have stopped by.. we are so so stuffed and yet we're about to order a third item because it looks so good!\\nOur only regret is we didn't take photos!\\nTIP: go with the staff's recommendations!\", u\"Chilaquiles was very good. Latte was average. No liquor license. It's hot in this restaurant. Turn the AC lower than 83 when it's 80 outside. Very limited seating. Smash Mouth played on the radio. The menu is mostly Spanish. I would come back again for the food when it's cooler outside.\", u'I came for Sunday brunch and love it! Its cozy ambience with food that kicks a lot of flavor wants me to come back. I tried the moyete sandwich with a side of home fries. Definitely worth a try. Service is an extra plus, too!', u'Such good food! Well worth the trip to Brooklyn. We enjoyed the Sopas and the French toast - both super yummy!! The place is small - only a few tables. Very intimate feel. Casual atmosphere.', u\"It was very good.  Shocked I didn't notice it was around the corner from me all this time!  Highly recommend.\\n\\nNever hard to get a seat.  At least for now anyways, though I like never having to wait I do hope they get busier, staff is very courteous and this place deserves as much success as possible!  They're also very affordable relative to other places of similar quality.\\n\\nI've come back a number of times since a friend of mine found this place.\", u\"The owner/chef is awesome! His chorizo eggs, tacos and grilled cheese are all delicious and filling! Definitely put their homemade hot sauce on everything- it's not that hot but has great flavor.  It is a very chill spot and I'm definitely going to check out his pre-fixe taco Tuesday for dinner. There's also these delicious bushwick-made ginger ales called Bruce Cost Ginger Ale that go well with every dish I had. Right now they are open for brunch/lunch and some days for dinner.\", u'Food is meticulously prepared as if it were a work of art. We had the huevos benedicto, moyete, french toast and cinnamon cold brew, latte and hot chocolate on our first visit. All dishes were made with quality and fresh ingredients. Will definitely be returning.', u\"My boyfriend found this place and suggested we go here for brunch. He's pretty good at finding a decent restaurant so I went along with it. He knocked it out of the park with this choice!\\n\\nThe service here is amazing. It runs on a small staff but they're very attentive. \\n\\nThe food is perfect! Everything tastes delicious. \\n\\nI got the grilled cheese with truffle oil YUM! And my boyfriend ordered one of the many egg dishes. Both were amazing.\\n\\nThe waiter made my day when he brought out a smores pancake the kitchen had whipped up. Again it was delicious!\\n\\nIf you're looking for a bite to eat and you're in the neighborhood, you can't go wrong with Newyorktilian.\"], u'181.Hamilton\\u2019s': [u\"I love this restaurant! I've been here a half dozen times and the food and service is always excellent. I love the kale salad and vegetarian orzo. I tried the tropical salad tonight which was a great blend of sweet and spicy. The lemon tart was delicious. We ordered a side of chicken of a stray cat we've seen here before and they were super nice about it. \\n\\nGreat outdoor seating, very relaxed, can't ask for more!\", u'I\\'ve been to Hamilton\\'s for brunch twice now and I wouldn\\'t hesitate to go back again and again.  Both the food and the service are excellent! I find the staff to be especially friendly and attentive, and anyone with dietary restrictions take note - they are very knowledgeable about food allergies and food preparation to ensure that you will be safe. \\n\\nWhile they don\\'t have a full bar (beer & wine), they do serve a Soju Bloody Mary that is FANTASTIC and you\\'d never notice it had a lower alcohol content than your standard Bloody. It\\'s peppery and horseradishy and, quite frankly, addicting. \\n\\nOn the food side of the menu, good luck choosing! There\\'s an emphasis on healthy ingredients, with many organic foods and vegan/vegetarian options. The menu boasts that they \"use organic eggs, all natural chicken and grass fed beef\" and it shows! The sunny side up eggs atop my beef hash were enormous and delicious. The grass fed burger is to die for, as is the Ella Fitzgerald sandwich which is somewhere between a monte cristo and a croque monsieur. Other diners at my table enjoyed the Tofu Scramble, the Eggs Benedict and the Huevos Rancheros, and we also shared two slices of the Flourless Chocolate Cake and boy was it decadent and amazing!\\n\\nI highly recommend stopping in if you\\'re in the area, I don\\'t think you can go wrong with anything on or off the menu.', u\"My daughter and I decided this was the choice for dinner. We walked from her place and when we get there, I decide it's a nice night to eat on patio. \\nThe hostess tells that we can do that, but then forgets to tell the waitress as we sit unattended. Lol. \\n\\nI get her attention and she is new, but apologized like ten times over. Brings us some corn nuts and water to make up for her forgetting. Lol. \\n\\nAnyway, when the waitress does arrive, my daughter orders the roasted chicken with polenta, I order the jerk chicken with salad. The dishes arrive a short time later with good presentation. My daughter enjoyed her dish, and I did also. The chicken was tender and polenta was very good. My jerk chicken and salad was very good. Just the right amount of spice. The salad was very good too. \\n\\nWe then decided to share a strawberry shortcake with there home made biscuit used as the cake. Different but very good. \\n\\nI'll be real honest, when things started out bad, I wasn't going to even rate this place, but I'm glad the service turned around because the food was very good and so was the dessert.\", u'Been here a few times and love it. The attention to detail impressed. First time I had their oatmeal and was expecting, well simple, a bowl of oatmeal, what I got was a bowl of wholesome tasty goodness with tons of delicious accouterments. The other time I got a sandwich I forget the name, but think it was named after a girl, OMG so good, it was the perfect blend of flavors with the bread just right. Will definitely be back!', u'Updating after eating the food. While I think the place has a great outdoor space and beer selection (5 stars)...I was disappointed by the food. Mussels were a little bland and veggie burger was dry. The tomato appeared pretty old.', u'NO DOGS ALLOWED: I called to make a reservation for brunch and mentioned we were walking a mile or so WITH A DOG and would love a table outside. The woman I spoke to said \"Don\\'t worry just come by. We\\'re not that busy.\" We got there and we\\'re told that they had a \"no dogs policy.\" I pointed to a dog (see photo) belonging to one of the patrons. \"What about THAT dog?\" I guess they hadn\\'t seen THAT dog (??) The staff didn\\'t make an exception for us so we left and won\\'t be back.', u'I am so impressed with everything I have had there. The salad is perfectly dressed which is not easy to find. The Ella Fitzgerald Sandwich was something special. The Arnold palmer is made fresh. Yummy!!!', u'Ordered the french toast with fruit for brunch and was very disappointed. The toast is only one slice that is way too thick and the fruit consists of half a banana and one strawberry(They slice it to try and make it look like more). Had better for less at most corner stores.', u\"Loved that it was good food, drinks & had a patio we could sit with our pup. We went out of our way to eat here a few times just so we could have him with us. Got turned away because of the new NO DOG policy. The patio will be closing up soon anyway but it's a shame they're sacrificing a lot of business in the last days of summer.\", u\"Just ate here. The food was good to fine. The one thing I loved was the potato rusti. My friend and I agreed it didn't blow our minds but sustained us. The service was slow... reeked of bacon. I hate bacon so the smell was very overpowering. The outdoor area looked lovely!\", u\"Came here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. The place isn't huge so seating can be tight. Started off with a Bloody Mary. A nicely done homemade mix. Slightly spicy, but not overwhelming. For my meal I had the Ella Fitzgerald. A breakfast sandwich named after one of my favorite singers. How can I go wrong!  It was very good, as were the potato wedges that I got with it! My son ordered a burger and moaned from the time he started eating till it was gone! Service was prompt and friendly. Will definitely make this a stop again!\\n     Be aware. There is a church directly across Fort Hamilton Pkwy.  On a Sunday morning with services going on, parking can be a problem.\", u\"Don't think twice about getting the Mac & Cheese. And add the bacon. I picked it as an entree and had trouble finishing it. \\n\\nThe Brussels sprouts topped with lemon and feta are deeeelicious and perfectly charred. Brussels sprouts are usually a hit or miss item, and these are cooked to perfection. We were less impressed with the burger which was on the smaller size. Not sure it was worthy of the $15 price tag but it was prepared well. \\n\\nDon't forget to end your meal with the lemon tart. They switch out the standard graham cracker crust for saltines, and I was a bit skeptical at first but it is so freakin' delicious. If you're a fan of sweet/salty you'll love this.\\n\\nPro tip: scoop out the tart onto your plate. We did this at the suggestion of the waitress and it made it so much easier to get the perfect bite.\", u\"Hamilton's is our neighborhood pub. We were so happy when they first opened and still go regularly. The service is inconsistent and indifferent, and the food options are super limited. Prices seem to have risen as portions reduced. Today I went with a friend and knew exactly what I wanted to eat. We waited for ages to be acknowledged, longer to be seated. Never got menus, but we knew what we wanted so we ordered it. 20 minutes later the waitress comes to tell us they don't have either of our choices today. She'll bring us some menus. No. We're leaving. It's going to be a while before I go back. Looking for a new go to in Kensington. Please open one!\", u'I was completely unsatisfied with my experience at this \"restaurant\". When I called them at 4:45, the person who picked up the phone transferred me to the manager. I do not know how this so-called \"manager\" got her position. Before I even had the chance to start talking, she said , and I quote \"You don\\'t call a restaurant on a Friday night \" and hung up. No manager, or any person, should have that attitude towards a customer . I do not understand how a person like the one I \"spoke\" to can be a manager. Even before this experience I have gone to this restaurant and was completely unsatisfied with the food.', u\"This place is awesome. You know when you want to go out to drink but you're also hungry. So either you go to a bar and have some bar food. Or if you want good food, you sit in a fancy restaurant and order a cocktail. This is a great bar and a great restaurant ! I was very surprised by how good the food is. Between the visit there recently and the one prior to that I've had mussels, kale salad, artichoke salad, crostini with goat cheese, spices olives and smoked salmon, ginger honey cocktail, lemon custard in a jar, French toast brioche dessert. Yum! Everything was sooo good. I need to go back.\", u'I used to go here and sit in the (very expansive) patio area with my dog to enjoy a beer or two, but suddenly I am now being turned away because they now have a \"no dogs\" policy, even outdoors in the unfenced sidewalk portion. In a neighborhood where every other person I know has a dog, this is just plain bad business.', u'Excellent Windsor Terrace restaurant ! Every beer on tap ! I love the pasta with feta olives and olive oil, The burgers are awesome. I am a bread pudding lover and they have excellent bread pudding. The waitresses are super friendly and a very warm cozy place. The sandwiches like pulled pork and chicken sandwich are amazing !! Definitely a place to try', u\"Let's lead with two positives :\\n1) very pleasant front patio to enjoy your meal on \\n2) excellent beer list and cozy menu with tasty options to please a variety of tastes\\n\\nHowever I have just had a bizarre service experience that truly negates the other 4 or 5 good ones. I ordered a Reuben and asked for American instead of Swiss cheese. The obnoxious waitress (Eve M) rolled her eyes , shot me a dirty look and stated they don't 'do substitutions' . When I politely pointed out that Hamilton's has been quite accommodating in the past, she then proceeded to tell me 'what's going to happen is that we will put American cheese on it and then you'll return it because you will say you won't like it!'  \\n\\nUmmmm...who does this bizzle think she is !? Last I checked, me and the hussy have never met so surely she doesn't know what I like and don't like. Regardless, the interaction would have been fine if she left it with the 'no substitutions' comment, but she preceded into the realm of overt rudeness. I'm really annoyed at myself that I left ANY tip and even more annoyed that people feel the need to belittle and insult their customers when they are in what could be a really positive and fun industry!\", u'You know, it is the little things that stand out in your mind, good or bad, that shade your opinion of a place. In Hamilton\\'s case, it was a mere 50\\xa2. More on that later.\\n\\nWe sat outside after being seated for 10 minutes before a server arrived to greet us, but when she did, I ordered a Bell\\'s Two Hearted IPA , but all the drafts are $6-$7, MUCH LESS than most places in the NYC metro and they have a GREAT SELECTION. I had to hunt down another server because ours was nowhere to be found, ordering a Smuttynose Old Brown Dog (also $6 on the menu), but after another 10 minutes our food had arrived and still no Smuttynose, so I reminded our server. It arrived 5 minutes later while my dinner cooled whether it needed to or not.\\n\\nMy wife ordered the large Salty Pretzel ($4) and a Mac and Cheese appetizer ($8). The Mac and Cheese arrived with my sandwich, but we had to remind the server about her pretzel which took an additional 5 minutes to arrive. The pretzel was good, but it was hot from the oven and too crunchy, not warm, soft, and chewy as a good pretzel should be. The mac and cheese was tasty and a decent size portion for an appetizer.\\n\\nMy Reuben Sandwich ($15) was piled high with \"house made corned beef\", sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and thousand island dressing. It was very good overall, but the house made corned beef had a slightly strange aftertaste which I could not quite put my finger on, or my tongue in this case. The accompanying potato wedges were scarce, but decent, nothing special.\\n\\nWhen the check arrived, I have to admit that it was one of the smallest totals we have seen since arriving in NYC, but the Smuttynose was listed at $7 instead of the $6 stated on the menu. I called our server over, showed her the menu and the check, and asked her to make the correction to the $1 error. Those things happen. But when she came back, she had NOT deducted the $1 error, but had discounted the check by a mere 50\\xa2! Rather than argue about the 50\\xa2, I deducted it from her 20% tip along with a tad more for her inattention during our meal. It is always the small things.\\n\\nCombatCritic Gives Hamilton\\'s 5 Bombs Out Of 10 After A 2 Bomb Service and Check Error Deduction ... More Bombs Are Better!', u'All summer Hamilton\\'s was our favorite - great food and atmosphere and a perfect patio for my dog. This week we head to \"our spot\" and the patio is blocked by a \"NO DOGS ALLOWED\" sign. I have a service dog and could have been seated anyhow. I chose to go elsewhere, because I prefer to stick to places that welcome us. No longer \"our spot\". Disappointed in the new policy - and a warning for those who see it listed as dog friendly on Yelp. It\\'s not.'], u'58.Circa Brewing': [u\"This is a modern and fun brewery I went to on a Saturday with friends. Not only was their Oktoberfest one of the best I've had, my friends enjoyed their flights of beers.\\n\\nI was hungry and had to try their pizza. I shared their lox pizza with one of my friends. It was smoky and tastey! I love lox so I wish there was a bit more of that on each slice.\\n\\nThe staff was great and they keep the place clean! Our bartender explained their special events to us and was funny. \\n\\nI'd recommend this place to anyone. I'll even travel from uptpwn Manhattan to go again.\", u\"I really enjoyed my dinner out at Circa Brewing.\\n\\nMy partner and I met at 7:00 PM on a Saturday night and they still had plenty of tables available (when we left at 8:30 PM there was a wait). We ordered two beers, two pizzas, and the Circa burger. This was a lot of food but no regrets.\\n\\nThere was a bit of a wait to get the food. We sipped our drinks and talked but I did notice that the wait seemed a little longer than I would have liked. We enjoyed the Belgian Wit ($7) and the Berliner Weisse ($7), both very light beers with great flavor. Neither of us were particularly in a strong mood to drink so both beers fit the bill for us.\\n\\nThe pizza came out first. We had ordered the Salumi ($18) and the '62 Hawaii ($18). The Salumi was delicious but I will admit that it lacked cheese. The dollops of mozz were sparse and while the meat was plentiful, I did wish there was a bit more cheese on the pizza. However, I LOVED the added Mohawk honey. Everything tastes amazing with hot honey. The '62 was delicious. The ham was *extremely* salty but paired beautifully with the grilled pineapple. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the flavors. The dough was soft and not-too-thin. My partner was slightly annoyed that some parts of the bottom were charred but i actually thought it added to the flavor.\\n\\nThe cheeseburger was delightful. Expensive, I believe it was $22 but cooked to perfection and teeming with juicy flavor. Also the rosemary fries were delicious! I was a little sad we had binged so much on pizza so I didn't have the stomach to fully enjoy the fries.\\n\\nI think there are some small kinks to be worked out at Circa but overall it's a beautiful, big space with great food and drink. I would definitely recommend it as a nice spot for a group or a date!\", u\"I left here doing a little happy dance because it is so nice to find a brewery with great beer and pizza, along with an amazing interior so close to home. Step into Circa and you do not feel like you are in NYC. The massive front doors lead into a multi level interior which houses their multiple brewing tanks. The bar wraps around in a u shape and the tables surrounding are mostly booth style. We decided to sit at the bar where I was delighted to find the most comfy green cushy bar seats i've ever sat in. In addition to beer Circa has a full bar, cocktail  menu and decent wine list. The beer menu during my visit had six in house brews, as well as six others on draft including Sixpoint and cider. \\nSince the Circa beers all sounded amazing I decided to go with a flight of four. The flight came out in a really cute wooden holder with a chalkboard front area to tell you what each pour was. \\nMy ranking of the four samples was: \\n1-Rotator IPA. -This is described as tropical,citrus, and bitter with big hop aroma. This beer was refreshing and bright with unfolding flavors long after you take a sip. The standout of Circa for me. \\n2-Pilsner-The pilsner was super drinkable and true to it's crisp malt description. A great beer. \\n3-New England IPA- Another fruity and citrus style beer but with a little kick. \\n4-Belgiam Wit- I didn't love this one. The rich hoppy funk taste was a bit overpowering for me. It's described as coriander, spicy citrus and fruity. Something about it just didn't work for me with the blend of flavors.  \\n\\nSince the pizza smelled so amazing we decided to order the Salumi which had hot soppresatta, tomato, smoked scarmoza, mozzarella, garlic, mohawk honey, & oregano. This tasted as good as it smelled. It packed all the elements of a perfect pizza into one slice and was both crispy and soft in a great way. The sweet honey in contrast to the spicy soppresatta was a knockout. \\n\\nThe bartenders were awesome and so was the overall experience and vibe of this place. I'm excited to have it in the area! Can't wait to come back and try more of the beers.\", u\"Much like my Yelp friend Matteo, I love pizza and I love beer, so I was very happy to find out about this place.   \\n\\nThe space is really large and laid out nicely so there are different little areas that give you different vibes from big and spacious to cozy and intimate.  The bar is well designed and the staff are friendly and fairly efficient.\\n\\nI had a Hawaiian pizza and it was delicious.   The only beer I tasted was the pilsner but it was a great example of one.   We had a beer club meetup here and everyone was very satisfied with their beers, food and service.  \\n\\nGreat addition to the neighborhood and close to the Jay St subway station so it was a quick trip to get home.  I'll be back.\", u'I love pizza and I love beer. Unfortunately it\\'s hard to find a place that serves great pizza and also has great beer: great pizzerie tend to have a mediocre beer menu, while breweries tend to serve small bites (if they serve any food at all).\\n\\nEnter Circa, a new brewery that also serves fantastic pizza, alongside a rather tantalizing food menu. The first impression when entering Circa is that this space is huuuge! 6,000 sq. foot of space with a long, curvaceous bar in front of the massive stainless steel tanks and fermenters, lots of seating space, an open kitchen with two wood-burning pizza oven and two open fire grills, AND a shuffleboard. The overall feel is \"fun industrial\".\\n\\nThe brewmaster is Danny Bruckert formerly of Sixpoint Brewery. The current beer selection has 12 tasty brews on the menu, ranging from pilsner and lager, to several IPAs, to Belgian ale, to gose. I tried the saison, gose, Belgian wit, and IPA. My favorite were the IPA (bitter and aromatic) and the saison (complex and acidic).\\n\\nOur dinner started with the goat\\'s milk ricotta ($13), which is served with fennel pollen and saba, and dough puff straight from the pizza oven. The ricotta is wonderfully light and creamy, and the saba[1] adds a sweet tone to it that I loved. the dough puff is nice and fluffy and quite addictive.\\n\\nFor pizza, we tried the Big Dipper and the Salumi. The Big Dipper (truffle bechamel, melted leeks, wild mushrooms, pork shank, gruyere, side of pork jus; $21) is a serious contender for pie of the year: I loved the combination of truffle oil, wild mushrooms, and pork shank, and the pork jus adds even more flavor to this fantastic pizza. Of the Salumi (hot soppresatta, tomato, smoked scarmoza, mozzarella, garlic, mohawk honey, oregano; $18) I loved how aromatic the fresh oregano smells, and the sweetness of the honey pairs wonderfully with the hot soppressata.\\n\\nIn short, a wonderful place: great to relax after work, for your next office party, or even for a casual date. It\\'s also great to see new places with exciting food options opening up in Downtown Brooklyn.\\n---------------------\\n[1] Grape must reduction. Here\\'s what Wikipedia says: \"Saba is an ancient condiment, known since the time of the Romans, and is the result of cooking selected grape musts, especially of Lambrusco or Trebbiano grapes, over fire. Saba is the main ingredient in the production of Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena.\"', u\"I really wanted to like Circa Brewing, I did. But they have a few problems they need to sort out.\\n\\nLet's start with the good:\\n-The space is beautiful. High ceilings. Big booths. Lots of tables, including sidewalk seating. They have a few projectors, but no screens (yet), so I imagine they'll start using those at a later date.\\n-The Big Dipper pizza was unique and great. Imagine a French dip, but instead of a steak sandwich, you get a pork pizza with pork jus on the side. Oh, and truffle sauce on top.\\n-The handicap stall in the men's room has its own sink and mirror, which is kinda cool, I guess.\\n\\nThe mediocre:\\n-There weren't any real stand outs with the beers. They may have had a problem with their carbonation system because the gose was flat and dull. Their IPA was also nothing special. They opened the place with 10 different styles of beer available, which is ambitious even for an established brewpub. Should've scaled it back and perfected a handful instead.\\n-Their beer menu lists the SRM color of the beer (which, really, who cares?), but doesn't list more basic/important things like IBU, or even quantity. For some reason, they serve their IPA in a 10 oz tulip glass.\\n-There's a really out of place shuffleboard table in the middle of the bar. Not sure who's supposed to be playing it, but it ended up being these kids at the table next to us while the rest of their family was done eating and not leaving (all the while, other people were clearly waiting for a table).\\n\\nThe meh:\\n-The Clam Down pie was incredibly salty. Almost unbearably so. And if you're expecting New Haven style pizza, don't be. Crust was just normal and a bit too doughy.\\n-Pizza prices go up to $22 on the high end, which is more than what you'd spend at a place that actually specializes in pizza, like Emily or Pizza Moto. Granted, the Big Dipper was good, but more of a gimmick than a staple. Also, adding truffles is basically cheating.\\n-It took forever to get our check, and then our waitress just kinda disappeared after handing us the bill. The waitstaff have tablets with card readers, so it should really be a much smoother process.\\n-The tables also had bottles of oil with whole red peppers floating in them, but it wasn't even a little spicy. Not sure what the point was.\\n\\nI'd probably return to give them another shot, but maybe not so soon. I've heard good things about their tomahawk steak (which is listed at market price, but our waitress told us MP is always $90, which is very curious).\", u'This place opened not too long ago so I really hope they read the reviews and make the necessary changes.\\n\\nBe ready for a long review. There\\'s so much to say from our experience...\\n\\nThis brewery in downtown BK is huge and the aesthetic is industrial and clean and simple. Makes you feel like you\\'re not in New York it\\'s that big. Upon entry the hostess was friendly and sat my friend and i right away at a round table in the back. Our server came by with 2 waters and 1 menu for 2 people. We asked for another water cup for a friend we were waiting on as well as another menu. He comes by awkwardly with the cup and no other menu. Upon hearing us ask each other where the other menu is he says he\\'ll be back with the menu. Ok. Cool.\\n\\nWhen telling us what beers they have available he lets us know the gray\\'ed out beers they don\\'t have. I ask what the flight situation is about. He proceeds to tell me that they are not doing flights although on the menu it clearly states that flights and growlers are available. Ok. Cool.\\n\\nWhile waiting we ask to try a few of the beers before we commit. (This is exactly why I wanted  flights btw. So that I could happily pay to try the beers). After a bit he brings the tasters over separately. It was as if he didn\\'t know how to hold them. \\n\\nAfter he stood around a couple feet from us awkwardly. It appeared as though he didn\\'t know wtf to do with himself or was so high he forgot how to be a server. Ok. Cool.\\n\\nAfter a bit of discussion the three of us decide to move to the bar to try our luck there. hah.\\n\\nTrish the bartender takes our orders. She tells me that the food will come out whichever comes first when asking her if the appetizers could come first. The beers are great, they get poured. We\\'re happy to have alcohol. She comes back and clarifies what we ordered because she doesn\\'t remember.\\n\\n1 pizza comes out. Then our beets as an app come out a little bit after. Then another pizza comes out. Then the last pizza comes out but it\\'s wrong. Like I said she came back to ask us our order. She does tell us that she\\'s sorry and that she thought we ordered something else. I appreciated that. Finally the other app the mac and cheese comes out. \\n\\nThe pizzas were super delicious. We had the margherita, the clam, and the salumi. The mac and cheese was good but when is it not good? The beets with endive were also good.\\n\\nAfter a couple rounds (where we had to flag Trish to order since she wasn\\'t attentive) and being ready to go with food left over we were given gigantic full size pizza boxes and huge bags for the 2-3 small slices we each had. Like what? We asked one of the bussers for smaller boxes and he was super friendly and came back very quickly. My friend asks another bartender for a bag. She says they don\\'t have them. We tell her we were given huge ones. We\\'re confused. Trish comes back and tells her they have bags but only the big ones. Ok. Cool.\\n\\nWe ask for the check. Trish gives it to us but without my friend\\'s credit card who put it down in the beginning because it was required. My friend asks for her card back. All 3 of us put our respective credit cards on the bill (1 of which is the credit card given back to my friend) while Trish is watching us. She proceeds to say to my friend \"that was the card I just gave back to you\". My friend explains to her that she just wanted to ensure everything wasn\\'t being charged on her card. I mean, especially given there no context from Trish there\\'s no wrong in asking for her card back. We say that and Trish had mad attitude. Thing is, it\\'s not up to her to decide how the customer wants to pay. Communicate to your customers so there is no misunderstanding. Communicate and don\\'t be rude. It\\'s simple.\\n\\nTo sum up:\\n- Besides the bussers who were very attentive with our waters and the to go boxes and the hostess in the front the service was downright awful. \\n- The menu had false advertisement (no flights. not sure about the growlers) with 3-4  unavailable beers. \\n- The food was great. \\n- The beers we had were great.\\n- They weren\\'t ready to open and they shouldn\\'t have until they had all their shit lined up.\\n- I will not be back for months and months to give it another chance. I hope that what needs improvement has in fact improved.', u\"This huge new spot just opened in Downtown Brooklyn, with a big focus obviously on drinks, but the food is also excellent.\\n\\nI just tried some of the pizzas and they were excellent. Both the simple Margherita ($16) and the Bitter End ($20) were delicious. I'll definitely be back for more food and the unique brunch pies on the weekend.\\n\\nAlready open for lunch, brunch and dinner, this is another great option in this area that is rapidly becoming a destination for food.\", u\"I'm soooooooo happy! I live in the building that Circa has recently opened in. This neighborhood has been lacking in food and drink options for years and within the last month suddenly numerous spots have popped up. Circa is a gorgeous restaurant and brewery that seats approx 250 people. We went on a Saturday night at 9:30 pm and the wait for a table was 30 minutes! So clearly they are doing well!\\n\\nTheir beer is awesome and the food even better. We started with the black rice grain bowl and then shared the Hawaiian pizza. This is some seriously good thin crust pizza. The items on the menu are unique and span from salads, cheese plates, etc to pizza and large entrees like chicken or fish. Everyone will find something they like on this menu. They play great music and the atmosphere is fun. Good service too. I can't wait for this to be my new weekly spot!\", u\"I don't drink beer, but my friend was very pleased with Circa's beer selection. Nothing on the cocktail menu tickled my fancy, so I opted for a cider. They have two dry craft ciders on the menu (Downeast and Nine Pin), which I was happy about. It's always nice to go somewhere that has something on the board other than Angry Orchard. \\n\\nWe snacked on fries, which were topped with parmesan cheese and fresh garlic. Some of the menu items seem overpriced ($9 fries, $15 mac and cheese) but the pizza looks and smells amazing. I definitely want to come back for dinner. \\n\\nLove the decor of this place! It's rustic, open and warm, spacious, yet intimate. Circa has a huge wrap-around bar and lots of indoor seating otherwise. They also have a small outside patio. The shuffle board table was a fun surprise. Staff is accommodating and friendly.\", u'Fun brew pub with great service, excellent beer, and delicious treats. Get a flight (4)  and then order your favorite brew. The lighting design is excellent with great decor.', u\"First, Circa apparently had divine inspiration when designing the interior because I didn't even know bar seats could be this comfortable. I will forever think of these seats as I sit at every other bar for the rest of my life.\\n\\nTucked away on a block you probably wouldn't expect, Circa opens up into a high-ceiling, industrial-chic brewery/bar/restaurant that instantly makes you feel at home and relaxed. I am a huge fan of their super-simple beer listing - the type/flavor in huge letters on the wall and the price. All too often breweries have a habit of writing their fun, but uninformative, beer names in tiny handwriting on chalkboards that you have to be standing against the bar to read.\\n\\nWhile we didn't eat, we had the stout, the peach, and the Belgian tripel, which were all pretty solid and priced (I think $6-8). These weren't anything super unique or off-the-wall, but the stout was one of the better I've had in a while (and it had a perfect pour!)\\n\\nThe table shuffleboard is also a fun addition and the TVs playing sports surprisingly did not detract from the atmosphere at all. Couple this with the nice, attentive staff, and it was a really nice afternoon at Circa. I'm interested to come back and try their pizza as it smelled pretty great.\", u\"I'm not a beer drinker but I am a notorious bar patron. I was pleased with this bar experience which was once a baron location for socializing with spirits. The establishment is large with lots of space to either walk in and find a spot at the bar or grabbing a table. The pizza is made with fresh ingredients and the environment is relaxed. Nice place to kick back.\", u\"What could possibly be a better combo than beer and pizza?  \\n\\nHow about fancy beer and gourmet pizza?! Add to that a clean, modern look that incorporates the industrial beauty of the brewing equipment with the quaint charm of a backyard patio* (with the comfort of air conditioning) and you have a recipe for a good, effing time!\\n\\nI found this location when looking for a location to host a company event.  Working with Sarah and Audrey was a pleasure - they were both very helpful, polite and quick to respond.  The restaurant is new so there were some small snares but nothing that they weren't willing to talk through!\\n\\nWe ended up getting a reserved space under the string lights which was nice and tucked away, allowing us to chat and enjoy our beer and pizza in relative privacy in the midst of a crowded restaurant.  The service was fantastic!  Our server Rachel was definitely overwhelmed by 30 thirsty people all showing up ordering drinks and food but she and her team quickly and calmly took care of all of us.  I know there was some confusion with drink delivery when everyone is mingling but nothing she couldn't fix!  (thanks everyone!)\\n\\nEveryone was really happy with both food, beer, cocktails, service, and the location!  Thanks, Circa for making me look like a hero!\\n\\nOther great things about Circa:\\n\\n- Shuffleboard table.  Perfect for those that want to do something active while holding a drink.\\n- Ventilation system.  You would never guess they had 2 raging wood-burning ovens and an open grill to make the delicious food with.  No lingering restaurant smell!\\n- On-premise brewing. You actually see where your beer is made!  The casks in the upper rafters of the brewing are an indication of the coming cask-aged beers in the future. Yippee!\\n- Location.  Close to trains but in an area that was in real need of some fun locations.  Glad to have this addition to the hood!\\n\\n--------\\n* There's also a gorgeous bar.  The blue bar seats are both comfortable and remind me of the interior of a restored classic car.  Good job, designer!\", u\"It's new.  Put it on you watch list.  It may have potential.\\n\\nStill some startup pains, e.g.:\\n\\n- the bus boys are more personable than the bartenders;\\n\\n - staff can be a little lazy about keeping the place clean and customer ready;\\n\\n - some dishes totally miss the mark - such as the pizza with a salad piled on it or the weird, Trumpian goop on the hamburgers.  Hopefully Circa works through those menu issues fast.\\n\\nIt garners an after-work crowd which could keep Circa afloat for a long time.  If that's the best they can realize then an opportunity will be missed.\\n\\nStay tuned...\", u'Awesome pizza! Love the sauce. \\nGreat happy hour deal!  Sweet attentive bar staff, will def be back.', u'Wow wow this bar is awesome if you pass by here sometime you have to stop on. Wow the beers made on location at the bar. It my first time here I love. This going to be my spot for the weekend from now on. Please check it out.', u\"Where to start! First off I would like to thank Yelp for even allowing me to find this place. Otherwise, don't think I would've ever found it. This place has been open for about a month now and it's on the rise! \\n\\nAfter being graciously welcomed by the host, we were seated at the bar (incredible comfy leather bar seat). We took in the elegant aesthetic of the place: brewer drums , massive storage kegs, taps, and growlers galore... wood grain finishes on the bar. Overall a really unique place. \\n\\nAs we browsed the menu we were greeted by our lovely bartender and ordered 2 unique flights of Circa-brewed beer. We tried them all. \\n\\nAfter the flights arrived, Danny, the head brewmaster popped out from behind the countless barrels, drums, and whirlpools to come introduce himself. This man was beyond friendly. He was informative, passionate, humble, and downright funny. Yo say we enjoyed learning from him is an understatement. He learned about the delicacy of his craft, the importance of freshness, and the joy that Circa gives him.\\n\\nAt the end of the experience: 1) I love supporting local places with passionate staff and founders 2) I'll pay up for an experience 3) I will come back again, very very thirsty for more. \\n\\nGood on you guys. CHEERS!\", u\"Decided to try a new place - cool atmosphere though a tad bit loud; huge place - they even have a game table (shuffle board I think). Staff - super friendly and nice! Drinks are good, good beer. Now the food on the other hand  sad to say - disappointing. Steak tartar was completely overwhelmed by the mustardy caper sauce (super salty), clams were nothing special, as was the sausage (had an odd flavor from one of the herbs), burger was ok - loved the fries (really the only thing); and the pizza ... I think it'd be ok if it wasn't so burned, that just kinda overwhelmed and overpowered the rest of the flavors. Oh and all of that - not that's cheap  Otherwise - great place to chill and have a few beers!\", u\"My friends invited me to a happy hour and dinner at this new brewery in Brooklyn after work. I had never heard of it before since it just opened a few weeks ago so I was very excited to check it out! Please see below for the pros and cons of my visit:\\n\\nPros: The space is large and the ambiance is very chill! I really loved the old-world feel and d\\xe9cor inside. \\n\\nThe happy hour special is a great deal! You get two free beers (don't get to choose them from the menu though) and a delicious margherita pizza for only $20! If you're not picky about your beers and pizza, this is a steal!\\n\\nI was happy to see there was a shuffleboard and played a few rounds with my friends! We had a great time!\\n\\nCons: When I requested a table for 5 people, they gave us a tiny booth in the back that is really meant for 4 people. It was really uncomfortable to be squished so close to each other so we requested another table.\\n\\nWe were not given a menu with the happy hour specials and our waitress never mentioned them to us. We only found out about the specials through my friend who had been there before. My other friend was a bit peeved that she had already ordered some drinks before she knew about the specials.\\n\\nThey seemed to be understaffed for a busy Friday night and our waitress was understandably flustered and short with us whenever she stopped by our table. \\n\\nOverall, this brewery is a great addition to the downtown Brooklyn scene and I am definitely adding it to my list of happy hour favorites!\"], u'103.Thaimee at McCarren': [u'Went here twice - once for dinner and once again for Brunch.\\nThe food is fantastic, bursting with flavor. The chef Hong Thaimee is a very sweet person. She came out to our table to chat with us, and took us for a tour of her kitchen.\\n\\nTheir color changing noodles kick ass!', u'Those looking for traditional or \"authentic\" Thai cuisine shouldn\\'t come to Thaimee at McCarren. But for those who appreciate the flavors and taste of Thai food and are seeking something truly unique in the culinary landscape - come to Thaimee at McCarren.\\n\\nFans of Ngam should be familiar with Chef Hong Thaimee, who hails from the city of Changmai in Thailand. She\\'s taken the cuisine of her homeland and fused it seamlessly with her experiences working the fine dining kitchens of NYC (including JGV\\'s Perry Street and Spice Kitchen) to create a menu that\\'s true to her - \"True Thai\". Every dish is crafted with care and purpose, but there are some definite stand outs I\\'d recommend for those curious to make a first visit.\\n\\nThe Pad Thai Carbonara, for instance, takes the beloved Thai street noodle and fuses it with thick dices of pork belly and an egg yolk to add on the signature Italian pasta flair. It makes the noodle dish just a little more decadent and hearty - and that much harder to share. The gorgeous \"Magic Noodles\" are definitely a must-order as well; these thin, blue vermicelli noodles will turn a bright purple with just a squeeze of lime. Sure, it does well for the realm of Instagram and social media, but take one bite of the flavor-packed acidic, sweet, and slightly spicy noodles, and you\\'ll fall in love with them as well.\\n\\nI can\\'t wait to come back to try the rest of the menu, including the gorgeous Fish cooked in Bamboo, as well as the decadent-sounding chocolate souffle. It\\'s a unique and beautiful space that\\'s just what the Williamsburg neighborhood is looking for.', u\"This was my first time coming to a restaurant within its first week of opening. My friend and I were greeted so nicely and presented with glasses of prosecco. It was very light and dry, one of my favorite glasses of prosecco. \\n\\nWe ordered the magic noodle salad, beef green curry, fish in bamboo, and thai tea affogato. \\n\\nThe magic noodle salad was full of citrus and refreshing! As seen in pictures, the noodles do change from blue to purple with the acidity of the lemon juice! It gets lighter and lighter with time. Shrimp is a great additive to the salad. \\n\\nThe beef green curry was full of subtle flavor. The beef was so tender, it just falls apart and the curry is flavorful with a taste of coconut. \\n\\nThe fish in bamboo comes in slices of fish and then covered in a tom yum like broth from the bamboo holder. The fish is soft and tender as well and the flavor is so subtle, it hits right after you've consumed the fish. The broth is great, almost having a two for one, soup and fish. It was a light tom yum flavor that wasn't sour or spicy. \\n\\nLast, the dessert was served as vanilla ice cream in a glass then was topped with thai tea. It wasn't too sweet, just how I like it! \\n\\nUltimately, we were fortunate enough to have another dessert with the chef, the chocolate chili souffle! It was wrapped in what I believe was banana or bamboo leaf. It was soft and the inside oozed of chocolate. It was paired with a plum sake. Great pairing! The plum sake wasn't heavy and the plum favor was boastful. The souffle wasn't on the sweet side either. Desserts were just the perfect amount of sweet here.\\n\\nThe chef and partner were so accommodating and welcoming. I can't wait to come back again!\", u\"Great service, great chef, great food.  If you like thaimee box in the ev, or thai, or just good food, you must come here.  Everything about this place over exceeds expectations.  Visually pleasing atmosphere, as well as food.  Open kitchen, Large bar, lots of seats and well lit.  Make sure to come by for dinner (iveonly been earlier and can't wait to be back). Insta worthy food and neon lights.  Employees and chef thaimee are beyond amazing: highly recommend. Get the color changing noodles, but don't pass up the ricotta toast and chicken Sammie.  Can't wait to be back trying the pad Thai and dumplings. Go here!!!!\", u\"We came to Thaimee at McCarren for brunch just one week after they opened in the McCarren Hotel. The room was light and airy - a nice change from the previous place.  \\n\\nWe ordered the magic noodle salad, fish in bamboo, creme br\\xfbl\\xe9e french toast and dessert. \\n\\nThe magic noodle salad was fun to watch - the noodles really do turn purple - and actually tasted delicious. The noodles are light and the lime juice gives it a nice acidty. \\n\\nThe fish in bamboo is three big slices of red snapper, served in a tom yum broth from the bamboo tube. The broth is full flavored - but not too much for the fish. The bamboo adds hints of wood and nut.\\n\\nThe french toast is less Thai - but still fun. The brioche bread is baked with brown sugar, giving it a good crunch. Jasmine whipped cream is a nice distinctive touch. \\n\\nWe also tasted two of the cocktails from the new menu. The boulevardier is whiskey driven, with a nice balance of sweet and bitter. The Chiang Mai Buck is refreshing and gingery. \\n\\nThe staff was welcoming and knowledgeable. I can't wait to come back!\", u\"I really wanted to love this place bc there aren't many quality Asian restaurans in the Burg. The staff was very nice and attentative. The layout is beautiful. We ordered the Magic Salad but we didn't really see the color change (maybe the lighting but not a big deal). The salad was a bit salty for my taste. We ordered the dumplings, which we really liked. \\n\\nFor our main course we ordered the $52 chicken. I was hoping at this price I was going to get something special but it was dry and bland. \\n\\nI'm hoping it was just an off night or bc they are a new restaurant (2 weeks). I'm def coming back in one month bc I want to see them succeed. Good luck\"], u'42.Peaches': [u'One of my favorite places that I visited during my recent trip to New York! This place is just chill af and has a great playlist and, most importantly, great food! \\nWe stopped in for lunch on a Sunday and I got the oven baked grits, which includes braised short rib and a heaping arugula salad on the side. The grits are really smooth and rich and the short rib was amazing as well. \\nService was great, and although the waiting for a table bit is a bit confusing, we had a great time at Peaches overall.', u\"Came here on the Sunday prior to Labor day with a friend of mine. We even saw a couple of other friends dining there as well. \\n\\nWhen we arrived there at 1:35, we were told the waiting time was about 20 to 30 minutes. During this time, we put our names down and I decided to walk to the location on Tompkins avenue to see if they had any availability as well.\\n\\nBy the time we got back, I asked the hostess if our table was ready. It hasn't been 20 or 30 minutes yet and she said that she called my name but that we weren't there. So I am already upset, hungry and tired. We had to wait another 15 minutes before we could even get a table. I almost got into it with another hostess/server because of the weird attitudes. My friend is telling me to relax and not worry. So I do, but then by that time, we are given a table.\\n\\nSo the table we get is wobbly and keeps moving. The furniture is old and outdated. The restaurant is small and you get barely any privacy. The music selection was good, but the closeness of the tables turned me off.\\n\\nSo, our waiter comes and asks us what we want for our appetizer. My friend initially ordered the smoked chicken and sausage gumbo. I ordered it too. She changed hers to the Brooklyn wings 2.0. We shared out appetizers just to get a taste of it. The wings were overcooked. The gumbo was actually really, really good. Hell, it was the best part of brunch. The cheddar cheese grits were good.\\n\\nI ordered the Brownstone punch and my friend ordered a glass of Riesling. The drink was okay, I can't really remember it so I know it wasn't all of that to me. My friend received a complimentary glass of Chardonnay. It was nice.\\n\\nSo I ordered the Jim Cade breakfast. It came with French toast, scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage and some berries. I chose the bacon and ordered a side of chorizo and cornbread. My friend ordered the Smoked salmon plate. The salmon was pretty good. My dish was good to an extent. I don't like my bacon fried hard like that. The French toast was excellent might I add. Very good for whole grain too. The scrambled eggs were good and I ordered it to be cooked with cheese. The chorizo waa okay, my friend ate most of it. The berries...not a fan of fruit on my food but I let my homegirl keep it.\\n\\nMy biggest issue with their brunch selection was that it was so limited. Brunch is supposed to be a portmanteau of breakfast and lunch. The menu consisted of mostly breakfast options and we didn't get to start eating until 2:30 in the afternoon. I think they should work on that. The appetizers are a little bit too high for their price. The entrees were actually pretty affordable so that is no issue.\\n\\nThe waiter brought the take away plates to us. One thing I dislike is having to put my food in the take away plate myself. Whenever I go to other restaurants, the waiter does it for me so I don't have to be at my table doing it in front of other patrons. \\n\\nWould I dine again? I don't know for sure if I will. My friend loves the place. Me...well, I think there are some better options without all of the other stuff that goes along with it.\", u\"This place is OK. While I give big points for the superb artichoke spinach dip and the consistently on point playlist (think rap and R&B hits of the last 10 years), the slow service and mediocre entrees (or at least my entree) makes Peaches 3 stars for me. While I understand Saturday nights are busy, 45 minutes felt way too long to wait for blackened chicken and a shrimp po' boy. I loved the decor and the energy of Peaches - it was bustling by 7pm - but the service got so slow that we had to ask the waiter to check in on our dishes. (I rarely do that.) But arrived they did.\\n\\nNow for the food. As an appetizer, the artichoke spinach dip *is* excellent. Creamy and rich with flavor, the dip pairs beautifully with the crispy and well-seasoned tortilla chips. And the cornbread is...fine. A little too dry for my tastes, but it'll do the trick.\\n\\nThe entrees...now that's more of a mixed bag. My friend's blackened chicken was very good. I particularly enjoyed the tangy, in house BBQ sauce they used to douse the meat. My shrimp po' boy, meanwhile, was a bit of a mess, literally and figuratively. The fried shrimp themselves were delicious: crispy, but not dried out, and a perfect vehicle for the remoulade sauce. The coleslaw served on the side was also quite good, creamy but not bland. And that's where the good ended. The fries were a little soggy and bland - think bowling alley fries. At *best* nothing special. And the hoagie they use for the po' boy is SO huge, that it overwhelms the shrimp, lettuce, and tomato. I know that po' boys are supposed to be messy, but the sandwich felt like a loaf of bread featuring shrimp, not a shrimp sandwich.\\n\\nThe mediocrity of some of the dishes, put together with the slow service, makes this place only A-OK for me.\", u\"I will definitely be coming back to this spot! Great food and service and right around the corner from my bestie's. I love the ambiance and it is bright and sunny inside.  The staff was so friendly and accommodating and the food was fresh. As a vegetarian, I really appreciated the flexibility to sub in meat substitutions.  We ordered a variety of things including Jim Cade breakfast, Mac n cheese, grits, fries, and grits over short rib.  I don't even really like grits and the grits were on point! Everyone enjoyed their food! \\n\\nBe sure to grab some desert; the French toast peach cobbler was delicious!\", u'After researching various brunch spots in Brooklyn area I saw that Peaches had great reviews. I was intrigued by the comfortable yet chic atmosphere that appeared in the pictures. And, thankfully, the place lived up to its expectation. The service was excellent, and the food was delicious.  I order their breakfast special which came with scrambled eggs, French toast, choice of meat fried potatoes or grits. I got both and glad I did. The potatoes were excellent but the grits were not good at all. I should have known better than to grits up north lol. My aunt ordered their salmon cakes that was also very tasty and fresh. In all, great spot and look forward to going there again.', u\"After falling in love with the fried chicken at the peaches on Tompkins I figured I would check out this location. Sadly they do not have the fried chicken here. I had the Jim Cade platter with eggs, French toast, bacon and home fries. The French toast was a bit dry but the bacon was very thick and overall the food was delicious. I ate outside which has long picnic style tables and you will be seated with strangers at the long table. \\nInside is very small and the vibe is very slow and casual. We weren't greeted when we walked in so we just chose a place to sit. We had to wait quite a while for service although there weren't that many people there. So don't come starving and don't come expecting grade A service. \\nI liked the food but missed the fried chicken so I think I will go back to the other location.\", u\"I'm just going to jump right in and get to it. The grits with the wine sauce, mushroom with shrimps are to die for. I think the best I've had so far. The grits were rich and creamy and the shrimps were well done. To top it off I also had the cream spinach and that too was right on the money. Price is reasonable and service is excellent and fast \\nGreat experience ...very crowded but that explained it after I was done eating . Will definitely be back to try something else\", u\"It was July 4th and was in the mood for a burger and fries. I'm pretty sure they're known for other stuff on the menu, but I gots to go with my personal craving :) Got myself a medium rare burger with blue cheese, fries, broccoli on the side, and a glass of Malbec to enjoy my meal with. Cheese is extra, you can opt for a salad if you don't want fries for no extra cost. \\nI got my craving fulfilled, burger was a perfect medium rare, no complain on the fries and broccoli. Staff were also very friendly as well.\\nAn overall very pleasing dinner. \\nDon't just believe what you're reading, go experience it yourself is my say. Cheers!\", u\"The variety of food for brunch was great. From salads to short ribs it was perfection. Most meals come with a side of grits or potatoes. I'm not a grits fan so I got the potatoes which were great. \\n\\nA friend of mine got the black kale salad which she said was great despite it seeming like a weird combination. \\n\\nI got the smoked salmon scrambled eggs which was probably the safest option. I was traveling later that day and didn't want to chance my stomach getting upset. \\n\\nThe service was slow but friendly. \\n\\nThey also have 2 locations so when we got there the first was packed but they walked us right over to the other one and we sat right away.\", u\"The food was delicious. I would definitely start with the wings and the spinach artichoke dip. Everyone loved both of those. Someone I was with didn't like the gumbo. I got the shrimp and grits, it was just ok, I've had better. \\nBut I tasted everyone else's food. The flounder was great and the ribs were tasty. I'd hold on the collard greens. Not much flavor. The service was outstanding. Food came fast and very friendly. They even gave my brother chocolate cake and icecream for his birthday!\", u\"I would give 0 stars if I could. I misplaced a gift bag in there. I called the restaurant to see if they had it and a young man reported that they had it. I tell him that I'm going to return in the morning to pick it up. I call the next day to let them know that I'm coming to pick it up and no one knows what I'm talking about. They tell me to call back in a couple of hours so the appropriate staff can assist me. I call back and still no one knows what I'm talking about. I decided to get up and go anyway. The staff ignores me and then proceeds to give me the run around blaming people and then telling me the manager is too busy to see me. Then the manager comes up and basically has no constructive information. Staff claims to have it and now no one claims to know what I'm talking about? Sounds like untrustworthy staff to me. Never again.\", u'My aunt brought me here for brunch. It was my first time going here and I chose to get the smoked salmon scrambled eggs with white toast and white cheddar grits. Everything tasted amazing! But just beware that if its your first time know that they have a band play at certain times so the atmosphere can go from loud to very loud.', u\"I came here with friends for dinner and drinks. The atmosphere was nice. I ordered the blackened catfish and grits. It was tasty, however, it could've used a little more salt or seasonings. The brownstone punch from their cocktail list was delicious! Service was pretty quick and staff friendly.\", u'Peaches gives you the ambiance of southern Georgia meets gentrified Brooklyn. Definitely the brunch spot for hipsters and locals alike in Bedstuy. \\n\\nI arrived at 11:30 for breakfast and seats were already packed. Luckily, we were able to grab a table for 2 near the back of the restaurant. I really love the southern ambiance of this restaurant. Very quaint and cozy. Dark wood and earth tones. The bar is placed as a focal point of the room towards the entrance. \\n\\nOur waiter Vick was a sweetheart. Very well spoken, attractive and polite. He served with southern hospitality. I ordered the Jim Cade. Granola encrusted challah French toast with seasonal berries, scrambled eggs, bacon and Cheesy grits. The granola French toast was comparable to crumb cake. Impeccable. The meal was very light. No overbearing feeling of gluttony following my meal. The salt and sugar content was perfection. I paired my meal with a Peaches punch which was a mixture of cranberry, pineapple and orange juice. \\nMy meal was well portioned and delicious.', u\"What a wonderful neighborhood gem and an authentic ode to the South. The food is consistently delicious, drinks are strong, and the music selection is on point especially if you like old school soul and jazz. It's a win win guys! \\n\\nMy favorites....\\n\\nDrink - The Brooklyner. Enough said. Just drink. It's the best!!!\\n\\nStarter - Brooklyn Wings, sweet and spicy BBQ wings drizzled blue cheese dressing and sliced scallions. The skin isn't too soggy or crispy. It's just right.\\n\\nEntree - It's a toss up between the shrimp and grits and Salmon. The shrimp and grits entree is served in a cast iron skillet. The grits are creamy topped with tender saut\\xe9ed shrimp. It's orgasmic. Really!!! Now on to the salmon. It's garnished with artichoke, spinach and olives. This salmon is so moist and flaky. You're last bite will leave you wanting more. \\n\\nSides - Hands own get the Macaroni and Cheese. It's reminiscent of grandma's home style cooking. None of that butter substitute or vegan cheese. This is the real deal so don't count your calories. Just dig in and run around the block a few extra times to burn off the yumminess!\", u\"Unfortunately the restaurant side was packed and the wait was too long for my stomach to bear so we headed down to the bar side which is literally 15 steps away. \\n\\nWe walked into the small dimly lit bar venue straight to the bar where there were two seats waiting for us to be seated in . (There's also regular seating, about 4-5 tables) \\n\\nThe bartender was just okay. You can tell he was too busy to be social or friendly so he took our order and kept it moving. I had the catfish and grits which was absolutely amazing!!! I've been eating grits all my life and I can let you all know. They have perfected them. I didnt add a grain of salt. The catfish was seasoned perfectly and went well with those little tomatoes. My boyfriend had the hamburger bc he's allergic to seafood (sucks for him) but the burger and the fries were also good (because I eat his food too). \\n\\nOh and the d&b music selection?! They should probably make it a karaoke dinner because everyone including us was singing along...and out loud!\", u\"The food was really good. However, be prepared to spend some time here. We sat at the bar and hoping for a faster service. We waited for 30 min for our brunch plate. Also I was quick disappointed that there's no fried chicken on the brunch menu.\\nAlso definitely make a reservation if you plan to come for brunch, it's very crowded...\", u'Best Brunch I\\'ve had for the year! So many things to say about Peaches. After feeling pecking for brunch a friend and I decided to go here. Between us both we have ate hear atleast 3 times for dinner. We arrived around 12 pm on a Sunday and this definitely was not a good time to arrive. The waiting area was filled with people but we still decided to put or names down especially when they told us a 25 minute wait. That seems like a reasonable wait time for Brooklyn brunch on a Sunday right? The joke was on us as we waited 45 mins to be seated while the waiting area continued to pack up with more guests. At one point in time people were elbow to elbow, cheek to cheek. I mumbled to the stranger beside me saying \" this has to be a fire hazard \". \\n\\nWith this said I gave them 4 stars because of the food. Waiting 45 mins, we knew what we wanted and got our drinks and food order as soon as we sat and abracadabra it was piping hot and at our tables about 5 mins later. I was totally flabbergasted! The serving staff is on point at this place, these guys were hustling back and forth from the kitchen with speed making sure the food came out asap. The eggs were the best and even though I\\'ve never been a fan of grist in the past, I am now fond of this weird porridge. Grits were hot, creamy and cheesy. The granola crusted French toast was a sweet treat. The Jim cade breakfast is almost like two meals in one and seems to be the fan favorite. If you go here for brunch it\\'s a definite must. I would say this is my new go to brunch spot.\\n\\nMy one suggestion to peaches is try to work on the wait time and don\\'t tell everyone it\\'s a 25 minute wait when it\\'s not. The wait is apparently not holding anyone back from dining here. The service is fast but it seems like the biggest setback for them is space.', u\"Food generally tastes great.. there's definitely a few favs on the menu. The wait staff could look a little more put together..kinda sloppy looking.\", u\"Loved the vibe in here! Great music, not too loud, just right for date night. \\n\\nCute little find with a cool but casual crowd. Full service bar, great menu selection. Go here if you're ready for some awesome soul food!\\n\\nI had the crab cakes which were so good and larger than usual. I was only able to finish one and shared the other. Shoe string fries were perfect and spicy sauce was a deliciosos way to bring it all together. My date had the salmon with lemon pepper sauce. It was perfectly cooked! This place knows sauces!!! \\n\\nGet the brownie dessert! Warm and fudgy! Can't go wrong!\"], u'48.Ruammit Thai': [u\"Came here opening day with a friend -- it was fantastic legit, fresh, and delicious. Had the Laab (minced chicken salad-y dish), which was almost too spicy but too good not to work for it; the roast chicken (forget the name) which was falling-off-the-bone delicious, and the red curry, which was, y'know, thai curry, but on the delicious, fresh end of the spectrum.\\n\\nNormal Thai restaurant prices, good service, nice decor and all that.\\n\\nWill be back soon :)\", u\"I was excited to notice a newish Thai place on Nostrand avenue, so I decided to call ahead for pickup of what I like to refer as the intro Thai meal or the Thai restaurant gauge. I ordered chicken pad Thai figuring I'd test the restaurant out with this standard before venturing into other items on the menu for subsequent visits. \\n\\nThe call-in process was simple and the lady that took my order was nice enough. The pickup process was rather seamless as my order was waiting when I arrived. It took the cashier a while to ring it up, but hey, I get it, technology will fail you sometimes. The price was appropriate. \\n\\nThe problem was the taste. I've never had flavorless Thai food. Seriously bland. I thought I was being overly judgmental, so I asked my 2 friends to taste it. Same reaction. They quickly offered soy sauce that they had in the cabinet to help revive it. \\n\\nHopefully this was an off day, but I can't see myself going back.\", u'So excited to have a Thai place open here. I wish them the best of luck! My friend and I had the red curry with shrimp and the pad thai with chicken. Both were delicious and super fresh, I\\'d happily have either again. (Though the serving of rice with the curry was really, really small.) \\n\\nMy only challenge is that I have celiac, so am allergic to gluten. (Serious health issue. Not a \"lifestyle\" choice.)  I had to explain to the super-busy server that I can\\'t have soy sauce, flour, wheat - which always makes me nervous. I was pretty sure I could have curry, but she made the effort and checked with the kitchen, but I LOVE it when restaurants are confident about what I can or cannot have, what can be modified, etc. I can relax, enjoy my meal and know I will not get sick vs. just hope for the best. I live nearby and love Thai food, and regularly patronize places that can accommodate gluten-free, so encourage them to train staff or note food allergies on the menu. (gluten, veg, dairy, etc.) \\n\\nI\\'ll definitely be back. Great food! The pad thai alone will make me a regular, I just love other options.', u\"Hurrah! A Thai restaurant finally entered the neighborhood! It's not within walking distance of my house, but at least now I have a Thai restaurant in a neighborhood that I regularly go to.\\n\\nThe restaurant is small, but tidy and they place little touches to make it homier. \\n\\nMy husband and I ordered the pad mee keow and pad see ew. The pad mee keow was spicy just the way he likes it. We both loved the fresh Chinese broccoli in our dishes. The noodles were a tad overcooked. This is something easily remedied and it seems as if the owner reads every review and responds positively to feedback (so kudos!).\\n\\nWelcome to the Crown Heights! We'll be back for another meal.\", u\"Just opened today and so glad to have a good Thai place on Nostrand! Tried the pad thai, pad see ew, and red curry, and we all thought they were delicious. My pad thai had green beans in it, which I'd never seen before but really enjoyed. Also got free Thai iced teas for their grand opening. \\n\\nNice, simple decor that I'm sure they'll continue to develop. Clearly family-owned, and the whole family was hanging around the restaurant which made it feel very homey. The chef also came out and checked that we all liked our food. Cash only for now.\", u'This place just opened and my friend wanted to try it out. As usual we were craving some delicious food. So we each ordered our own meals and then one to share. My favorite dish is pad see ew and then my friend and I shared the pineapple fried rice.  Also, once I saw Thai tea on the menu I had to order it!', u'Food is fantastic and every dish great flavor. We ordered the spring rolls, Tom yum soup, mixed seafood app, pad see ew, and spicy red curry with pork. Definitely a place we will return.', u\"With so many restaurants to choose from in New York, it is very difficult to find a great authentic restaurant. This is a cozy, warm place that is great for a quiet night out. The staff is friendly, warm and Very accommodating. Kudos to the Chef! The food was AMAZING! Great Taste and everything was so fresh. We ordered several dishes, each with its own unique taste and flavor. It's also very affordable since it's BYOB. This is my new favorite Thai Restaurant.\", u\"This place was so good we came back the next day and got the exact same thing! Spring rolls, white rice and Pad Kee Mao with pork was a spiritual experience. So rich in flavor, perfectly tender wide noodles. The second time i got the Pad Kee Mao, the chef (thank you!) must have switched up ingredients because it was even better! This is a thai food must and reminded me so much of my mother's cooking. I will definitely be going here every time i'm in New York City!\", u\"This place is absolutely amazing. Everything is made fresh so it takes a while to get your food, but it's worth it. My son had the wings appetizer and Chicken Pad Thai, and raved about it. I had the spring rolls and the fried snapper. OMG the fish was soooo good. I devoured it!\", u'We have finally found our neighborhood Thai place! After trying nearly every place in the area, we were so happy to discover Ruammit. We have eaten in the restaurant several times, and wish they delivered! The pad see ew hits the spot and everything else we have tasted was fab!', u\"New thai restaurant on Nostrand ave and since Brooklyn is the new up and coming hit commodity had to check this place out.\\n\\nNice cozy ambiance, menu had a decent variety. It's BYOB as well.\\n\\nMy friend and I ordered the spring rolls and i had the green curry really flavourful, not salty, good portions. \\n\\nMenu pricing really reasonable.\\n\\nWhy I won't give it 5 stars my host wasn't very attentative and messed up the payments for the bill.\\n\\nOverall, I will return.\", u\"We got take out and it was very good, almost perfect. The freshness and crispness of the ingredients, especially the vegetables, was the most impressive aspect of the meal. The service was fast and friendly. What we got: The som tum was perfect, really fresh and refreshing. Spicy, as it should be. Spring rolls were super crispy and well balanced. Pad ruammit was also fresh and well prepared, with a delicious variety of vegetables, but it was a little too salty for me, though I suspect it is supposed to be. Can't wait to try more of the dishes. \\n\\nUpdate Aug 25: tried it again and was even happier.  Had the old favorites again and they were just as good, so the kitchen is consistent. Added two new dishes. First, the Moo Ping, which had a great char and the sauce was incredibly tart, hot and sweet. Second, the pad thai, which managed to be light and spicy; I tend to avoid ordering pad Thai because the sauce is often heavy and gloopy, but this was the exact opposite. It may have been the best pad Thai I've ever tasted.\", u'This is a great place for some tasty Thai food! We tried the chicken wings, pad thai, and fried sole. There wings were great, very hot and juicy! Pad thai was spot on. The sole was nice and flaky with excellent flavor. Would definitely recommend!', u'This place rules. Authentic flavors and fresh meat and veggies. Colorful and lovely presentation. Hefty portions too. And go ahead and order the mango sticky rice at the end because it is perfect.', u\"Really good Thai food. Nice service for take out, haven't eaten in yet. Good portion sizes and flavors and very fresh ingredients. The crispy wings are amazing. Have had the tom kha soup, pad kee mao and pad Thai as well, all GREAT.\", u'Found this Thai spot in Brooklyn and it was delicious.  Very authentic flavors and taste.  Got the house special - the whole red snapper - and devoured it!  Highly recommend this place for true Thai flavors and cuisine.', u\"This friendly local thai place serves delicious and very authentic food, and is very reasonably priced. The seafood glass noodle salad was to die for. It's bring your own booze as far as we could tell.\", u'Seriously authentic and yummy Thai food!! Everything I ordered had an abundance of ingredients, glass noodles with seafood was spicy but a very revitalizing spicy. Green curry was a beautiful green color too. Really hope this place hires a delivery person soon!', u\"Came for dinner with a few friends on Sat.  The service was good and everyone is really nice.  I tend to avoid Thai restaurants as I feel that most of them are underwhelming, but not here.  The flavors are bold (spicy, sour, and salty in a good way) which is what you want.  Everything we ordered was delicious and fresh.  The favorite of the night would have to be the wings (we went through one order and decided that we needed 2 more).\\nI can't wait to come back and try more things from their menu.\"], u'202.Colonia Verde': [u\"The bartender is a lovely, lovely man! Our food was taking a while (to be expected during Sunday brunch) so he gave us free drinks. Then, while making someone else the same cocktail he made for me, he poured more into my glass. Kudos to him. The cocktail was top notch, btw.\\n\\nThe food was delicious. I got the chile quiles, with duck, which were delicious, though I wish there were more sauce. The duck was perfect, though. I was envious of what my friends ordered so I tried several entrees and all were great.\\n\\nNote -- we sat at the bar because there weren't available tables when we arrived. Again, this is to be expected during brunch and we didn't have a reservation. We were just glad to be able to dine here regardless.\", u\"Colonia Verde was a pleasant restaurant experience overall.  \\n\\nWe sat out in the back patio area which was attractive.  \\n\\nService was polite and fairly efficient.\\n\\nThe food was good although not a place I'd come rushing back to.  I'm not a big steak person and most of the menu seems to be red meat/steak.  However they did have some items I enjoyed, including the salmon tostadas, the octopus, and the trout main.  The octopus was the standout dish- very flavorful and well done.\", u\"I've been living in Ft Greene for four years now and I finally felt compelled to take out my dusty and barely used review-pen to praise what has become my favorite venue in the neighborhood. I love taking friends and family here as it provides a very non-cheezy and tasteful Pan Latin cuisine experience.\\n\\nThe staff is wonderful and very generous! Everyone is always eager to brighten up your day and provide you with the best service possible. Even when it gets busy the servers are always attentive.\\n\\nThe restaurant is extremely pleasant. The owners have successfully pulled the right balance of feeling upscale and homey; It feels special without feeling over the top. This is a place where locals take their friends for a cool night out, or parents and special visitors during the day. The backyard and green house are gorgeous and romantic!!\\n\\nA lot of restaurants pull great dining experiences but Colonia Verde's menu is very peculiar because it actually has staples that I always crave and bring me back to the restaurant. With that said I have been living in New York for over ten years and I can count with one hand the number of places I've been more than 25+ times. This is one of them.\\n\\n1- My favorite item on the menu is the burger! I don't believe it's possible to ever claim a place can have the best meat/burger, but you can make a case for originality. The Pan de Queijo+Yuca Cheese bread (Gluten Free) really adds a great element to the burger as well as the pesto sauce. As a side you get sweet potato fries with a chipotle sauce (perfect kick) that pairs perfectly.\\n\\n2-The duck chilaquiles are another great plate. Personally I prefer to have it with the cheese (ricotta?) instead of the egg. Again an original dish from other chilaquiles you'll have around the city.\\n\\n3- Duck Tacos Are delicious!\\n\\n4- One of my favorite Chicken Dishes (available at night)\\n\\nGo try this place out if you haven't!! After enjoying their service, food and venue for years I finally felt obligated to write them a much earned 5 Star review!!\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: Beautiful Venue, Try the Burger and Chilaquiles, Been here more than 25+ times\", u'I had Pulpo al Pastor (grilled octopus, pineapple, charred onions, and cilantro coulis).  It was really delicious.  My friend got the pork belly appetizer. To me it was just hard, inedible little chunks. I would have returned it.  The heirloom tomato salad was good, but at the end of summer, I expect tastier tomatoes.  The \"earthly delights\" salad (farmer\\'s cheese, fennel, cucumbers, tomatillo & ming) is 90% cucumbers.\\nColonia Verde has outdoor seating in the back and a lovely glass-ceiling room, in addition to a front room.', u'Felt a bit unsure about trying this place but glad to say that we didn\\'t leave disappointed.  The atmosphere is nice and while we opted to sit inside, the outside sitting area looks very spacious and comfortable.  Love their high stool chairs - they\\'re basically shaped to fit your bottom haha so you don\\'t get tired of fidgeting while trying to find a comfy spot waiting for your food.  Of note, waiting we did; while the staff are very friendly, the service is just a bit spotty - no rush, no rush at all (eye roll). \\nLove the shrimp tacos - my favorite part about them is that I actually tasted the shrimp!! Very flavorful dish, everything is well balanced and you really get to taste the \"meat\" of it all.  The duck confit chilaquiles was delicious - also great flavors.  The burger was the least favorite for me but hey, the person who actually ordered it - enjoy it.  The one complaint was that while he ordered it medium, well done would have probably worked better - just the way it would all come together (and not fall apart haha) in every bite.  The fries though were the bomb!', u'One of the best restaurants in Fort Greene! Delicious food, surprising drinks and great atmosphere! Highly recommended :)', u\"Got there right when they opened. I really didn't know what to order because everything was new and a little strange to me. What do you do when you look on the menu and see Brussel sprouts with shaved cheese and a poached egg on top? You order that Sh*t!!!!!!!! Can I tell you it was amazing. It was truly a party all in my mouth. The one that shocked me was the coffee. It was surprisingly good. I would have been happy if it was just ok. Oh yeah, I also had a Quesadilla too. \\n\\nDon't think about it, just go!!!!!!! Next time I am in Brooklyn, I will be there.\", u\"I've been here a few time and never had a bad experience. Food and drinks are good. Cool spot for a date or meeting up with friends.\", u'The shrimp tacos were to die for as was the parrillada! Loved the cute outdoor seating area in the back, takes you away to another place.', u\"The three stars are mostly for the ambiance.  The food was really just OK.  I looked forward to having the picanha as I'd heard much about this particular cut but was sorely disappointed.  It's really just a sirloin cap and while properly cooked to a medium rate was quite tough.  And the $33 price for 10 oz (maybe) was insult to injury.  Another guest had the hanger steak that proved to be the better option at half the price.  The waitress promoted the appetizers as shareable but when they arrived, we laughed.  The mushrooms (at $12) barely filled half a cup.  The pee wee potatoes were flavorless little balls that desperately needed the accompanying aioli to give them any life.  The octopus was good and fairly generous in size.\", u'Great space and backyard! Had brunch and got the burger with sweet potato fries. Food was good, would be curious to try to non-brunch menu.', u\"My go to summer brunch destination in the area. The design and ambiance reminds me of patio Sunday lunches with family. Shrimp tacos top my list for food, they're well balanced, not too rich yet hearty enough to fill you up. Prices are on the high side for the portion sizes when I compare to other restaurants in the area and would appreciate more optionality in the menu but otherwise good bet for good food in Fort Greene.\", u'Just finished brunch.  We sat in the back room- lots of light and very lovely! We arrived at 12:30 and was surprised to find the place almost empty.  \\n\\nThe food:  \\nDuck confit - amazing!  Order this.\\nCv burger - this was ok. \\n\\nAlso very nice pot of tea.', u\"Decent place but not a lot of love coming  with service.  Every time you ask a question or ask for something  you feel like you're bothering them.\", u\"The food was amazing but the service sucked. A bit pricey but the food was good. The waiters just don't pay attention. I'll probably come again.\", u'Came here with my parents to celebrate my Mom\\'s birthday. Overall, a very disappointing experience.\\n\\n1 star for beautiful outdoor dining and 1 star for some decent food.\\n\\nHere is a list of all of the issues:\\n-When we arrived, we were taken to a table outside. While we were happy to eat outside, it was odd that we weren\\'t asked if we had a preference.\\n-Very small list of wines by the glass. Only two reds and neither one was a standard choice. My Mom got one and I got the other. Mine was fine and hers was less than fine.\\n-Duck confit tacos were described on the menu as having pickled onions, cilantro, and yuca chips. None of these things were in the tacos. Instead, there was avocado. The duck itself was very tasty. But it\\'s a pet peeve of mine to list something on the menu and then not include everything that is listed in the description. I very much like pickled onions and don\\'t know why they weren\\'t there. If you\\'ve changed the preparation, then change the menu. Or have the waiter tell us that the preparation has changed.\\n-My Dad\\'s steak was overcooked.\\n-We ordered two sides and they didn\\'t come out when our entrees come out. We had to ask for them and they didn\\'t arrive until we were halfway through our meals.\\n-Trout had no flavor. The menu described an aji amarillo sauce, yet there was no sauce anywhere on the plate. The sunchoke puree was good but where was the sauce?\\n-Waiter was fairly absent. He never came to ask us how everything was. We barely got an apology about the sides not being served.\\n-We ordered coffee with dessert. When they were brought out, we were told they were americanos. I have no problem with americanos but when we ordered coffee, we should have at least been told they don\\'t have coffee but they serve americanos instead. What if I didn\\'t want an americano? It tasted good but that\\'s not the point.\\n-Two americanos were brought out with only one spoon. We had to ask for a second one.\\n-Churros were actually donuts, not churros. Very tasty, but not churros. We realized afterwords that it said \"churros gringos\" but there was no description. If you\\'re going to have churros that aren\\'t really churros, please have an English description that says what they are.\\n\\nI know a lot of these things may sound petty but they add up to a very mediocre dining experience. So yeah, I won\\'t be coming back here.', u'THERE IS A PROBLEM HERE...\\n\\nMOODY STAFF walked around and around our table refilling glass water jugs and not paying attention to us when we first arrived for at least 10 minutes at dinner. Once we got a server to come over he seemed upset about it. We asked him what he liked on the menu to which he said, \"The whole left side is pretty good,\" without looking at us in our faces. \\n\\nThe food was MEH. It was SUPER OVERPRICED for what it was and MEAGER. We had the duck tacos (not tacos more rollups, soggy, incorrect), chicken and skirt steak (WAYYYY TOOOO SMALL). Separate sides of carrots and potatoes. Neither nothing to talk about. I woke up in the middle of the night after REGRETTING that I had spent that much $$$ there. I WISH it could have been somewhere else. \\n\\nNY HAS SO MANY RESTAURANTS TO GO TO. SKIP THIS ONE. XOXO', u\"I really hope today's service was a fluke. Maybe willing to come back in the far future because food was promising. At the end of the day, they have tough competition on the street that beat my unfortunate experience today. \\n\\nHanger steak and eggs: \\nGood: the meat was flavored well, the two sauces packed heat and everybody loves a good fried egg with rice. \\nProblems: asked for medium rare, the ends maybe passed as medium and the center was definitely well done. Eggs were inconsistent as one egg was runny and the other was cooked. Ya know, unless they want me to experience the range of how an egg can be cooked in one meal.\\n\\nDrinks:\\nOrdered a cold brew and mint limeade once we sat down. Received the mint limeade halfway through the meal, and cold brew 3/4 of the way through. We actually ordered two cold brews and they ran out so we only received one... They said the bartender was backed up. \\n\\nI'm unsure what was going on, but the lack of communication was apparent. \\n\\nSuch a shame because the food was flavored well and the location/ambiance is inviting, sunny and airy.\\n\\nThey also take reservations for brunch, which is always a plus!\", u'The brunch menu is very limited. We had the Brussels sprouts which was nice and the CV burger which was okay. The $21 huevos divorciados was a disaster and took the time it took for my fellow diner to receive his food and finish it and wait another 10 minutes before mine arrived, not cooked to my specifications. Overpriced and not worth a visit in my opinion.\\nThis place is non descript from the outside. It looks like a store about to close down but the inside is surprise back garden and a quaint but sparsely decorated interior.', u\"A little Ft Greene goodness right here.  Cozy, good vibe, attentive service, small, but filling dishes. I'd come back for sure. The octopus and corn salad were both right on.\"], u'179.Werkstatt': [u\"One of my favorite spots.\\nThis place got it all right, the space, the atmosphere, the service and the food.\\n\\nThe interior is intimate at the front and more beer garden feel in the back, so a bit for everyone.\\n\\nThe drinks here are great, with my favorite being the Werkstatt (Grapefruit beer and sparkling rose)\\n\\nThe food:\\nAll the apps here are great, so you can't go wrong with any but the favs are\\n-Pretzel, really is the best in NY and is huge\\n-Mussels, great dish to share, well seasoned\\n-Champignons, perfectly fried mushrooms\\n\\nWhile I love all the main dishes i have tried here, i still go back to the Wiener Schnitzel every time, its just the perfect comfort dish.\\n\\nDesserts are also good, can't name them but the times i have been here i tried to switch it up\\n\\nOverall the perfect spot to add to your weekly rotation.\\n\\nNote: Cash or Amex only if i remember correctly.\", u\"Everything about this place takes me back home. My mum has Hungarian roots so the food I grew up with was all Schnitzel, goulash, chicken soup etc.\\n\\nI have passed by Werkstatt so many times with the intentions of going in but have yet to find people to come with me. Finally, I pulled some friends with me and put my foot down. We're going to Werkstatt!\\n\\nSo we walk in and honestly, all bars look the same, but this one just felt like it was more European pub style. I was loving it. We were seated right away with menus and water right after. \\n\\nOur waitress (Forgot her name but she's been there since they opened) was super attentive, nice and helpful with our decision of what to order.\\nWe settled with ordering some cocktails, wine, and for food we got the Chicken Soup, Chicken Liver Mousse, Goulash, Salmon, Side of Veggies and Side of Roasted Potatoes. For dessert we ordered Apple Strudel and another dessert, I forgot the name but it was great. \\n\\nThe chicken soup was so hearty and flavourful, I almost thought I was eating my mums homemade soup. The Chicken Liver Mousse was something else, almost like a dessert, so tasty and sweet. The goulash, omg the goulash! You must must get the goulash if you are here for dinner. The meat was top notch, absolutely phenomenal and instead of potatoes they used spatzel which gave it this awesome twist yet still incredible. Ah! Just thinking of it I want to run back and get some more. \\n\\nThe fish honestly reminded me of my mums salmon, it was so similarly cooked. Beautiful flavors in the spices they used to cook it in. Perfectly cooked at a medium temperature. I know I'm raving about this food, but honestly guys, this is what great food should be like. Not a single dish was left over or had any crumbs left on the plate. \\n\\nI really enjoyed the dinner we had here and honestly can't wait to come back for more. Especially now that I'm 45% fluent in German :p Really guys. This is a must go to on your bucket list.\", u\"Not for vegetarians. As someone who doesn't eat meat and is not a big fan of potatoes, werkstatt was very disappointing in the options they offered. \\n\\nThe waitstaff were very nice and my family loved what they got, which is why I gave them 3 stars, but as a vegetarian, there was very little on the menu I could eat.\", u\"This is mine and my hubby's favorite Austrian restaurant and quite possibly our favorite restaurant period. The food, the service, the beer, everything is top of the line here! We eat out a lot and have found so many fantastic places, but this place is honestly amazing. They have different daily specials every day of the week, plus additional specials. No matter what you order you can't go wrong, but try the crisped mushroom and the salmon, or if you see a pork shoulder special entree go for that! Dessert isn't bad either ;) The owners are super sweet, so attentive and always up for a chat, and the rest of the staff is fabulous as well. I cannot say enough good things about Werkstatt. I only wish we lived closer so we could visit more often!\", u\"Absolutely delicious.  I'm of German decent and grew up with German food but this is the best I've ever eaten.  We had the pork with sauerkraut.  It was incredible.  I love this place.  We'll return for sure.  The ambiance is great.  Decor is inviting and relaxing.  Nice lighting to make it feel intimate.  Yet, we had a great chat with other people at the bar which is where we chose to sit.  (Bar is very comfortable.)  They have many tables as well and the restaurant is long and narrow with two separate sections so it always feels intimate even if there are lots of people.  Very lovely layout.  Friendly staff.  Owner is super cool.   Highly recommend.\", u'Had brunch here a few weeks ago with another couple and their baby. The staff was very friendly and helpful, even with the baby there, and the food came out super quickly, like amazingly quickly. \\n\\nWe got the green eggs (with no ham), chicken schnitzel, pastrami hash with creamed spinach, and a side of spaetzle with cheese. The creamed spinach that came with several dishes was less creamy than regular American creamed spinach and felt less decadent/more like a vegetable. It was still very good. Pastrami hash was ranked as \"tasty\" by my boo, who ate it all up. The spaetzle was delicious in its buttered noodle goodness. The grapefruit breakfast beer was refreshing, too! \\n\\nNone of the dishes hardcore blew us away, but it was a lovely, tasty, brunch on a Sunday morning with no wait, friendly service, and a nice, casual ambiance.', u\"*Cash or Amex only*\\n\\nI've never had Austrian food before but hello Werkstatt, you've made me a convert and want to eat Austrian brunch every single day.\\n\\nI came with a friend on Sunday for brunch. It was fairly empty and definitely a place where you can sit down and hold a comfortable conversation. The location is more residential/quiet than most and has an old America kind of vibe. I ordered the green eggs and ham while my friend ordered the French toast (stuffed apricot- sounds amazing already)! Now, this was no Dr. Seuss moment but it was darn fantastic. For $15, you get complimentary ice coffee, your entree of choice, and an oj/libation of choice. I like creamed spinach but I LOVE Viennese creamed spinach. There's just an extra elevation of creaminess and heartiness. \\n\\nBroken yolk + ham + r\\xf6sti potatoes + creamed spinach = breakfast bliss\\n\\nFor quality and value, Werkstatt is definitely one of the top brunch contenders in Brooklyn. I can't wait to come back to take a stab at their dinner and other brunch options!\", u\"Works every time! A great neighborhood restaurant. It's hard to decide what to order because I can't eat all the dishes I crave. This visit we ordered a variety pack and shared. We had their amazing Pretzel, the brussels sprouts, a butternut squash soup that was on special and  their chicken snitzle along with a few glasses of their wine on draft.\\n\\nEverything was comforting filling and delicious. The butternut squash soup was not standard and what we were expecting but was well spiced and has good texture because of the house made croutons. Their pretzel is one of the best I've ever had--soft and salty served with a tasty aioli. The snitzle was classic served with a light salad and is very satisfying. \\n\\nI'll be back soon!\", u\"I really enjoyed both of my experiences here. The food is quality and the prices are ok. The first time, I got a burger and substituted some the their salads for fries - I recommend the cucumber salad. My partner is a lover of sp\\xe4tzle - he enjoyed it but noted it was even more cheesy than he had hoped (maybe a tad too much).\\n\\nSecond time around I got mussels as an entree with a side of bread for dipping. The portion was delicious and definitely large enough for a meal, though the bread was not a great pairing with the mussels. I'll take credit for that though because they don't necessarily mean for you to eat the two together. This time my partner got an awesome beer + chicken combo and loved it. \\n\\nBeer and atmosphere are also top notch. I recommend the back area.\", u\"The best Austrian/German food in Brooklyn. Consistantly great food, quick service, great beer and other drinks , awesome specials, brunch - everything these guys do is great. Hope they're gonna stay here for a while, it's really a gem in our parts of BK.\", u'I really wanted to love this place. My friends have been here a few times, and I heard great things. I was excited to accompany them finally. I like the casual rustic feel with the glass bottle lights, and motorcycle overhead. The grapefruit beer I had was nice. I started with the appetizers. The chicken liver mousse was divine, and I thought I was in for a wonderful meal. The mussels were also very good. It all went downhill from here. I ordered something off the specials - crab. While I know how big a crab is, I expected more than 2 small ones for a $22 dish. It was ok. Nothing out of the ordinary. The side of broccoli rabe was very bland and a pile of green mush, and so were the potatoes. The potatoes were boiled and had zero spice. Hello.. even some salt and pepper would suffice. I was very disappointed.', u'++++\\n- I give 4 stars just because they have green eggs and ham\\n\\n+++\\n- Nice and empty on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm\\n- Chicken snitzel and sides were perfect complements\\n\\n++\\n- Awesome service\\n- the brunch apps are the size of meals themselves\\n  *My arugula salad was huuuuuuuuge\\n\\n+\\n- I expected more from the apple strudel\\n- The wife enjoyed the brussels sprouts. I hate brussels sprouts, so I cannot eat them\\n  *I do not like them sam I am\\n\\nTIP:\\n- hot sauce is hottt (insert fire emoji)', u'Feeling my Austrian roots & so is NYC w/ the opening of Freud & Schilling. Werkstatt is the real deal w/ an Austrian chef at the helm. Brunch is a treat.\\nAte: \\nMatzoh ball soup\\nGreen eggs & ham\\nRose\\nTotal $25\\nThe corner spot on CIA is super charming. I\\'m surprised it wasn\\'t more crowded at brunch, but the rain might have kept the \"carriage crowd\" at bay. The matzoh ball soup was simple, w/ a fine broth & very satisfying. The green & eggs & ham are a riff, with creamy spinach & Rosti potatoes. The housemade hot sauce is out of bounds Zehr gut!', u'Terrific place on Coney island Ave. We ordered the Pretzel.. Wow  it was great!!\\nthe Goulash was very good, and so was the burger! service was great as well.', u\"The food at this place is always delicious. I've frequented Werkstatt a handful of times in the last few months, and I have never been disappointed in the least. I've come for brunch and dinner and I can't even tell you which was better. Neither was better because the food at this place is always delicious. Oh, I'm sorry did I say that already?\\n\\nWhat should you order from here? Probably one of each or 2 of each if you're with a friend. Don't get me wrong, portions are filling, but since you'll be sitting so long trying to decide on your dish, you may as well just try it all. Every choice is a good choice. The flavors, the textures, the atmosphere and the ambiance is all spot on. \\n\\nI also had my last birthday here which was about 3 months ago. I reserved the long table in the back by the fireplace. The waitress we had was very attentive without hovering. She had a smile on the whole time, even when I bugged her to take some pictures of our group. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. \\n\\nIs it possible this place gets better? Well it does. As some of you know, I know nothing about alcohol except that it makes me feel all funny inside. I typically don't like the taste of anything with alcohol unless I can't taste the alcohol. But if it's time for brunch and you're in the mood for a Bloody Mary, you need to try this one. Not only do I like the taste of it, you may even find me drinking 1/3 of it. (Seriously though, a drink of alcohol to me means tilting the glass so that it drips on my lip and then licking my lip. Me and alcohol.....we just don't understand each other.\\n\\nIn conclusion, eat here. You will not be sorry.\", u'Good burger.  Comes with an arugula salad and a potato like crepe.  Friend bartender and open space on Sunday. Will probably be back for their other menu items', u\"I loved my Matzos meatballs 'cause they were HUGE and so tender I'd order it again. And brussles sprouts my friend had were crisp to perfection. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and this place works just right for a calm Thursday European-style dinner.\", u\"An absolute gem just south of Prospect Park. I've been there a few times and have enjoyed each and every one has been terrific. Salad selection (cucumber potato and beet) with Schnitzel is terrific. I had the special pork chop tonight which was definitely a top 5 of any I've had in my life. \\n\\nGreat authentic beer selection, a nice ambient bar, terrific art and vibe makes this place somewhere you'll absolutely love.\", u'Authentic, honest food, and great quality ingredients!\\n\\nThe meat for my gulash was like butter, with a \"light\" homemade spaetzle. \\nDont miss the desserts, especially if there\\'s the Topfen special. The Apple Strudel is a hit, which we brought home to eat the next day.\\n\\nGreat hospitality (the owners were walking around the restaurant speaking with customers) and make sure you sit at the back room.\\n\\nHighly recommend!', u\"LOVE the decor and atmosphere with this place. They do a really great job of transporting you to Austria. Definitely feels authentic and the food is, well; delicious.\\n\\nCame on a sunday. they have a brunch deal for $15 which comes with a cocktail (i had a generous glass of bloody mary, they also have grapefruit beer!), coffee and a breakfast entree. I had the green eggs and ham. the boyfriend had a sausage and egg dish. But, of course, we over ordered and ALSO got a GIANT PRETZEL AND BRUSSEL SPROUTS. \\n\\ndo yourself a favor and get the brussel sprouts. it's delicious. i can eat 3 bowls of it. \\n\\nthe brunch dishes were all solid, but the brussel sprouts stood out for sure. i'll be back to try other items! (Schnitzel, bratwurst and goulash spaetzle)\"], u'92.Hot Space': [u\"Very very nice fish place. I am a fish lover and I have been searching for fish place all over NYC. The best one I have had was in Shanghai about four years ago and I miss it so much... Finally I find this place from friend's recommendation and am so glad.\\n\\nWe come in a party of 5 and order two fish, each with several sides chosen. I like the two flavors both - spicy and sour&spicy. Among the sides, I love seaweed (my all-time favorite so no doubt no matter how they cook), lotus root, potato slice(a must have), and wood ear fungus.\\n\\nThe price is very reasonable too, about $30 per person. The drink tastes good. Better than most Chinese restaurants offer. They will open another restaurant in flushing, which I will keep an eye on and definitely will visit once it's open.\", u\"The food was amazing.\\n\\nIf you want that China, fish on the pan/grill experience, come here. The frog platter we ordered was a lot and very good. The pieces were big pieces also. The sea bass was delicious.\\n\\nThe staff here are very nice, attentive, and always smiling. \\n\\nMy experience here for a new customer was just amazing. Definitely coming back. \\n\\nA little pricey but that shouldn't be an issue for the taste of the food.\", u'This place was recommended by a friend who worked on the 8th Ave. The service was very good. The grilled fish was by far the best I have had in NYC. Hope they can maintain their good service and food quality.', u'Very nice service, it will blow your mind if you ALWAYS get attitude from Chinatown people.', u\"I have came this place more than five times, so finally I decided to write a review for then. I am not a spicy person first of all. So I brought my family here for black pepper oysters sauce fish, that's the flavor they recommend for us. The fish was huge, we thought we wouldn't even finish the whole thing.     But, at the end, we finished the whole fish with extra more vegetables. I had black pepper oysters sauce for two times. and then, me and my friends love their spicy bullfrog pot.  That's the flover  make me feel very addictive. Once I had it, I will miss their spicy bullfrog pot.  I definitely recommend this place. Five stars.\", u\"This place was just fine. The ambience is great and the servings are pretty but definitely on the smaller side for the appetizers. I felt rushed even though I wasn't the one placing the order, my sister was. Might have also been because we had went on Christmas and the lines were outrageous for a small place. The music was also very very obnoxiously loud. We were a table of 10 but they had sat us down that fit a table of 6 and just added additional tables and chairs but still felt cramped and uncomfortable as I think we were literally elbowing each other for food. We did get spicy seaweed on the house though for certain inconveniences. \\n\\nWe got two different kind of grilled fish, one spicy, one as sour cabbage for the kids so they can have some. We tried many different side dishes as well, but like I had mentioned previously, the price for the  appetizers were expensive:small ratio. \\n\\nThe spicy fish was actually delicious and so was the sour cabbage fish. They paired well with rice but also had a lot of bones floating around. Though, as we had gotten to the end the soup was starting to disappear and so our vegetables were starting to stick to the grill, they should be checking up on our grill often, possibly add some water when they see it evaporating. The spice was on point but I had to chug two glasses of water for how spicy it was. \\n\\nI would not go to call this authentic Sichuan food as I have had much better and really authentic. This is more like a mixture of cultures. I can also taste the amount of msg they add because after the dinner I was definitely parched.\\n\\nWould I return? Possibly if someone else was treating because in my opinion, the prices are quite expensive and there are definitely more affordable and authentic sichuan places around. They also need to be able to arrange seating better so a big group of people would not need to feel cramped.\", u\"Loved the quaint space. A great date night spot. I had the grill fish in a lip numbing, spicy broth. Awesome sauce times 10. I'm addicted to the dried pumpkin seeds and fava bean snacks. My Kumquat lemon Ice tea was refreshing. To finish I was offered a herbal jello . Something very new to me but nice. Will come back for my next fish craving.\", u'This place is a nice little spicy surprise. Portions of fish are to be shared so going it alone I had to try some side dishes. So yummy and spicy. The staff was especially nice.', u'I went here on a Sunday night, so it was particularly busy. The manager gave us an assorted nut appetizer while we were waiting(we were sitting at a table). He then preceded to place our orders ahead of time so when we were seated, our food came out right away. Every server was very very nice and one even went out of her way to take the corn off the skewer and poke in chopsticks instead. The manager also gave us an in the house duck appetizer. The food was amazing! Definitely fantastic service that I have never seen before. Can not tell you how pleased I was!', u\"It's the first time I am trying this restaurant, was thinking of trying some good spicy food but it's full of disappointment. Got the spicy fish but the fish is not fresh at all, it's very fishy even the spice can not cover the smell. The appetizer is not good too, we ordered the shredded potato and it's the worst one I've ever had so far. Only the fried rice is acceptable but not the best. The pricing over here is way over priced. Will consider coming back here a 2nd time. Btw, the service here is good that's what I think it worth the 1 star.\", u\"Best grilled fish! THE authentic fish I finally found after two yeas search! I hope I live closer to this place. And the karaoke...well I don't like it but for the fish it's all worth it\\uff01\\uff01\\uff01\", u\"The reason I give five star is all because of their service. They have excellent service! The food I had tonight was Mala tofu fish, the waitress said the mala tofu flavor is their most popular one. It was spicy, and it was good spicy. I love it.  And their four pounds fish is perfect for group of four people, it was not that fishy because of the strong flavor.  But if you can not handle the spicy. They have other flavors also. A very small tip for you guys, cAuse of it comes like a pot, so you want to eat slowly. Don't burn your lips or tongue. I definitely recommend this fish place. I will come back try some other flavors.\", u'Shared the MaLa tofu seabass with sides (enoki mushroom, lotus root, kelp, potato) and it was delicious! The portion size is probably enough for 3-4 depending on how hungry you are- so its a good deal for the amount of food you get. Wonderful, warm service and cheap beer. Highly recommend!', u\"I came here around 3pm with my bf because I saw the ad. I like there was a huge screen that played music and TV. Everything was good, I like the atmosphere, food was delicious, staffs were friendly. And we also got a free spicy seaweed appetizer from manager. I only gave four stars because when I came home heat up my leftover for dinner, I saw there was a sticker on one piece of red pepper. \\n   I brought my friends for dinner a week later, we ordered rice cake with fish, half of the rice cake was so hard and stick together. We got another new order instead. Overall, it's a nice place to have a dinner with friends.\", u'One would not expect to find a restaurant like  Hot Space  near sunset park area. The chef knows his spice and the kitchen turns out some spicy and tasty dishes. A welcoming space and a kind staff complement the great cuisine.', u\"Amazing service and delicious food!!!!!!!! Never expect service like that around 8th Ave lol.  I got the tofu fish.  The fish is so good!!!!!! And the waiter kept asking us if we need anything. \\nBTW, I got enterotritis the day after. Nothing happened on the friend who ate the fish with me. Think that was probably my problem????? idk. But if you DON'T have strong stomach,definitely try something that's NOT SPICY. \\nI will definitely go back again lol great place for a dinner.\", u\"I love this place! Nice dinning environment, yummy foods and drinks, especially the hot pot fish! I personally like more spicy, but if you cannot tolerate the spice, you can ask for mild. Friendly customer service also make this a comfortable place to hang out with your family and friends! Don't wait guys! I 100% recommend this place! I will definitely go again when I go to Brooklyn next time! :)\", u'I paid 70 dollars for a fish dish that in the end left me hungry. There was about 2 bites worth of meat in total and a whole bunch of tofu and vegetables to cover up the fact that there was no fish underneath. \\n\\nFlavor is good but in the end I ordered a tofu dish, not a fish dish. Dont go here unless you are a fan of getting ripped off.', u'Went here with some friends last night. We got the largemouth bass fish, it was delicious and our server Tina was awesome. She was one of the most accommodating server I had in a while.\\nHowever, the price here is quite expensive thought. I can understand the need to make money but at least balance it out with cheap drinks or free rice or something.\\nIt is just kind of hard to justify coming back for a second time when you thinking about spending $70 on a 3lb fish.', u'The food was so delicious here. Came here friday night at around 8 and was pretty quiet'], u'165.Positano Restaurant': [u\"This place never disappoints.  I'll keep it simple; sit outside, try a new dish every time and have a conversation with the friendly staff.  \\n\\nI'm 8 visits in and I have a new favorite meal every time.\", u\"Hosted a bridal shower here this weekend in the bigger private room for a group of 22. Such a cute place.. the striped blue and white awning, the brick walls inside the room, wine display.. very classy. Was the perfect place for a shower. Loved that they put all of us on one giant table versus two long tables or smaller tables - made it easier to interact as a group, especially for our shower games. They set up some tables by the window for us to put our cake, guest book, favors, and for guests to put their gifts. We were able to hang our bridal shower sign by slipping the rope over two of the wine bottles. \\n\\nVery happy with the food. For appetizers -- we shared mozzarella caprese, meatballs, and eggplant siliciana (eggplant with an orange-infused cheese thing -- really good). For the main course, guests were able to choose between veal marsala, chicken francese, penne vodka, rigatoni bolognese, and eggplant parm. I chose the penne vodka but lots of people around me got the rigatoni bolognese. My dish looked kind of bare compared to theirs since mine didn't have any meat, but the sauce was really good and some of the rigatoni people preferred my dish to theirs.\\n\\nThe dessert (chef's assortment) was amazing. The waffles were my favorite but the donuts and lobster tails were really good too. \\n\\nService was fantastic. Vale(sp?) was friendly, attentive, helpful, and hilarious. The rest of the staff were great as well. \\n\\nOnly complaint were the 1-2 flies that kept hanging out at our table during the beginning of the meal! Tough to avoid when you have the door open (and an open patio area), so not sure what the solution would be.\\n\\nIn any case, gorgeous venue (the bride-to-be loved it), good food, and good service! \\n\\nWill have to return with the hubby :)\", u\"Love Love Love.  Had a fabulous time with my friends. Delicious food. Great service. Mattia is the best host. I highly recommend this restaurant. You won't be disappointed. \\nI have the daily special for fish and oysters as an appetizer. Delicious!  My companions had pasta. They thoroughly enjoyed their meals  \\nI will definitely return.\", u\"We went on a Wednesday evening about 6pm.\\nThey have outdoor and indoor seating. The inside is very boutique-chic. The waiter, waitstaff and I guess host? Were kind and attentive. The food was delicious!!! They give complimentary bread with caponata. We had the meatballs and baked clams to start. The meatballs were light and tasty. My husband got the bucatini and it had the perfect smokey flavor. I ordered the papardelle bolognese, probably the best I've had in the states. For dessert we had the apple crisp it was flavor but thought it could've been warmer. It's not a quiet date spot but I'm from Brooklyn so that's normal for me lol I would definitely recommend, we will definitely be returning. Afterward, go for a walk by the Verrazano so romantic.\", u\"For starters,\\n\\nthe outdoor breeze feels amazing when seated outside. This is an upscale, noisy restaurant, which Is what I like anyway so that is not a complaint :) The servers were very friendly & attentive! that's a Plus :D (Who doesn't love good service)\\n\\nThe food: It was kind of mediocre for my taste buds.The Baked clams were really tiny as to what I'm normally used to. (But they were tasty overall) \\nThe seafood salad we got was not something I'd eat again, I honestly prefer the taste of Ceviche. I really don't like to complain or sound picky because I love food but it just wasn't the greatest. The Penne alla vodka was a-okay as well, Penne was a bit too hard for me, but the sauce & shrimps were good.\\n\\nMy guess is, I probably didn't order the right things. Should've stuck to the basic Chicken Parm. I DO wanna come back though, just to try other things & maybe I'll love it then.\", u\"The food is very expensive and it doesn't taste very good. I spent $20 for 5 pieces of pasta that was nasty. Never again will I eat there.\", u'Decided to come to this restaurant due to the amount of people they had in the restaurant. Me and my boyfriend decided to try it. They had a special that day which was the porterhouse steak and decided to go with that. There porterhouse steak special was delicious! It was cooked perfectly at medium rare and it was soo soft that you can cut it like butter. It also came with sides too with the steak, crabmeat mac n cheese and creamy spinach. Everything was amazing!', u\"What a beautiful place with wonderful service! We got seated right away and our waiter was very polite. We ordered fettuccini alfredo with chicken and I had chicken Marsala. The chicken Marsala was juicy and made just right! This is the best chicken Marsala I've ever had. It's located right by the Verrazano bridge so we took a nice walk after. I highly recommend this place 5 stars!\", u'I came to Positano and had a lovely dinner. I was with a large group so I was able to sample various things on the menu. \\n\\nAmbiance: The ambiance was very nice. They played music which gave off a fun and vibrant vibe. Management and the wait staff were extremely attentive and friendly. I have absolutely no complaints about the service and in fact I was actually pretty impressed.\\n\\nFor appetizers we started with the Calamari Arriabiata & the Calamari Fritti. Both were delicious but my favorite of the two was the Calamari Arriabiata, which was a blend of sweet and sour flavor. \\n\\nEntrees:\\nMaine Lobster Ravioli: This was my dish and I absolutely loved it. I am a big fan of lobster ravioli and I thought that this was fantastic.\\nSalmone Dijonaisse: The salmon was a bit on the dry side but nonethless not bad.\\nSpaghetti Frank Sinatra: nice pasta dish\\nFettuccine Alfredo w/ Grilled Chicken: good pasta dish. Notably I  liked the Alfredo sauce.\\nLast but not least the special of the day which was a seafood blend of mussels, clams, shrimp, lobster and calamari over a bed of pasta. Again the lobster was good. Mussels, clams and shrimp were good but the calamari was lacking which was surprising considering that the appetizers were so good.\\n\\nOverall this was a nice experience I recommend trying it at least once. I can not emphasis enough how friendly the service was!!!', u\"I had the butternut squash ravioli and it was absolutely delicious. My friend had the lobster ravioli and it was so rich and creamy. \\nI feel like they are overpriced though. The decor is nice but for the quantity on the plate, it's costly. \\nThe service was good, they were friendly and attentive.\", u'Love the ambience and decor. This is the first Italian place in Brooklyn that I have really enjoyed. Most of the places I have been to around here are over hyped. I had a great time here\\n\\nThe olive bread was fantastic. Great taste. Full of olives. My sandwich was very tasty and had a good texture. \\n\\nThe one reason why I can\\'t give a five is because of the meatballs. I particularly thought they had a good flavor but the sauce was slightly too acidic and tangy. The big reason was the meatballs were burnt. They had a lot of charred blacked burnt edges. Too much for me. My meatball rating would have to be \"Restaurant- Serviceable.\" This is a solid rating, Check my profile for full meatball scale.  However, for me to give a five at an Italian restaurant, the meatballs need to have a higher rating. \\n\\nKeep in mind, we are still talking about a four here. I will be returning.', u'After reading the reviews i came to see what all the hype was about. The atmosphere and ambiance of the restaurant were great. It had a very warm environment and also a full bar. \\n\\nWe ordered nonnas meatballs first. They were over-seared on the outside and had a burnt crust. The inside was filled with cheese so it definitely was different but not necessarily my favorite due to the burnt crust. \\n\\nThe red sauce was ok but was a little bland for my taste.\\n\\nI also ordered the proscuitto sandwich with mozz basil and tomato. The sandwich was a little salty so i asked for some balsamic vinegar to cut the salty taste. Once i added vinegar the sandwich was delicious. \\n\\nThe bread was the highlight of the meal. Both the bread for the table as well as the sandwich bread were on point.\\n\\nIs this place 4.5 stars... no... would i come back... yes!', u\"I decided to eat lunch at this most talked about restaurant in Bay Ridge. I ordered the fried calamari which was delicious and then ordered gnocchi with pesto genovese, not bad at all. Once I received my bill, I was charged an outrageous amount of $32 for the gnocchi. I was told by the waiter that it was homemade and that is what management charges. Oh really? Well, management must think I'm off the boat and I don't know my prices! You made a jackass out of me once but never will I eat at your restaurant again! I don't give two shits if Jesus Christ was there for dinner. Dovresti vergognarvi di voi stessi! Mai piu!!!\", u'Food absolutely excellent. I felt like eating light so I had the finocchio salad & the burrata, both were superb.  What made the meal even better was the wonderful service we had from our server Denise. So pleasant & professional. A true pleasure. I will request to sit at her table in the future.  All in all, a great dining experience. So happy we came tonight', u\"I had a very pleasant experience at this place. It's one of the true remaining Italian restaurants in the bay ridge area of Brooklyn. This place also gets flooded with locals which is nice, but some crowds do get rowdy the later you stay up. This place is on the expensive side so prepare to open your wallet if you want drinks apps and an entree. They have a good selection of beer and wine. But this place shines with its traditional Italian menu! Be sure to start off with some fresh fish which you'll be sure to find here! For the appetizers we went with amazing crab cakes and some mozzarella bread. The crab cakes were phenomal and taste as good as the crab cakes in Maryland. The meat is packed nicely without much or any additional filler. For the entree I went with the nightly special with was a gnocchi with a short rib! The gnocchi was very fresh and was made with cheese as opposed to the potatoe. Across the table was the fra diavlo which was out of this world! I highly recommend either of those two dishes if you come here! They are both packed with plenty of protein and fresh pasta.\", u'There\\'s a few times in my life that I can actually say the Italian food I had was amazing and authentic and this is definitely one of those times! We came here as a party of 5 and we\\'re seated promptly. The menu is pretty straight forward but there are some \"star\" dishes. \\nIt seems like the mixed reviews are based on what your order so make sure you order the right thing!!! \\n\\nFor the appetizers we ordered a few.. my favorite was the burrata soft and fluffy! Seriously hands down best burrata ever. The artichoke bowl was alright, nothing very special, and neither was the mozzarella Carozza. So get the BURRATA! \\n\\nFor the entrees I am a pasta fanatic so the first thing I ask is if all the pastas are made in house and if not which ones are made in house. The waiter explained which pastas were made in house and I made sure to order one of those. They had a special which was gnocchi with pesto and tomato sauce on the bottom and burrata on top it was absolutely amazing and I would give it a perfect 10. The gnocchi were like fluffy pillows. Sadly it is only a special and I\\'m not sure if it will be available when you visit. My mother had the lobster ravioli which she also really enjoyed. The chicken cutlet was also really really good along with the angel hair that it came with.  The Caesar salad was nothing special and it does not have a usual creamy Caesar dressing it had more of an oil dressing. I do not recommend the Caesar salad. I would stick with burrata for an appetizer and for the entr\\xe9e I would get one of the pastas that are made in house.\\n\\n\\nI had the banana and nutella gelato for dessert and it was amazing with chunks of nutella inside the creamy banana gelato.\\n\\n\\nThe only NEGATIVE IS THAT THEY RUSH. I would consider them slightly arrogant. The bus boys run around like chickens without heads. They should calm down and not attack and rush. I give a 5 based on the food. Service could use improvement. \\n\\nCash and credit accepted. \\nBar area seating. \\nIndoor and outdoor seating.', u\"We came here for dinner and we're not disappointed! I had one of the specials (seafood fra diavolo) for my main course, and it was amazing. So much food and all the seafood was fresh. We also had the mozzarella appetizer and the crab cakes appetizer (another special). Both were great, but the crab cakes were definitely the star. Even after all this food, we decided to try the tiramisu. It very good and seemed to be very fresh. Overall, the restaurant is very cute and nicely decorated, the staff was very nice, and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal!\", u\"You always hear about the mom and pop Italian spots in NYC. All we can say about Positano's is WOW! The porky shanks were gigantic! My swordfish with olives and cherry tomatoes was the special. Eating street side on a pleasant summer evening enhanced the experience!\\n\\nBonus: very close to Ft Hamilton in south Brooklyn with valet parking\", u\"The food wasn't bad but the manager was very rude. I'll never go there. They make me feel uncomfortable.\", u'I\\'m giving it 2 stars because the food is good   HOWEVER, SAL the manager or owner (so he claims) \\nis the rudest and crassest  person I have ever had the displeasure to come across in a restaurant. \\nMy friends and I were unable to carry on a conversation because of the poor sound system.  The so-called music was loud  and unrecognizable (That\\'s how bad it was!!! ) When i told him it was terrible his response was \"REALLY? WELL I LIKE IT\".   I then asked if he was the owner to which he replied \"no I\\'m just passing by\". What in the world does that mean and how does someone treat a customer with such disregard and disrespect??  He later came over, said he WAS the owner and wanted  to explain why he was so rude which was even more bizarre. His reasoning? WE INSULTED HIS MUSIC!!   I didn\\'t know music in a restaurant was for the manager/owner and not for the patrons.  Silly me!!   \\nJust a word of warning if you decide on eating here ....  mums the word when it comes to Sal\\'s music or you may get a reprimand!'], u'209.Umai Ramen': [u\"Best ramen in the zip code!\\n\\nSo you don't need to trek out of your hood for it. But for everyone in the zip code and neighboring ones (11218, 11219, 11223, 11228, 11230), you have to try this place! And if you have try this place when they first opened, you have to come back again as they revamped their menu and add two items that are must-eat and one that you can get for free for just being a Yelper!\\n\\nMust Eat Item 1: Takoyaki\\n\\nIf you have never tried takoyaki, it is fried squid balls. Well, technically, there's only one small piece of squid in it and the rest is molten hot wheat batter. It is topped with bonito flakes and okonomiyaki sauce. Why is it so good? It is the molten hot wheat batter. They nailed the temperature here compare to nearby Tenzan's lukewarm version. You might burn your tongue, but it is the same reason why people love Shanghainese soup dumplings. The thin line between pain and pleasure...\\n\\nMust Eat Item 2: Char Siu (sliced pork)\\n\\nYou can get this item in the bun or the ramen. I had it in the ramen. It is 1/2 inch thick and has a thin char to give a little added flavor. Unlike the Takoyaki, it was barely warm and it won't burn your tongue. Just dunk it in the broth for a few seconds, then bite into it as you taste the broth, the meat, and the gooey, savory pork fat melting in your mouth. Food heaven!!! \\n\\nFree Item (when you check-in on Yelp app): Water Drop Cake\\n\\nThis exploded in Smorgasboard in 2015 (or was it 2014?) and then people forgot about it. If you see my inactivity on Yelp, you probably guessed. I never tried it. So I can't compare it to the original. But it's good. It looks cool. And you get it for free. Can't beat that!\\n\\nAs for the ramen, it is good. Not spectacular, but a good bowl of ramen is more than just the ramen. It is a combination of the ramen, broth and toppings. The Pittai ramen I had was on point with blacken garlic oil and the aforementioned char-siu. The other ramen my wife got was okay. I didn't like the grilled chicken as it was sliced too thin and grilled with skin on which supposedly make it flavorful but ends up scratching your gums because each piece is razor thin. The fries were good but it is no longer curly (at least in our recent visit, maybe they ran out) and that was a mild disappointment for my wife even though it was just as flavorful as in our previous visits. This is a solid 4 stars when compare to any other ramen place in the city but a 5 stars just because it has no worthy competition in the area.\", u\"This is an open kitchen style ramen shop. The decorations is pretty much like any open kitchen ramen shop. Small limited seats for groups and around 10 seats in front of the kitchen. But kitchen seats is a bit uncomfortable due to the height of the table and the round stools and no foot rest I am 6ft and my feet still dangles a bit when eating. \\n\\nThe  broth base is chicken and you can taste the full flavor of the chicken. It is a thick chicken broth that seems to be boiled for a long time until it can get that rich chicken flavor. \\n\\nThe appetizers are pretty okay. Their sweet wasabi sauce is actually good, I liked it more than the pork sausages. Their tako yaki was okay in flavor. \\n\\nThe chicken broth pork ramen is pretty decent. The clear taste of the soup base and the slices of melting pork belly was okay. \\n\\nThe Golden trio ramen, their main seller, turns out to be not as good as it states. The same chicken broth but with pork belly, char sui, and more ingredients and seasoning mixed it. It was salty to the point I could finish it after eating the few slices of pork. \\nI tried the Golden trio soup base and taste the chicken broth ramen again I can't taste the flavor of the soup base. That is how salty it was. Normally I don't drink much water or tea with ramen, but I figured 3 cups of tea even taking my mates tea. I can say I finished 20percent of 5hat bowl of ramen. I rarely waste food, but it was a bit much. WE left quickly. \\n\\nThis is just our opinions. We will be giving it a second chance like other places. Give it a try yourselves.\", u\"We came on a Friday for a party of 2 and was seated immediately. Staff was friendly and the place was cozy. There is 3 seating tables in the back of the store and about 14-15 bar seatings in the store. \\n\\nService:\\nVery good service as they offered me tea multiple times. There was probably 10 people in the restaurant with 2 servers. \\n\\nFood:\\nOkonomiyaki fries, was not bad. Basically curly fries with a half boiled egg in the middle. Their were flakes on top and a little bit of tako yaki sauce w mayo on top. Was a little too salty though. I love fries so I liked it. 4/5 for this order.\\n\\nSeafood Paitan, I tried a little since it wasn't my order. All the seafood is frozen as I am sitting by the bar. For 12$ seafood what did you expect?! But it tasted good none the less. You can choose thick or thin noodle. The broth can be better, tasted like corn chowder and not enough taste imo. 3/5 at best for this bowl.\\n\\nTan Tan Paitan, ramen w meat shreds on top. Waiter claims it to be he spiciest ramen on the menu. However it was not spicy for me, but then again my tolerance for spiciness is higher than most. The broth had more taste than the seafood Paitan. The noodle texture did not disappoint. I def recommend the tan tan Paitan over the seafood Paitan. 4.5/5 for this bowl.\\n\\nRain Drop Cake, was an experience. Texture was jello like. Hard to explain with words, there was a flower inside the rain drop. I believe it's a chrysanthemum, it kind of tasted like grass jelly. Probably something you order once to just try.\\n\\nAll in all the place was good. I would recommend it, its worth the price you pay. Not much on the menu so we ordered relatively fast.\", u\"I first came here when they initially opened; when their banner still said New York Lottery. My first experience here was bad. The broth was too salty and the noodles were so soggy that I really disliked my meal. I decided to come back today to try it again since it has been quite awhile since they opened and Fay Wong Cafe a block away was super packed. \\n\\nUpon entering, the waitress sat us down immediately. On a Sunday afternoon, it was quite empty inside. There are two tables of four and everything else are stool seats by the bar. Their bar seats have charging stations for you to charge your electronics, which is a plus for many people that are low on battery. They also provide us ladies with hair ties to tie our hair when we eat our ramen. How thoughtful is that?! \\n\\nThe ramen this time was a lot better than I expected. I didn't have high hopes based on my last experience. Their menu seemed to change a bit too. I really enjoy the fact that they let you choose between thin or thick noodles!\\n\\n1) BLACK GARLIC PAITAN RAMEN: I had\\nBlack Garlic Ramen once in the city and it was amazing, so I decided to try it here. The broth was not too salty yet flavorful. The ramen was not soggy which is a huge plus in my book. I really enjoyed every bit of this ramen and recommend it to others!\\n\\n2) GOLDEN RATIO RAMEN: My boyfriend decided on this. He said for $15 it was pretty decent (he's a picky eater too) and he said for the price you get a lot in your ramen. There was a lot of meat inside and that's what he likes too. He said the broth was a little on the saltier side but mixing everything together in the bowl made it edible. \\n\\nFor the price and my experience this time around, I am pretty satisfied and makes me want to come back. You can't compare city ramen restaurants to here. Of course it'll be different. I even think my experience this time was better than Ippudo because both times at ippudo my broth was extremely salty.\\n\\nI subtracted a star because I like my broth to be hot and not warm when it's served.\", u\"This is one of the top ramen places in Brooklyn according to my taste buds. I've had two of their appetizers ( fries and takoyaki) and they were simply delicious! They offered two types of noodles for their ramen : thin and thick. I had the thicker one in miso soup and it was just right in opinion. Super rich, salty, and packed with flavors. The noodles were a just the right texture. Needless to say, I will definitely be back.\", u'Do not expect Ippudo, Totto, or Ivan Ramen... with that said, it\\'s a decent ramen joint.  Recommend: The Black Garlic Oil Ramen - more robust flavor.\\n\\nIt\\'s a small space, a few tables in the back and bar seatings.  The owner was very hands-on, very nice and courteous, and the staff were all very nice.  \\n\\nWe got the Black Garlic Oil ramen and the Spicy Miso; got the fried squid and gyoza...  appetizers were OK, the gyoza are frozen ones, not homemade like at \"Naruto at the slopes\". The noodles are the yellow thick ones - not the thin kind.  The Spicy Miso - something was off about this bowl... possibly could\\'ve been ruined by those darn fish roe! It just made the broth a bit too fishy! And the spice bomb was NOT spicy enough. \\n\\nOverall decent ramen joint, PLUS - it\\'s near my hood, would come back bc of the proximity! LOL', u'Ramen here is average, not the best. Their pork buns are drenched with sauce. Their fried rice is delicious though.', u\"Not recommended. Worst ramen place I've ever tried. Everything was too salty. I would not come back again.\", u\"This ramen spot is pretty good - it's definitely a little bit overpriced for what it's worth but some of the food here is definitely worth trying.  I especially recommend the curly french fries that they serve where they top it off with an egg yolk and some mayo.  Mix it up and you have deliciousness!  I usually order the spicy miso ramen because the broth tastes amazing, but the last time I went, it was extremely salty.  They also put ginger as well in some of the ramen, so if you're not about that, make sure you tell them that you don't want the ginger. \\n\\nOverall, this is a pretty nice place, with a good amount of seating and neatly decorated as well.\", u\"This review is for takeout only. \\n\\nI was very excited when I learned that a ramen shop was going to pop up in Bensonhurst. I literally work a block away so I planned on coming here to grab dinner before heading home. I came on a Saturday night around 9 and there were 4 other people in the restaurant. They have a variety of options on their menu (chicken broth, seafood, vegetarian, etc.), as well as a whole page of appetizers. I ordered the shoyu ($8.5) to go. \\n\\nThey separate the noodles and soup in different containers. The soup was still decently warm after my 20 minute ride home - I didn't feel the need to heat it back up. The soup is thick and not too salty! The shoyu ramen had an egg, bamboo shoots, some corn, and bean sprouts. I liked that they included corn and half an egg because some other places in the city charge extra. \\n\\nOverall, this is a solid ramen place. I hope they stick around because I'll be coming every time I crave ramen and don't want to travel all the way to the city for it.\", u\"I did not have high expectations for their ramen after reading their yelp reviews. They have really nice decorations which brings a mood of being in Japan, although the store isn't even owned by Japanese. \\n\\nI have to say, their fries were really good, which basically tastes like takoyaki, but in the form of fries. The ramen was nothing much that I was expecting. The noodles felt like instant noodle ramen, which comes with a really weird soup base. In fact, the broth was just bad. It was a nice environment with polite service, but maybe I'll opt out for their ramen.\", u'Very happy that Ramen places are starting to open up in Brooklyn. This saves me the long train ride to the city since it\\'s so close by. I was pleasantly surprised by the Ramen, especially since it\\'s made by Chinese people. The chicken broth was very rich  and tasty, almost as good as Totto\\'s actually. The char siu was surprisingly good, even better than some of the Japanese places in the city (i\\'m looking at you Ramen lab and your gross dry char siu). Corn as a topping is a little weird and I would like to see them explore an alternative topping to that.\\nI also had the okonomiyaki fries, which had a poached egg on top with a bunch of sauce and seaweed flakes, super yummy and nice gooey egg. I\\'ll definitely come back to try their other stuff!\\n\\nEdit: came back today around 3pm for a quick lunch. The restaurant was empty except for another 2 guests. The menu has been updated, and i can tell it draws \"inspiration\" from Totto\\'s ramen menu lmao. The appetizers are on the back, with ramens on the front. I think prices have gone up a bit since last time, with the most expensive ramen on the menu, the \"Golden Ratio Ramen\" at $15. I opted for this one today, along with the \"Ika Geso\" (the fried squid).\\n\\nFirst off, the squid was absolutely delicious. The squid itself was perfectly cooked - tender with a good bite to it, and no chewiness at all. They clearly prepared the squid well before frying. The batter was minimal, and just barely coated the squid. It\\'s served in a bed of raw cabbage which I ate as well for some freshness. The wasabi mayo was great also. This dish I would totally recommend.\\n\\nThe Golden Ratio Ramen was very disappointing. First, the price. At $15, it is quite expensive. It comes with all of the toppings they offer, including Pork Jowl which I love (best part of the pig). However, they only gave a few measly slices of pork Jowl, and it wasn\\'t even tender. The pork Jowl is the reason this bowl is more expensive than the rest. Even more disappointing, half of the bowl was bean sprouts. I wish I was exaggerating but I\\'m not. Not only did they pile on a mountain of bean sprouts on top, there are sprouts throughout the noodles, and under the noodles as well! I feel like I was eating a bowl of bean sprouts! Gross. I\\'m not sure if they do this to give us less ramen or what, but they really need to stop with the excessive bean sprouts. There was barely enough soup because of all the sprouts, which just ruined the bowl of ramen for me. I hope they re-evaluate the bean sprout situation because I am definitely not paying $15 again for a bowl of sprouts.\\n\\nAlso, the cha siu situation has worsened. Only half of the cha siu is tender, while the meat part was a bit dry and sad. Really disappointed because the first time I had it it was quite good!\\n\\nThe service is still awkward as ever. The servers hover around as you eat, which makes me feel super uncomfortable (maybe it\\'s because there\\'s never anyone else eating at the restaurant besides me). The moment you get the menu, they give you 30 seconds before asking you what you want. STOP.', u\"I was pretty excited that a ramen place was opening in this area because it's super convenient for me.\\n\\nThe char siu bun was, in a word, gross. The char siu tasted more sweet than savory, and the white sauce in the bun did not contribute any flavor to the bun but made the whole thing feel so greasy as you chew it.\\n\\nI went a while ago, so I don't remember exactly which ramen bowls I ordered, but I remember that I was NOT impressed with the broth at all. To me, the broth is the best part of the ramen so if that's not good, then it's over. The broth lacked flavor other than being salty. It was not rich or fragrant. The ramen noodles themselves were all right, nothing amazing but acceptable in terms of texture and taste. The other ingredients in the ramen were subpar in quality, taste, and amount. Saddest bowl of ramen ever.\\n\\nPrice wise, this place is much cheaper than other ramen places. However, it also is not as good as other ramen places...\\n\\nGranted, I went around the day or so after grand opening so maybe that's why? Unfortunately, I don't think I can bring myself to go back so I'll never know if they're better now.\", u'When I first saw that this part of Bensonhurst had a ramen shop I was excited, but I came here twice and felt the service and food was mediocre. The first time I tried this location with my boyfriend, there was no awning displaying that it\\'s a ramen shop and it still had the old signage that said \"LOTTO\". They also didn\\'t have their hours of operation displayed anyway or real menus, just paper menus. \\n\\nThe first time I came with my boyfriend was a Sunday afternoon and it was getting packed each minute. They have an open kitchen with a counter where you can see the chef and their preparation like a traditional ramen shop. It\\'s also a lot cheaper in terms of price compared to most ramen shops. We started off with the Ika Geso (fried squid with sweet mayonnaise sauce) and it was delicious and tasty. The only thing I didn\\'t like about this dish was that the tentacles weren\\'t cut smaller. \\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the Bonito Ramen (chicken & fish based broth, homemade chicken, scallion, bamboo shoots, bean sprout, marinated egg, dry seaweed, and homemade ramen sea salt sauce). His ramen looked very simple and plain. I tried the broth and I wasn\\'t a fan of it. It tasted very bland and didn\\'t have enough flavor or juices. \\n\\nI ordered the Umai Bonito Ramen (chicken based broth , homemade bonito, scallions, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, marinated egg, dry seaweed, homemade ramen soy sauce & black garlic oil). My ramen looked somewhat similar to my boyfriend\\'s ramen except I had the black garlic oil which really made the ramen extra delicious. The broth was very thick and rich. I wasn\\'t a fan of the marinated egg, tasted a little weird.  \\n\\nAfter we finished our food and asked for the bill, it took a while for them to get it to us which I didn\\'t quite understand why.\\n\\nThe second time I came was with my cousin on a Friday night around 6:30-7PM and I was expecting it to be crowded at this point, but the restaurant was quiet and only partially filled. My cousin and I ordered the Okonomiyaki Fries which was served with a poached egg. Good choice for an appetizer, savory and delicious. It was so good, we ordered a second order of it. I didn\\'t really like the fact that one of the waitresses would take our plates away when we were still talking and waiting for our ramen. How does she know we\\'re not going to order another appetizer? The ramen we had this time wasn\\'t very savory or delicious. I felt the broth was very bland and can use some flavor. I also feel like the pork wasn\\'t very broiled. It had no charredness on it. We finished our dinner at 7:30-7:45PM and the restaurant was still not full up to it\\'s capacity yet which is strange.\\n\\nOverall, it\\'s nice that there\\'s a ramen shop that\\'s convenient and not too far away, but I feel that there are some areas that need to be improved. Food is okay for this particular part of Bensonhurst, but definitely not a restaurant I would rank as the best ramen I\\'ve had. Service could be better. I felt like the waitresses were a bit rushy with taking our order when we were trying to read the menu. Hopefully they\\'ll step up their game soon.', u'Vegetarian ramen noodles was awesome, served with hot green tea .  Place was nicely decorated and clean!', u\"I ordered the black garlic oil ramen and the broth was very flavorful but the ramen noodle itself wasn't as chewy I would like it. It was a bit on the soggier side. It's definitely not up to par with the ones in Manhattan. I would only come here if i'm really craving ramen and too lazy to trek out there. \\n\\nGet the wings & fries, it was super crispy!\", u\"The food was okay- a little above average, 3.5. A lot of the broths were fish based however, they didn't have any fish broth, they only had the chicken broth. Waited a really really long time for food and service. I needed to ask twice for water and tea because they were really busy. I understand that because it was their first opening day. \\n\\nI got really full just from the appetizers. I had the fries (drenched in sauce and an egg!) and pork buns. The fries is a must get though! The pork buns were 1 for $2 and 3 for $5. Then the ramen came an hour later. I guess it was worth the wait! \\n\\nI would not pay full price for these items. I only came to this place because it was 50% off today. I gotten the seafood ramen because the picture looked really good on the menu however, it hasn't quite reached my expectation. Nonetheless, it was still good considering that there were scallops and shrimps and two slice of pork. After that I had the fried squid, which was small but also cheap I guess. It was $2.50 for a few pieces. The sauce that comes with it was sort of like wasabi-honey. \\n\\nHowever I have a love hate feeling with it because it seems that the servers forgot about us. When my friend went out to get cash, they took my friend's chair to another set of table, I had to tell them someone was sitting there. \\n\\nThe service wasn't good and totally unorganized. I saw a women complain about forgetting her order. They forgot about my squid as well. We had to keep reminding them and repeat our order three times. When the bill came, they charged us more than what we needed to pay. They don't have fish broth, they don't have marinated chicken - I don't understand why is it on the menu then.\", u'Finally no more waiting for a long line in the city for some awesome ramen! This place has the best creamy chicken soup base! If your ever in Brooklyn, a must stop by place for some comfort food!', u\"The rating is actually a 3.5 \\n\\nI came here on a Sunday afternoon with my boyfriend since this place was near his house. We have been meaning to try it for a while, since there are not many ramen places in the area. The place had a bit of people, but we manage to get a seat at a table. There were some table for seating and a lot of the people sat in the bar area, there is around 10-15 seats on the bar area and the table area can fit around 10-15 people, so the place isn't that big. \\n\\nWe ordered the Okonomiyaki fries, which were pretty bomb. I really liked the combination and it was super tasty and something different, than your regular fries. I ordered the R1 which was chicken broth and I thought it was alright. The soup base was not super flavorful and it tasted a bit healthy. My boyfriend got R6 which was the Shoyu Ramen and I thought his broth tasted way better than mine. The noodles themselves and everything else was alright, it wasn't anything too special. Our bill came out to be $27 with tips and tax which was alright for a ramen place and def. much cheaper than in the city. \\n\\nOverall, I found the food to be alright not super great and the portions sizes were a tad bit small compared to the city, but then again the prices are cheaper than the city so I guess that makes up for it.\", u\"The food I would say is a 3.5 stars so giving it a 4. The menu was a but confusing there was R1 and a R2 dish that was exactly the same but the R2 was about 3 dollars more the only different was the seasoning. I got the R1 was around $8 not much different for a R2. Appetizer ranged around $5. It is definitely a lot cheaper than having $15 ramen.\\n\\nNow the ramen had two char siu, egg, scallion, bamboo shoot and white bean sprout with chicken broth. You can definitely taste the chicken broth. Ot's pretty good even though I had way better ramen, but for the price you pay it's what you get for. I also order the okonomiyaki fries that came with a runny egg. It was sooooo GOOD a definitely must try. We also order the char siu bun since it was cheap 3 buns for $5 whereas in the manhattan 2 for about $6-8 depending which ramen place. The char siu bun was good too you can definitely taste the soft and fatty-ness of the char siu. Overall, the food was average. It's definitely a good local place to go to for either lunch or dinner if you have a craving for ramen. Will come back when I want ramen.\"], u'176.Dromedary Bar': [u\"I came here with a co-worker out of convenience and I must say we left surprised that we hadn't tried it before. \\nThe staff is friendly, the food was amazing and the drinks were perfectly balanced. \\nThe night we came they actually had a caberet show going on, which was very cool. \\nThey also seem to have shot tastings sometimes to encourage you to try new liquor vendors. I always like trying new stuff because you can end up really surprised sometimes. \\nThey do have quite a few edibles to help soak up your drinks and the fries are perfectly delicious. \\n\\nI will be back to try to again. \\nOh by the way, they do have happy hour.\", u\"Total garbage. 1 large portion of overlooked fries dripping in cooking oil. 2 cans of coke, 1 small burger & fries for $21!?\\n\\nComplete and utter sh*t - I took one bite of the fries and couldn't eat anymore. The burger was reasonable but for that price totally not worth it. Your better off getting off your ass and walking to the deli and getting a turkey sandwich for $4.\", u\"There are other bars in NY that meet a similar quotient of tiki as Dromedary, however those bars think they are way more legitimate of a tiki bar than they actually are. I got the sense that Dromedary is self aware, and knows that it is a tiki-ish dive bar. \\n\\nThe food was decent for my level of inebriation, but I got the sense I would have loved the food if I was significantly drunker. We got some Flamingo Fries (I think thats what it was called) which had this strange sweet sauce all over them and some double decker tacos that were like a high end Taco Bell meal. With that said, Dromedary seems like a better place to end your night than to start it. The drinks were a little sweet for my taste, but quite drinkable. The drinks were also more inspired than I expected by the ambiance. I think I'll wait till its dark out before I return here.\", u'Cute Tiki bar. I loved the pink flamingo  drink holders they were super adorable. Think I made a mistake in going there just for the food. I had a spicy burger, fries and garlic bread. When I got the burger  it just looked like a Master Piece. As I started eating  it got super messy and started falling apart with each bite.The garlic bread was not my cup of tea , its just one small piece of bread dripping  in grease. The place in appearance and in service  was awesome. I would  definitely  go back for just drinks.', u\"Amazing corner bar with a cocktail menu inspired\\nby the tiki gods.\\n\\nEver since the closure of End of the Century (R.I.P.) I've been looking for a semi-local replacement tiki spot to call my own without having to trek into the city or all the way over in Cobble Hill (I see you Zombie Hut!) so was super excited to find this place.\\n\\nMy Zombie was on point, though my dates drink Flowers for the Dead was extremely good and truly impressed.\\n\\nReally enjoyed this place and will absolutely be back for Scorpion bowls and chill vibes.\", u\"Do you want crickets? Because that's how you get crickets!\\n\\nDromedary has a disproportionate amount of cocktails with crickets or cricket related ingredients (like bitters). But they're easily avoidable and the rest of their tiki cocktail selection is wonderful.\\n\\nTheir menu is super helpful diagrams so you know exactly what you're getting into.\\n\\nMy favorite cocktail was Kaf-FEAR and Loathing in Las Vegas, though I also liked the Glass Moon as well. The Marlin Chasing Mermaids is what you want for your Instagram feed, since it's served in the famous ceramic shark mug. That one was described as a Spanish daiquiri, and it definitely delivered on that promise.\\n\\nTheir bigger bathroom is also photogenic, with an illustration of a topless girl on a swing repeated all over the walls.\\n\\nThere's a kitchen in the back with a separate ordering system. I had a cheeseburger, taco, and fries (the fries were only a $1 because it was Friday. They have other daily deals too!). It was all pretty good as far as a bar food goes.\\n\\nI don't know if I'll ever be back in the area, but if I am, I'll definitely stop by again!\", u'I was lucky enough to stop in for tiki drinks on a night when the owner himself was bar tending. As a West Coast native and tiki enthusiast, I was initially skeptical of a self proclaimed \"Urban tiki bar\", especially one with no Mai Tai on the menu. However, after scoping out the charming hand-drawn menu, I was intrigued. Most of the cocktails (reasonably priced from $11-$13), sounded unlike any tropical drink I have ever tried. \\n\\nMy friend and I shared a Scorpion Bowl-a tiki classic. However, this bowl was unlike anything I have ever tasted, in a good way! Along with the rum base were gin, star anise, and fresh citrus flavors. Delicious and sweet without being syrupy. The KAF-fir and Loathing in Las Vegas was also outstanding. Sweet pineapple up front, followed by some peppery spice and punch of lime leaves, and the lingering aftertaste of Campari. Complex and flavorful. If you enjoy unique craft cocktails in a fun laid back environment, you will love this bar. I will definitely be back.', u'I really should start reviewing bars. So, here we go: Dromedary was recommended by my Bushwick buddies as a great place to play games and drink tiki. And that\\'s exactly what it was! Our bartender was awesome. She was friendly and gave us some helpful suggestions. I tried the Mt. Kilauea Colada, which isn\\'t only delicious and deceivingly strong, but it\\'s also beautiful (see photo). I also had the Hunka Hunka and the frozen option (don\\'t remember the name). All drinks are incredible here! My bf really enjoyed his Black Manta. We shamelessly split the beef nachos, which in his words are \"the best kind of nachos.\" We played XL Jenga, Taboo, Candyland and tried our hand at the pinball machines. This place is amazing and I can\\'t wait to come back.', u\"This is a great friggin' bar!  The atmosphere is so lively.  The patrons are cool and good natured and the staff is professional and cool under pressure.  I've been here a few times, only on Thursdays.  That's kareoke night.  Its bigger than most bars which means theres room to sit at a table.  It has outdoor seating by the sidewalk and in the back.  They serve good tasty appetizer type food.  I love it here and always have a great time.\", u'Love this place! Fun creative drinks! Could have a little more staff behind the bar for when it gets busy but otherwise awesome spot. Good food too.', u'Pina colada was tasty.Food came out extremely quickly.  Burgers and nachos were alright. Place is mostly \"self-service\" and has good happy hour deals.\\n\\nPlace looks very cool. It has outside seating and pinball machines.', u\"Best bar in bushwick. Happy hour oysters, mai tai's! The burger was bomb. Check out dromedary bar :)\", u\"If you know me, then you know anything tiki has my name all over it.\\nThe bar itself is  gorgeous! I loved all the knickknacks on the back bar, big and spacious, good for big groups. The drink menu was interesting in a good way and I wish I could've tried another. I came in because I follow their Instagram and had been craving a burger. Low and behold, they posted about having burgers! So I went. It was pretty dead, which is fine. However, I felt a little neglected by my bartender. I dunno if the guy she was chatting with was the owner, but her back was turned away from patrons a lot. Granted there were all 6 of us but it felt pretty cold shoulder-like. The burger was delicious, the sauce they put on it to die for. The fries were overly greasy but I loved the Parmesan on them. I ended up leaving after because I didn't really feel too welcome. \\nI'm going to try it again maybe on a weekend, but meh overall.\", u'This was the first time I ordered from them and I loved the food.  The delivery came fast and was still warm.  My Yorkies loved their Poochie Patties too.', u\"Understated tiki vibe and great drinks. Duncan's Burgers really rounds this place out!\\n\\nWe wanted a quiet time so dropped in an hour before karaoke on a Thursday. Got a Glass Moon that I could've sipped on all night - passionfruit, bourbon, egg white and tiki bitters topped with macadamia shavings! So tasty. Of course I I had to try another cocktail so I got the Marlin Chasing Mermaids. Not only did it come in an adorable tiki ceramic glass, it had a whole banana, smokey mezcal, perfumey rose extract, and some other delicious additions that escape me right now. \\n\\nWe also ordered burgers and fries from Duncan's in the back. The beef was perfectly salty and the pickles tasted really fresh. I got a side of spicy honey and drizzled it all over my crispy fries for an extra treat.\\n\\nGo! It's so good! Check out their Facebook for weekly events like trivia and karaoke.\", u'The vibe was cool: garage/tiki.\\nThe bartender is what threw the place off. She was extremely slow when it wasn\\'t too busy and would chat up people even though she had a lot of people waiting. She complained to us when we asked for a drink and told us: \"You\\'ll have to wait. I\\'m working the whole bar right now by myself.\" Not appealing to complain about your job to customers. We ended up leaving before getting our last drinks that we ordered because she took too long.\\n\\nHowever, the drinks we did get were amazing. Try the ones with the odd ingredients because it\\'s so worth it.\\nThe food was good too. Got the beef nachos and garlic parmesan fries. Only thing I\\'d say about the nachos is that they should have had real cheese instead of that creamy nacho \"cheese.\"', u\"Even if you don't drink, come for the food! Duncan's Burger killing it. Great sandwiches and snacks with plenty of special deals if you wanna take advantage of them. \\n\\nVeggie burger available and is\", u'Walked in not expecting anything much, just wanted to have a happy hour drink. The bartender and the staff was friendly and chill and the Daiquiris were deelish. Also an order of large fries was huge! And also yum. Going to go back again and hope our experience is as fun as it was the first time.', u\"10 years ago in Bushwick, white guys in Hawaiian shirts making banana daquiries with little umbrellas in them would've been robbed at gunpoint.\\n\\nGentrification is a mothafucker. \\n\\nDromedary is super inviting, aesthetically pleasing, and overall a wonderful atmosphere to drift into off the Brooklyn streets. Old school tiki glassware, a cigarette machine from the 1920s, eccentric anime wallpaper in the bathroom. Exterior covered in dope street art. Projector screen showing throwback films. Great eclectic mix of music playing. \\n\\nThe food menu is made to be shared. The Pupu platter Korean ribs and bbq chicken legs were both super moist, flavorful, and fell right off the bone. The deviled eggs come in 3 varieties. Don't be scared of the crickets! The pork belly sandwich with fried brussel sprouts was a huge portion of tender meat and it was fantastic. The macaroni salad with toasted coconut and habanero is perfect. \\n\\nThe drink menu is where Michael the owner really showcases his skills. This man knows his mixology. The Marlin Chasing a Mermaid is a deconstructed banana daquiri made with mezcal to give it a hint of smoke. The Coconut Soda tastes like a prohibition era drug store treat. The Glass Moon is a spin on a whiskey sour, made with all fresh ingredients, some things I couldn't pronounce, and egg whites. It was my favorite drink of the evening. \\n\\nIt's brand new, so they have some kinks to work out, but this place is off to an amazing start.\", u\"Walked in for a quick drink and I get this thing called a marlin chasing mermaid? Delicious banana daiquiri awesomeness! Can't wait to try another cocktail tbd :)\"], u'98.Little Forno': [u\"Tasty!  Love that I don't have to go out to Park Slope or Williamsburg for a good brunch spot anymore.  Bay ridge is seriously lacking.  Everything we ordered at Little Forno was great!\\n\\n- Monkfish fritters: crispy and the sauce was super flavorful\\n- Frittata: loved the spinach and thinly sliced onions\\n- Chicken and waffles: chicken was juicy and crispy, and coated in a yummy honey chili sauce (waffle could be more crispy though)\\n\\nFood was so good, our baby was literally screaming for more.  Best of all, the service was outstanding - they were super nice and one the owners came around a couple times to see how we were doing.  We're excited to come back to try their dinner menu!\", u\"Wow!! Was in the neighborhood visiting family and took a chance on this place that just opened. The food was outstanding - seriously have never had this kind of food in this area before. Someone told us the chef used to run Tom Collicchio's Craftbar in Manhattan and so that explains it. Jealous of my family who live by this joint cause I'd be here all the time!\\n\\nThe food is primarily Italian but fancier, more upscale and delicious. What's nice is the place doesn't feel overly fancy; it's super cozy and quaint. Staff were very friendly and checked on us many times.\\n\\nWe had the scallops, which were sliced thin and melt in your mouth. As was the monkfish in this butter sauce - holy cow, awesome. We also took a chance on the octopus appetizer which the server recommended and it was also tasty and unlike anything I've had. \\n\\nCan't wait to go back - great to see places like this now exist in Bay Ridge!\", u\"Six of us had a terrific dinner last night at this place. Starters included charred octopus & salads. The steak entre was delicious! It was cooked to your taste & sliced beautifully on the plate. Portions were ample. I had the orchietto with butter & cheese-WOW, so good. Nice wine list- try the Malbec, very good. Desserts included a delicious pumpkin bread with Carmel & whipped cream and cookies with milk. The cookies were huge with various flavors. A great meal at a fair price and we'll be back.\", u'Very good nice small place food was amazing, so good. Good service, I had  the pasta and the octopus. Quality food amazing taste', u\"Very first customers of the brand new Little Forno. Replaces the Petit Oven, which we were sad to see go, but this very slick new American place with Italian roots took its place: Little Forno. Gracious service and a manageable menu loaded with things I wanted to try but had to choose only a couple of items: excellent, tender octopus with black olive aioli, and lovely monk fish in butter fondue with trumpet (?) mushrooms. Excellent. My wife's prosciutto wrapped chicken and polenta was sharp. Nouvelle size servings, so you don't feel bloated, just satisfied. Outstanding Panna cotta. And Vin Santo by the glass. Not cheap but quite good. As expected.\", u'What a gem! A hidden treasure.. the best kind; but not for long! We were hungry and it was getting late on a Friday night while the weather was just about turning into Fall... we were going to hit an old standby, but thankfully we took the suggestion from friends to visit Little Forno. So happy we did. Chris and his staff were friendly and attentive, (our server Kim was knowledgeable and upbeat), the music was just right (the kind of stuff you heard in the back of your dads classic car way back when), and we sat right in the window. The menu was small enough to not scratch your head, but so interesting that we had questions. A bottle of wine, sexy portions, water glasses never empty. A perfect date night. Be sure to look up at the copper ceiling and take a moment to admire the warm family photographs on the walls. We look forward to checking out their new brunch menu soon. If the waffles are as good as the strawberry jam foie gras, if the bellinis are as decadent as the perfectly seared steak... we are gonna be in heaven here in Bay Ridge for a hopeful long, long time. Big props to John, the finest busboy around, who refolded my napkin when I left my seat. A comfortable, delicious time. Check out Little Forno... impress your parents, impress your girl.', u\"Tonight was date night with the hubby. He said lets try a new place my co-worker and her husband just opened.Got there im like ok place was nice size and the atmosphere was cozy. We were greeted with smiles and great service.  Starters we choose the octopus dish. This was my first time having octopus and i was expecting something chewy and weird. It was the complete opposite it was meaty and tender with a lovely sauce. The main course i opted to have the riccotta cheese spring onions im going to say it was like a ravioli but it wasn't the traditional shape. I loved it and my husband had the chicken dish i cant recall the name and he said it was delious. The experience was wonderful.\", u\"My husband and I ate at Little Forno this evening and it was absolutely delicious! Everything was great, but I think the highlight was all the sauces that accompanied the food. My absolute favorite dish was the scallop appetizer! The service was also impeccable. Special shout out to the busboy who checked on us consistently, made sure we had water, and made sure to say goodnight to us as we left. We can't wait to come back and try brunch.\", u'They just opened and the food is amazing! Real family feel inside and the guys who own are sweethearts. Check this place out for good food and cute ambiance!', u\"Had wonderful dinner with family at day 2 opening of this quaint cozy venue. Chris and Steve did petit oven patrons proud. Menu choices are original i.e. Different from other bay ridge restaurants. Five of us tried different appetizers and entrees and they were all delicious octopus is a standout as are all homemade pastas and steak! Wine and beer list was also very good. Can't wait to return and also try brunch when available. Environment is warm as they added family photos to location. Welcome to our community!!\", u'My fianc\\xe9 and I decided to try Little Forno tonight and it was excellent! The food was delicious, and the service was perfect. Would definitely recommend! Great date spot. Reasonable prices.', u'Let me preface this by saying I\\'m intent on supporting any cute new businesses and restaurants opening in Bay Ridge (which are not vape shops or nail salons). With that said, I was so sad when the restaurant that used to be in this spot closed down and then hugely relieved when this restaurant opened its place. We went for the first time last night to celebrate a birthday and we were very impressed! The service, atmosphere, and food were all great. You can tell the owners really care about this place and keeping customers happy. Everyone was incredibly friendly and they even went out of their way to print \"Happy Birthday\" on the menus and included candles with dessert. The menu is small-ish but everyone was able to find something they wanted and everything was delicious (Little Gem salad, charred octopus and scallop sausage appetizers, monk fish and flatiron steaks (x3) for mains, and milk and cookies and pana cotta for dessert). Happy to have a new cute restaurant with an upscale menu and a homey feel in the neighborhood and looking forward to going back!'], u'66.Clover Club': [u\"One of my favorite places to grab brunch. \\n\\nI was slightly put off the first time I popped my head in as it doesn't get very crowded during the weekend, but man are people missing out.\\n\\nEverything is amazing. If you can't make up your mind I'd recommend the fried chicken and baked eggs.\", u'One of my biggest pet peeves about bars and restaurants is that many don\\'t cross over well. You may have a fantastic cocktail at a bar, but they serve no food, or passable bar food or have an amazing meal, but all that\\'s on tap is basic mixed drinks. Much like getting a partner who can \"do both\" (whatever that means), the Clover Club bridges the gap between delicious bites and amazing drinks.\\n\\nAfter seeing a movie nearby and wanting a to drink and eat, we came upon the Clover Club. Sitting in a quieter back room, we ordered a round of the Improved Whiskey Cocktails and some burgers. Although the cocktails took a few minutes to be brought to the table, once we got them it was well worth the wait. The key to improving a Whiskey Cocktail? Adding more whisky! I also got a Prime Beef Burger, a juicy delicious piece of meat, which paired very nicely with the whiskey.\\n\\nAfter we all finished and paid the bill, the waitress dropped by again and gave us all whiskey sours on the house - maybe because they were free, but they tasted even better than the Improved Whiskey Cocktail. \\n\\nOverall a great, if not a bit expensive, lounge and bar and a great part of the neighborhood', u\"Great cocktail bar. The bourbon based cocktails here are solid. Old fashions and cocktails that had coffee in it, all of them were superb. The bartender here really knows his craft. Even the sweeter cocktails were refreshing. We sat by the entrance, the sliding windows were open and the weather was great that Sunday evening. We ordered a few snacks. The one I remember the most were these chips that were fried in duck fat I think. Greasy crispy in a good way with good dip.\\n\\nI don't come into Brooklyn very often but if I ever do, Clover Club is one to remember. I like the atmosphere in here and the menu and bar here is just one of the best I've seen. I also love this neighborhood and I highly recommend Clover Club for those who are visiting or reside in this section of Brooklyn.\", u\"I had been meaning to try Clover Club for the longest time, and got to try it after dinner nearby. It was a nice night, the front door was open, and the jazz band had just finished playing, so we headed to the back bar area to sit. The bar in the back wasn't being serviced, so we had to go back into the front main space to get drinks, which took a while. Yet, it didn't ruin our time at all, as the back bar area was fairly empty, for a more intimate vibe.\\n\\nI got the Slope, which was rye whiskey, apricot brandy, sweet vermouth, and bitters. Very spirit-forward, but the brandy also added a little bit of sweetness at the same time. I also got to try the Victory Garden: London dry gin, tomato water, strawberry, basil, fino sherry, and lemon. Refreshing, and a little sweeter, if that's your thing. Overall, we sat and even though we had finished our drinks, the vibe was just very comfortable and the conversation was going, so we stayed a little longer without getting more cocktails, simply because it was late, and it would have taken a while just to order and pick them up. \\n\\nService was pretty attentive, but you do have to be pretty patient with your drinks, because they do take a little while to be prepared, which is expected because of all of the ingredients available. Pricing is a bit more expensive for drinks, but both drinks we got were fairly unique and very tasty, so you know that you're getting a quality product. Can't speak to the food, but the pictures we saw on Yelp looked good, so I'll have to come back for brunch or a late dinner.\\n\\nOverall, we had a great time, and the vibe was perfect for late night cocktails. The whole not serving the separate spaces was a little annoying, but it was still probably one of the best nights I've had in Brooklyn. Can't argue with that.\", u\"This place is nice to sit with some drinks and chat. I came here with a group and we sat for a while. Prices are reasonable and the wines are good. They dim the lights as the evening progresses so the ambience gets cozier and date- like. Sadly they don't have a happy hour on weekends. \\n\\nI tried the chips fried in duck fat which were really good and the cornflake covered shrimp. Would recommend both. We also got the olives which were good, relatively fresh. \\n\\nThey do have a fireplace section in the back which they let out for events. But that's probably the best place to be especially in the winter.\", u\"Very swanky place. Loved the mac + cheese  and also the brussel sprout dish. I actually have enjoyed all the dishes Ive ordered here  They have an extensive cocktail menu, the bartenders really know they're doing here.\", u\"Hanger steak FTW! This is a great brunch spot, though I noticed there were various interesting cocktail ingredients were laid out on the bar, so I want to come back & try something later in the evening.\\n\\nThe brunch game is very strong here with multiple egg and non-egg options. My friend and I chose  egg dishes because that's how we roll. We were not disappointed.\\n\\nThe hanger steak and poached eggs blew me away. The bernaise sauce on the eggs and the dressing on the mixed green salad were perfectly paired and light.\\n\\nWe got seated right away - there was a bunch of space to sit at around 1:30, and the waitress came to greet us immediately. No complaints on the staff.\", u'If you want to seriously impress someone, take them to the Clover Club. It\\'s romantic, it\\'s dimly lit, the cocktails albeit expensive are delicious, exquisite and worth it. I came here for a friend\\'s birthday recently and will admit, this is not an ideal birthday spot if you have a lot of friends. If it\\'s like 3-4 people gathering, that may be okay. Anymore, you will be paying a service fee for using up their tables. I paid for two drinks (one for myself and the birthday boy) and what I felt like was literally another person after the \"suggested tip\", \"service fee\", and tax. Yikes. As I said before, really just come with one person here. \\n\\nFor cocktails I ordered the Shuck n\\' Jive. I have no regrets. It\\'s the only drink I tried here aside from my friend\\'s just regular martini and it was unique, refreshing, and strong. Oyster-shell infused vodka, Manzanilla sherry, bianco vermouth, and seaweed shrub. You can pay $3 extra for an oyster garnish. I went without. They pour your drink for this one into a fancy little coupe glass and then throw an additional bottle of the martini on a personal bucket of ice. I love when it seems like you have two in one drinks. They definitely have a drink for everyone and most of them are priced at $13. Menu is divided by bubbly drinks, daisies (sours), tiki drinks, frozen drinks, communal punches (which obviously cost more), more garden and crisp/clean cocktails, traditional cocktails, beer and wine (but why? you\\'re in a damn cocktail bar, son). Also, they serve food and brunch and brunch cocktails. Which I haven\\'t explored at all yet. Happy Hour is from 4-7pm Monday-Friday and select drinks are marked down to $8 for cocktails, $6 wine, $4 beer, and reduced prices for small plates which are pretty reasonably priced.', u'I don\\'t get it. Clover Club is right next door to Cafe Luluc, Luluc is a busy mess for Sunday brunch with the line out the door and crowding the sidewalk. Its loud, the food is not great and the service is so/so. I would give it 2 stars most likely if I went again and reviewed it. Clover Club is mostly ignored by that crowd, which is a shame because our brunch was amazing.\\n\\nWe popped into Clover Club for a few morning cocktails and brunch. We shared the Country Breakfast, Oysters \"Rock Your Face Off\", Baked Eggs with Chorizo and Manchego and a Brown Derby cocktail. Wow, everything was great, from flavor to presentation, it all blew us away. The Oysters were super tasty, not overly fried or greasy served on a bed of rock salt for extra flavor if you want. The sausage gravy in the Country Breakfast was amazing and the Baked Eggs worked fantastically well. Nothing was overly salty, fried, cooked, etc, just nicely done or perfect all around with fantastic flavors. My major compliant was that I didn\\'t have another stomach to order more.\\n\\nAdd all this to chill decor, a great music selection, super friendly and attentive staff and reasonable prices (for Smith Street) and you have a dynamite establishment great for any meal. Ignore Luluc and come here instead, you\\'ll be much happier.', u\"Came in for Sunday brunch today. The food was delicious and very unique. I appreciated the d\\xe9cor and the music was perfect.\\n\\nThe bloody Mary was spicy and delicious. I wish it was a bit larger haha! \\n\\nI had the croissant French toast with berries which was yummy but not very filling. \\n\\nThe potato pancakes were crispy and good, but the sauce they came with took them to a whole new level! \\n\\nBread pudding was a little sweeter than what I'm used to but solid.\", u\"I love the Clover Club. Plain and simple. The food is outstanding, particularly their flatbread, oysters, fried chicken, and beef burger (these are just the things I've had!). They have an EXTENSIVE cocktail menu, ranging in traditional, Jazz-age to their own unique pairings of liquors, fizzles, and flair. I recommend any of their gin-based drinks, such as the Clover Club, or the Gin Blossom. All cocktails are the same price, so you're aware of what you're spending from the get-go. \\n\\nThe service is delightful. Every staff member is friendly and helpful. I ordered the Gin Blossom with my dinner today. Well, they had made a bit too much of my drink, and instead of dumping the excess, brought the extra left in a chilled glass to keep it cold (they had the drink in a tiny, glass carafe inside this cup). I was pleasantly surprised and excited. The food came out promptly, and they gave us fresh napkins with each course. \\n\\nI highly recommend this shining jewel in Brooklyn. They even have live jazz on Wednesday's!\", u'A friend and I went to Clover Club while we are walking in the neighborhood, and the happy hour options here are hard to beat.\\n\\nThe full menu was very interesting, but the happy hour menu was more than enough - it came with classic drinks like an Old Fashioned or a Moscow Mule. The Old Fashioneds were particularly tasty, and hard to beat for $8 in this part of town.\\n\\nThe foods on happy hour menu were also very reasonably priced. The olives and the hanger steak were the best options.\\n\\nService was very thorough, and I felt looked after.', u'I want to start with all the pros:\\nDecor is beautiful\\nFood is interesting and delicious\\nLocation Location Location is great\\nBACON tasting was bomb- especially black pepper and maple\\nCountry breakfast bomb x 2 = I was super jealous. My husband ordered this and it took everything in me not to steal his plate. The gravy was sooooo goooood. \\n\\n\\nCONS:\\nDuck bacon was blah: As soon as I tasted the \"duck bacon\" I instantly regretted my duck hashbrown decision.\\nThat duck hashbrown has to come with a warning label. Like I couldn\\'t eat it, like I love spicy food but that chipotle aioli was everywhere and was like fire. From a scale of 1-10 it was a 15. So BUYER BEWARE. Maybe ask for the aioli on the side. I was so sad watching everyone else eat up their delicious meals. I am a firm believer in not wasting food otherwise I would have sent it back :(. I tried to flip the hashbrown and eat the side that didn\\'t have the aioli, NA that wasn\\'t helping LOL.\\n\\nYou\\'d think they know how hot that chipotle aioli is and that maybe someone would come by with water more often. We sat around with empty cups for a while. A busy brunch Saturday, I so get it. Maybe leave me a pitcher if you know we aren\\'t ordering anything but water.\\n\\nLastly we were seated next to a tipsy table of 4 and they were a little obnoxious and on their way out not big deal. But maybe it\\'s something to consider, maybe we could have been seated somewhere else. \\n\\nSo you can see my pros out weigh the cons. But for me personally I would pass on that duck hashbrown, the end.', u\"Decided to drop in here because Lulucs, next door, had a 45 minute wait. We should have just waited the 45. Service was awful. Took 10-15 minutes for my girlfriend and I to be greeted by our server and get water. Took another 15-20 to get our check and pay. Food looked amazing but wasn't very good. I order the Duck hash. Would have been ok if it wasn't smothered in hotsauce. And my pancakes weren't all that great. My girlfriend ordered croissant French toast. It tasted like a soggy croissant with strawberry's and syrup.  Won't be back again.\", u\"Hostess was very welcoming when we came in. They also did not seem to rush us out. We spent a great deal of time eating and chatting without feeling like we needed to get out. Drinks were good... the bloody Mary is spicy.\\n\\nThe food was just okay.The egg sandwich looks impressive but it's more bread than anything else. The fried chicken was juicy and slaw was good but the coating kept falling off. The potato cakes had no flavor whatsoever even with the sauce. \\n\\nI tried this place once. Happy to say that I did. But  I Won't be back.\", u\"Very classy place for a girl's night out.  That's just how we roll ;)\\n\\nService was spot on!  We had a reservation but 2 of us came early and they didn't require all 4 members of our party to be present in order to be seated at our reserved tables.  I love how they have a separate mocktails menu upon request ($6).  Cocktails are strong.  Sliders came with a side of chips.  The exposed brick wall made it feel very Brooklyn-y.  It's definitely The place to wind down with your gals and enjoy what's left of the weeknight.\", u'This is one of my favorite go to places for happy hour/brunch/apps with friends. They are never overly busy all the times I have been there so it continues to be the go to spot. They have a very good Moscow mule that comes wit candied ginger which is always a plus.  The duck fat chips and dip are the perfect bar app. The dip is like crack and I think I could put it on anything!', u\"I have seen some prior reviews about problematic service - that was most certainly not my experience - our server was great. The ambiance was great, comfortable seating, AC pumping on a hot/humid day. Great cocktail bar in an unexpected area.  We didn't eat here, but I can tell you that the food smelled really good.  I had two Michter's Rye Manhattans that were crafted perfectly.  I can be a bit of a snob when it comes to this, but I can comfortably say that the cocktails were 100% and I will be back here - and I'll get something to eat then too.  Their happy hour specials seem like a fantastic deal.  Salute!\", u\"If I could be reincarnated, it would be as a cocktail made here, living such a short life but knowing I am filling someone with amazing happiness. I've never had a disappointing cocktail here.\", u\"After a long day, we wanted to enjoy a good happy hour in the area. So glad we decided on Clover Club!\\n\\nWhen we arrived, the bar was still empty with only a few other patrons already there. There was a romantic atmosphere with mood lighting, not to mention the great mix of 70s-80s music selection. The long bar had large bar stools and there were also spacious booths/tables along the wall. We opted to sit towards the back of the bar for a more intimate happy hour vibe. \\n\\nOur bartender was very friendly and skilled at creating every concoction. I went for the Corn Whiskey Old Fashioned which was classic, well made and very enjoyable. The Moscow Mule was also amazing, especially since I don't usually go for Mules. It was served with lime and candied ginger, which added a great touch. The cocktails were only $8 for happy hour. They also have $6 wines, $4 beers, and $4-7 bar bites. You definitely can't go wrong there!\\n\\nHappy hour Monday-Friday 4-7pm. I would highly recommend it.\"], u'174.Bunker': [u'We absolutely LOVED this place. We paid a driver to take us there and it was Fabulous! The summer rolls were exceptional! We also ordered this pancake and iced coffee which we great also.\\n\\nRose and Lisa \\nFort Myers, FL', u\"Can't rate this place high enough!\\n\\nReally incredible food, a super interesting and modern twist of Vietnamese food. \\n\\nI recommend starting off with the limeade, it's a super refreshing Vietnamese drink made from salted limes. If getting an appetizer, try the beef jerk papaya salad. Delicious!\\n\\nI've been twice, once I got the lemongrass chicken banh mi, which was great and filling. The second time I got the lemongrass pork chop entree, which was incredible!\\n\\nEnd the meal with the coconut tapioca pudding, which to be honest, is the main reason I always make a trip out to Brooklyn whenever I'm in town.\", u'This restaurant is located in a very sketchy neighborhood with very little people on the streets. Look for the \"B\" sign hanging on top of the restaurant as there is no actual \"Bunker\" side in the front of the restaurant. \\n\\nAmbience - TBH, what really attracted me to this restaurant was the presentation of the food and the interior design. It was a fusion between oriental and hipster. The restaurant is decorated with so many fun colors and even has a tiki bar. It is also very spacious unlike many restaurants in NY. The vibe was chill and the music was subtle. It wasn\\'t loud that I have to yell to talk to my friend. You would not expect such a cute restaurant in the middle of nowhere. \\n\\nService - Our waiters were nice and gave suggestions on what was popular at the restaurant. Other than that, it was mediocre service.  \\n\\nFood - We got the banh xeo ($14.50) which is crispy pancakes with bacon, prawn, bean sprout, lettuce and herbs. There is also a vegetarian option. It was so delicious! You wrap the pancake inside the lettuce with mint and basil. For the main entree, I got the chicken curry ($17). The chicken was so tender and the curry sauce was flavorful. It was a bit more on the bitter side despite having coconut milk in it. My friend got the grilled lemongrass short ribs ($19) and we shared coconut tapioca pudding ($5) which was so good. It had a heavy coconut taste which I really enjoyed. Overall, the food was good however....it was the most I\\'ve paid for Vietnamese food. I am so used to the Chinatown prices. The meat is pasture raised and the eggs are cage free so those kind of justifies the more expensive prices.', u\"I have been excited for this place ever since  I watched it on Guy's Triple D's a few months ago. I finally got the chance to check it out. My impression of the restaurant was good even before I got there. I called ahead to make sure they were open late since I had a long drive and spoke to Samantha. She was courteous and friendly and was excited to have us pay a visit. I can already tell we were going to have a positive experience. \\n\\nWhen we got there, I actually thought we were at the wrong place. Bunkers was surrounded by factories and truck terminals. Honestly, there was no way I would've known of the place if I wasn't looking for it. Once inside however, you are immediately treated with an amazing, fun, hip dining space. The restaurant is a combination of a an upscale/down-home/modern bar/ with all the best elements of each. There is also an outdoor area that used to be a skate park and it's one of the coolest space I've ever seen.\\n\\nWe ordered Vietnamese pancake, pork chop with rice and turmeric fish seasoned with dill on vermicelli based on our waitress, Samantha's recommendation. The pancake was one of the crispiest I've tasted. Imagining a crackling crust outside and a softer, airy tempura texture inside, filled with pork and fresh shrimps. The pork chop with rice was equally delicious. The meat was extremely fresh and the marinate penetrated through all levels without over powering. The turmeric fish with dill especially, was a surprise hit. Crispy fish nuggets with sweet, fresh flesh inside, flavored with fried dill, adding a hint of tart and acidic after note in every bite. It is my favorite item at Bunkers now.\\n\\nWe got to meet Neo, Antonio and chef Jimmy. They are a team of successful business men who are down to earth and extremely passionate about what they do. These guys even hand-make their own decorations for the restaurant. Before our meal was finished, the kitchen sent us a complimentary dessert, rice pudding. It was a cold and cool finish to an awesome meal. The pudding was mild with fruity, fresh chunks of pineapple and jackfruits, exotic but also comforting.\\n\\nThis place is not just food, it is an experience. They even have authentic Vietnamese money on the wall. The service is excellent, the food is top notch. Come and enjoy. The items can be pricey but hey, you don't want to compromise perfection now, do you?\", u\"So my dining partner has been to the original Bun-ker location before and tells me this address is the second address, moved from the original address. This was a few years ago when Bun-ker was all the hype. I suggested the recent Dekalb Market Hall location but after some talk we ate at this 99 Scott Ave address.\\n\\nI checked it out again before visiting and thought the same a few years ago. Same-oh, so let's go. Actually...\\n\\nThe Dining Atmosphere: feels better than the pictures of the original address/location. It is more spacious, the layout more open and less shoddy seating. Each table has the famous Sriracha rooster chili sauce. A canister of forks, spoons, knives, chopsticks. After seating ourselves, a waiter immediately brings the menu, which was not on the wooden bench like tables. Waiter offers drinks and ask immediately what appetizer we'd like. It took a couple minutes to decide and he came back exactly a couple minutes later.\\n\\nAppetizer: Our trinity order included the Summer Rolls, Vegan Summer Rolls and a Bahn Xeo. The sparsely lined shrimp in the Summer Rolls (two rolls) particularly (as well as the other ingredients) were clean tasting and fresh. Actually tasted like it just came out of the fridge. Too much greens inside and all I could taste was mint and the chewiness of the rice paper wrapping. Needed the peanut sauce and sweet vinegar dip to add taste, otherwise pretty bland. I'm personally calling them Mint Rolls. The Vegan Summer Roll is the same without the cold shrimp. I liked the shiitake mushrooms in the Vegan Summer Rolls. They were flavorful.\\n\\nThe big hype of the Banh Xeo is exaggerated, highly. Yes, it is crisp and taste good but not worth the $14.50 price tag. Why? Because it's a very basic crispy pancake with no filling except a small handful of mung bean sprouts inside. I thought there would be more filling to it. I guess the details of Heritage Bacon and Wild Prawn are mixed into the shell for I could not find them inside the filling or they got really cheap and gave pea size cubes of them. Sorry, I didn't carry a microscope on me.\\n\\nI recall Bun-ker had soft shell crab on the menu, it did not. I guess it was seasonal or a specialty. I ordered the Cha Ca La Vong and thought the main part of the dish being 5 pieces of fried or fried-like catfish were fresh, soft and pretty good. The small bed of dill definitely add flavor to the vermicelli. Because without the dill, the shrimp sauce and left over peanut sauce from the appetizer the noodles on the bottom would have been bland. Pass the Sriracha sauce, please.\\n\\nThe shrimp from the Grilled Lemongrass Wild Shrimp dish were also 5 medium to slightly large shrimps or prawns that looked lightly charred but lacked flavor. And I asked my dining partner what the heck was this tiny spring roll doing in the middle of the dish looking funny in there. The menu listed it, hmmmmm. Otherwise, same accessories and bland vermicelli and leaves. That house, shrimp, peanut and sriracha sauce are well needed ecept on my catfish.\\n\\nBunker climbs to a 3.8 but doesn't reach a 4 out of 5 in my book. The reason being for positively good quality food but average in flavor. It is over-hyped and slightly over-priced.\", u\"This new location is larger, more open and fun. The dishes are amazing. Try the pork chop, or short ribs with tomato fried rice. Vegetarian and vegan options are awesome. Friendly atmosphere and hip hop playing in the background makes for a unique combination in this Vietnamese restaurant. The menu is filled with traditional style courses to enjoy. \\n\\nHands down best & most authentic Vietnamese food in NYC with an even better staff! The new space is amazing and all around great place to check out. 10/10 i would eat here every day if I lived closer. \\n\\nSimply amazing. Small menu of perfect dishes. You are not an official foodie until you eat here!\\n\\nLoved the decor and the steak salad i got was very good. The pork chop over rice with egg was amazing as well. My co worker got the beef with rice and my other co worker got the shrimp with rice. Everything dish was solid and out of this world. The only thing missing was a beer to wash everything down with. Apparently they are still waiting on their liquor license and currently don't serve alcohol.\\n\\nGreat staff willing to accommodate. Food is consistently delicious including the desert. New location is beautiful, can't wait to come back.\\n\\nDifferent Twist on Vietnamese food & wonderful atmosphere. A MUST visit spot in Brooklyn. #Brooklyn is WINING. \\n\\nMAJOR PROP'S TO THE OWNER!!\", u\"Bunker is located in an isolated area between Williamsburg and Bushwick. It was hard to find at first as the streets are occupied by factories and warehouses. Once we found the place, we  were delighted with the decor as it reminded us of Vietnam street culture. \\n\\nWe were excited about the menu as there are not many restaurants that specialize in Vietnam street cuisine. We also heard from coworkers that the place was as legit as it gets. It was about Sunday afternoon and to our surprise, the restaurant was quite empty. Perhaps we had just missed the brunch rush and was grabbing a bite too early for dinner. Our waiter was very much attentive and very helpful with the menu.\\n\\nWe ended up ordering the Heritage Pork and Wild Shrimp Spring Rolls, Grilled Lemon Grass Pork Chop and the Curry Chicken.  The Spring rolls were crispy and the lettuce wraps were a nice touch. The only issue was that the accompanying sauce was too overpowering and tasted much of fish sauce. As for the pork chop...it was absolutely perfection. The flavors, the grilling and the tenderness of the pork was exactly how it should it. Lastly, the Curry Chicken was just okay. The chicken itself was okay and the carrots were good, but the potatoes were still underdone and the texture was still a bit tough. It may have just needed to be cooked longer overall to achieve equal tenderness in the veggies and meat. \\n\\nWe were so full from the food that we didn't get a chance to order dessert. Overall, it is a pretty solid place and I would be interested to go back for drinks and try other items.\\n\\nGrade: B+\", u'Bunker carries the best Vietnamese food in town! No joke cuz Alexander Wang came here too (just saying)', u\"Authentic and delicious Vietnamese food.\\n\\nI've been to the old and new location. So happy they moved to the new bigger location. As the old place was cool but the wait was longer.\\n\\nI like sharing the appetizers with my friends and getting a main dish after.\\nI've tried the following dishes before:\\n\\nCrab Spring Rolls \\nBeef Jerky Papaya Salad \\nVietnamese Pancakes \\nShrimp and Turf Vermicelli \\nBun Cha Ha Noi\\n\\nEach dish is delicious and just like the food I had in Vietnam. Maybe just a little cleaner, half kidding :) . \\n\\nWill be back for the Pho and Banh Mi sandwiches.\", u'It was just ooooook\\n\\nI get that this place was featured on a TV show, which is great, but the food was not THAT great. I will give the place its props with its decor and interesting furniture. \\n\\nUpon looking at the menu, well the prices on the menu, I knew that I would be a little disappointed. Most of the appetizers were in the 13 dollar range, which is the price of most entrees at many \"fancy\"Vietnamese restaurants in the city. \\n\\nThe bowl of beef pho was 17 bucks and it was really bland. Honestly, I would not make the trek out here for Bunker\\'s pho, even if I lived in \"east\" Williamsburg/Ridgewood. You\\'d be better off going to Chinatown. For appetizers, we also tried the Vietnamese pancake. Our server told us it was big enough for four people. I guess he was referring to a table of four pygmies. We ended up ordering another appetizer. The \"pancake\" was really small for 13 bucks. Don\\'t not get me wrong, the pancake was good but we were expecting a little more for 13 bucks. \\n\\nThe mussels were the one thing from our dining experience that was a hit and worth the price. The mussels were AMAZING and the broth was out of this world. I would have paid two bowls of the mussels - one as an appetizer and one as the entree. Although we did not try them, the rolls looked and smelled very delicious. \\n\\nAlthough the food was a little meh, the staff was pretty cool. The members of the staff were very attentive, outgoing, and social. If you sit at the bar, you can chat a bit with the preppers. \\n\\nTo me,  this is one of those places where you can tell your \"foodie\" friends that you have tried. But for Vietnamese dining, I think that I will stick to my Chinatown and Koreatown spots.\\n\\nNote, as of march 2017, no booze is served on the premises but someone mentioned that you can BYOB.', u\"Cuisine: 7\\nService: 8\\nDecor: 8\\nValue: 6\\nOverall: 7\\n\\nBeen to the old spot over a dozen times and now for the first time at the new location. Food is always consistently good, but the price is definitely not your average Vietnamese restaurant. We get a huge discount because my best friend is related to one of the owners and it's still not cheap.\\n\\nFirst of all, if you thought the old location in Ridgewood was desolate. Wait till you see the new spot situated between all sorts of industrial factories. Since there is no such thing as foot traffic here, Bunker relies heavily on word of mouth and loyal customers. As for the interior, the design is meant to transport you to an outdoor restaurant/bar in tropical Vietnam ... ... I think they got the message across.\\n\\nSecondly, Bunker, please bring back the Crab Spring Rolls, Crab Fried Rice and the Coconut Pork Spare Ribs. They were some of your finest dishes that brought us back to middle of nowhere over and over again. Unfortunately, those were the dishes that would have earned you a five star review.\\n\\nAnyway, here is what we did have on the visit. Quite a bit of food for five people, wouldn't you say?\\n\\nSpring Rolls - crunchy rather than crispy\\nBeef Jerky Papaya Salad - not a good pairing\\nVietnamese Pancake - always done very well\\nMussels - a but puny, but sauce is excellent\\nGrilled Pork Skewers - fun to eat, taste great too\\nFried Fish Banh Mi - way better than McD's\\nBeef Noodle Soup - flavorful and delicious\\nPastured Chicken Curry - I have had better\\nCaramelized Wild Shrimp - fantastic addition\\nLamb Stew - consensus group favorite, must try\\nSauteed Water Spinach - nice little veggie dish\\nMushroom Fried Rice - too wet, bring back crab\\n\\nIf you are wondering, there was no room for desserts. Though the Iced Coffee was delicious, albeit small.\\n\\nThe servers here are very friendly and helpful. At times, they could be a bit too busy with other tables, but generally it didn't bother us.\\n\\nI really hope they get back to their roots and bring back some classic dishes from the original location. Even better, dig deeper and revive old recipes like the Stuffed Chicken Wings from Chef Jimmy's old days running Tigerland in Alphabet City. Honestly, a little bit disappointed in the first meal at this new location. However, that's due to the extremely high bar they had set in the past. Can't wait till next time.\", u\"Hrmmmm I don't know what I missed but I've tried a variety of dishes here at Bunker and was very underwhelmed. The pancakes dish was whatevs. The various noodle soups were equally bland. On top of that, the food took a really long time to come out. Not quite sure what the hold-up was. At least the kitschy decorations made for something interesting to look at, because I definitely wasn't interested in the food.\\n\\nBunker really is in the middle of nowhere, I ended up biking here with my friend, and feel like that's probably the most efficient way getting to Bunker. There's an area you can lock up your bike near the entrance. Taking everything into account, still not quite sure what the Bunker hype is all about :/\", u'We tried the pho at the DeKalb location and they were tasty and hot. Just the right size for lunch. We will definitely go back to try other offerings.', u\"Love the space! It's an interesting Vietnamese restaurant-bar with skater vibes and eclectic furnishings. Check out the geckos on the wall - made me feel right at home. Don't worry, they're not real.\\n\\nWe had the Vietnamese spring rolls and 2 different types of noodles here. The food is pretty decent, though I found it lacking in the strong, pungent flavours I usually associate with Vietnamese food. But I definitely still enjoyed it. :)\", u\"The short: Nice looking venue, service was slow, food was average.\\n\\nThe long: we arrived as a group around 8pm on Sunday night. It took about ten minutes for the waitress to take our order.\\n\\nThe starters (summer rolls - $10 and bang xeo (Vietnamese pancake) - $14.50 came out reasonably quick. Both tasted fine and were on par with most Vietnamese affairs.\\n\\nThe mains arrived 25 minutes after that. We kept craneing our necks waiting for the food to arrive. \\n\\nPho beef noodles -$17 - very bland. Did not have any hint of star anise or other flavours you'd expect at a regular Vietnamese restaurant. Also had to request hoisin sauce which was not particular flavourful. The bowl was much smaller than I was expecting given the $17 price tag.\\n\\nChicken curry and ride - $(can't remember) - more success with this dish. Didn't blow our socks off but was tasty.\\n\\nGrilled beef banh mi - $13 - was decent. Wasn't as flavourful as Vietnamese cafes specialising in banh mi, but no complaints.\\n\\nThe setting itself is quite nice with a skater quarterpipe in the outdoor seating, but I don't think I'd return for the food.\", u\"Saw this restaurant on DDD and I take Mr. Fieri on his word to try different cuisines. The location could be a bit hard to find if you are not familiar with the industrial area in Williamsburg and it's kind of hidden even as you pull up. Having said that, it has a cool retro vibe when you walk in. An old commercial warehouse renovate with an eclectic style. Different, fun, trendy and posh mixed together.\\n\\nThe menu had a lot of great flavorful mixed. I found myself agonizing what to order because I wanted to try everything however I stuck to the basics. I ordered the Banh Xeo Chay (vegan Vietnamese pancake). It was really tasty and the mix of basil/mint and fish vinegarette made for a unique taste to my palet. I enjoyed this simple dish.\\n\\nFor the entree I ordered the staple dish- The grilled lemongrass pork chop. It was delicious and so soft I could cut it with a knife. Vietnamese restaurants are known for their thin style pork chops and this place was spot on. I loved the fried egg over the rice. My wife ordered a side of the grilled eggplant it was phenomenal with the shallots on top. I was impressed with all of those items. The only letdown was the shaking beef my wife ordered because some of the meat was chewy and the dish just didn't have as much flavor and style as the others. For dessert we had the coconut pudding which came with jackfruit and monk fruit. Really delicious but a tad too sweet for me (my wife loved it).\\n\\nService was friendly, fast and had great knowledge of the dishes. He made ordering a pleasure with recommendations. I will be coming back to visit sometime soon and if your on the fence about trying something different then let your inhibitions go and give this place a chance.\", u'oh yeah, i had a good lunch here, not cheap but really good pho, one of the best i can remember, love the large space with almost no costumers at 12pm. only 4 stars because i only had a soup but i will be back and probably upgrade to 5', u'Came here with two girlfriends for a very low key lunch on Saturday. Don\\'t get mixed up! This is NOT the old location which was more or less in the middle of a dusty, industrial dead-zone. Place is W-burg/Buschwicky, with a very cool vibe, cool music, people and ton of eclectic space. Service is a bit on the slower side but fine since we were catching up over brunch for a couple of hours. \\n\\nI went to Vietnam on my recent honeymoon, so had very high expectations for Vietnamese. Generally speaking, it\\'s pretty bad in NY due to the lack of real-deal Vietnamese. So when I do get decent Vietnamese, feel like my requirements are a bit lowers. Bunker is quite food bu a bit pricey as it\\'s been said with mains being $15+. Banh Mis are cheapers around $12+.. \\n\\nBunker is really great on some dishes. i.e. the Banh Xeo (pancake) with pork belly was very delicious- fresh, not oily ($13). That was a 5 star. My Vietnamese coffee was also very good - sweet, but lacked a bit of strength in flavor ($5).  I think what was my least favorite was my main the bun cha. Good noodles, good pork. Could have had a crispier springroll, and more chopped up/easier to eat sausage and wish they hadn\\'t used so much pork belly. The vermicelli noodles and pickled veggies themselves didn\\'t come together as well as I\\'d like and if this makes sense..it was not that...Asian-y. i.e.They could have used better herb than just carrots and the link. \\n\\nOne of my friend dining with us ordered the catfish vermicelli dish which honestly looks really good, so I\\'d get that if I came back.  My other had the pho, I forget which one but she said it was just ok. Not a huge pho fan in general, I could see how it\\'s kinda meh based on what else they have... the flavor was good and tarte here. But I\\'d recommend a bun or anything more accessible only in Vietnam. \\n\\nMy bun cha was $17k -  steep but I guess it\\'s a \"Asian spot with ambiance.\"', u\"Major props to the owners of Bunker, a Vietnamese family who knows exactly how to sell authentic food to Bushwick hipsters. Take a limited selection of Vietnamese classics, double the prices, add a colorful interior to a former warehouse, blast Drake and ironic 90's rap, and you have the perfect formula for a wildly successful restaurant in Brooklyn. The menu is classic Vietnamese (Pho, Bahn Mi, curry, etc), with a vegan option in nearly every category. No beer or wine, no BYOB (they should really change this, considering the neighborhood demographic). Our waitress, a thin blonde lady in a halter top, was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.\\n\\nThe prices at Bunker are the highest I have ever seen at a Vietnamese restaurant ($17 Pho, $13 Bahn Mi, etc). That being said, the food is fantastic. The Vegan Summer Rolls ($8) were delicious-fresh mushrooms, lettuce, and perfectly cooked vermicelli wrapped in buttery soft rice paper. My boyfriend and I ordered the Com Chien Chay (Mushroom Fried Rice) to share, which we assumed would be family size, priced at $15. It wasn't. The dish was intensely flavorful without being too oily-dark caramelized soy with hints of bright lemongrass, studded with a variety of juicy mushrooms. Every bite was delicious, but I still felt a little stupid paying $15 for a cup of rice. My friends had the Fish Bahn Mi and Vegan Pho, which they raved about. Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience here and feel Bunker is worth trying, but could potentially be disappointing for traditional Vietnamese food enthusiasts.\", u'I\\'ve been meaning to get to their new space for awhile now, and finally made it there last night. the food was better than ever...and I\\'m kicking myself for waiting so long to go back. I even got an acknowledgement from our familiar-face waiter of \"welcome back\".\\n\\nwe started with their special mussels in a coconut lemongrass \"juice\" (which was so good, we didn\\'t want to let it go...we put the extra juice on everything that came after)...and their standard BanhXeo (Vietnamese pancake) which is ALWAYS a favorite. \\n\\nthen for our entrees we had the \"surf and turf\" (shrimp, short ribs, vermicelli) and grilled lemongrass pork chops (with rice and over-easy egg on top...possibly their most media focused dish). \\n\\nand we of course had to finish with a bowl of coconut tapioca. \\n\\neverything was just so yummy and perfect cooked...I didn\\'t want to stop. \\n\\nthe space is a huge improvement than before (although a TAD difficult to find the first time). and my OLD (and only) complaint of \"it was good, but I would\\'ve liked a LITTLE more\" has been fixed as the portions seemed better. \\n\\noverall it was great meal. I kept saying that it was probably the \"best meal I\\'ve had in awhile\" and twelve hours later, I can\\'t wait to back.  thanks bun-ker.'], u'162.Cheryl\\u2019s Global Soul': [u\"This is the place to go to when you wake up craving a 'real' breakfast but either don't have all the ingredients or the energy to do so for yourself. Everything tasted so good and real. \\n\\nThe pancakes were not the prettiest but they were fluffy and deliciously topped with homemade whip cream then drizzle with Nutella. Almost everyone in my group ordered the same thing for brunch... Pancakes and eggs... And everyone was satisfied. My best friend and Babes had the salmon hash which they both found to be pretty tasty.\\n\\nThe meal was good and at a good price. I didn't like waiting around on the sidewalk with my group of 6, we should have been able to make reservations. Nonetheless, I will be back with Babes.\", u'Very yummy and live music. We loved it!\\n\\nWe had the Tamarind chicken, the fried catfish and calamari. It was all gray and the half chicken was soooo much food. \\n\\nTo top it all off Cheryl and our daughter became friends.', u\"Went to Cheryl's at around 8 on a Saturday night with a group of 5 people. We had called about 30 minutes before to ask for availability, and when we arrived they had a great table in the corner ready for us! \\n\\nThe service was great, and the atmosphere inside was really cozy. Not too loud, so it was easy to have conversations, and the drinks never stayed empty for long. \\n\\nThe food was absolutely delicious, and definitely a place you'll want to visit twice so you can try different items. I personally had the catfish with mac n cheese and greens, which were very well cooked. Not the BEST catfish I've ever had, but it was definitely well done. My tablemates had the Scallops, BBQ Salmon, Shrimp, and Lamb Chops. All were very happy, but the best dish of the table probably had to be the Scallop dish. \\n\\nWe will be back!\", u\"Great food. Great service. This is my second time at Cheryl's the first time I honestly didn't eat much so I didn't want to give a review on a restaurant based off a small appetizer. This time I went from brunch the food was great I order a crispy chicken sandwich. I appreciated that my bun was toasted perfectly and the bottom was not soggy at all. Great flavor I order mines with the chipotle mayo. My friends order was bigger than mine but he ate so fast I can't remember everything he had but there was no complaints regarding the food. Four stars because on two separate occasions we were told something we order was not on the menu and I order a tea that I didn't receive in a timely fashion so I just asked another employee to please cancel it for me.\", u'The food was okay, but the server was so unapologetically rude that I can\\'t imagine returning. When I asked to speak with someone who might redress the harm, I was told \"he\\'s normally a nice guy. You should contact the owner\". I left here feeling so disrespected.', u'If I could go to this spot every weekend I would. People friendly (2 yrs old included), excellent menu, ambiance, everything.  Thumbs up up up!!', u'So rude is the waitress! Never met any like this in NYC before! Never gonna be back for sure! The good mood disappears bc this rudeness!', u\"2 stars for food: 1 extra star bc of service...\\nPopped in for a late solo brunch on Sunday. Pro: brunch entrees come with coffee and a mimosa; mimosa was better than I expected...not the freshest, most orange OJ, but decent champagne. Cons: food - at least what I orderedo - was not great. I ordered the poached eggs over salmon hash and was shocked when the dish came out. I expected flecks of smoked (or fully cooked) salmon with potatoes. Instead I got canned salmon...mashed, with a few potatoes tossed in...WOW! II was too hungry to send it back and just ate it. Eggs were good...salmon has was disgusting. I'm giving this place 3 stars ONLY because the service was good (and partly because I looked around and saw other dishes that looked appealing (key word: looked).\", u\"My all time favorite restaurant for brunch... Absolute best in Brooklyn! The pancakes are simply made with LOVE, and the staff is as friendly as can be (hey Caroline!). I've been coming here for more than 5 years, and I've never been disappointed. During the summertime, they open their backyard/garden and it's just lovely with a group of friends. Oh yea, and I only bring my favorite people here; it's that special to me.\", u\"Cute little spot near the Brooklyn Library with some tables on the side and a small bar at the back. Came here around 1pm for Sunday brunch. Was worried I'd wait long but I guess I was lucky that day since we sat right away. \\n\\nSat at the bar (small space but 2 people can sit there comfortably and eat). Glad I sat by the bar that cold day, the bartender told us the heat hits the bar first, so I was warm and toasty! \\n\\nBrunch meals comes with mimosa AND tea/coffee. Whoop whoop! The homemade whipped cream on the mixed berry pancakes was EVERYTHING! I ordered extra bacon since I was missing bacon from a previous meal that week. Glad I did! Perfectly done, extra crispy and complemented well with the rest of the food. You can't go wrong with extra bacon!\", u'Super friendly locals spot. Family restaurant to the max....lots of well behaved kids. They have inexpensive prix fixe breakfasts with my favorite touch: orange juice included. OJ is inexpensive, but too many places use it to jack the profits. Restaurants that hydrate their guests are restaurants who actually care about their guests in my book.', u\"I really liked this cozy place near prospect park. The place is small and the decoration is really nice. We went for brunch on Thursday and it wasn't full, but during the weekend is very crowded. The brunch dishes are delicious, I ordered the spinach omelette and it was really good!\", u'This spot reminds me of a very cool friend who used to suggest it for brunch (conveniently right next to her apartment). Everything here is delicious. I have been here for brunch, dinner, for brunch with 1 friend and with a big group and every time the service is great and the food excellent. Very warm and comfortable decor and just an all around wonderful meal.', u'So i came here for brunch/ breakfast. It was a 20 minute wait. Seems like the normal wait time. The pancakes was good fluffy and hit the spot. I got the pancake with mixed berreis. I got a side order of salmon hash browns whixh is just home fries with salmon mixed up. And i got a ordered of scramble eggs. The wine orange juice was good. Forgot exaclty what they call it. The waiter had good customer service. However he  made me uncomfortable with his femine ways. Wanted to leave because he gona rub my back. Smh the people who i was with insisted that we stay and ignore it. Overall food was good environment and atmosphere was nice', u'It\\'s a good idea to call ahead before coming. Already heading over we knew there was no room in the garden but still space inside. I came here at about 11 for brunch on sunday. \\nThe food was not very \"soul\" but it was good nonetheless so I didn\\'t particularly mind. I got the Chloe: a warm sandwich with brie, apple, jam, and baby arugula. The brie was melty and tasted great with something sweet: the apple and jam. I also ordered a lemon poppy seed scone because I couldn\\'t resist a fresh baked good! The scone came warm and soft. As we continued to eat it started to fill up fast so 11 was a good time to come.', u'Very global, not enough Soul.  I would probably give them 4 stars if they did not call this a \"soul food\" restaurant.  I came in for brunch with my girlfriend one Saturday afternoon.  I had been meaning to try them out for brunch but I\\'ve shied away because \"bottomless mimosas\" are my prerequisite to choosing a location for brunch, but this particular weekend I decided that I\\'d like to still be coherent after my meal.  I have to say that the French Toast is delicious!  I highly recommend it.  We came for pancakes that my girlfriend assured me were top notch.  She ordered them and they were quite bland and very bready (this is a yelp review so \"bready\" can be a real word).  The flavor that she was raving about just wasn\\'t there.  Additionally, we got sides of eggs and breakfast potatoes.  They were so drab.  The eggs were simply thin scrambled eggs with no seasoning and NO SOUL.  The potatoes were cute little squares with maybe some onion and red pepper very loosely diced into the oily potatoes with NO SOUL!!!  You can\\'t call this a soul food restaurant with food that palettes this poorly.  Maybe it was an off day because some other yelpers whom I trust give this place high marks but I was rather underwhelmed.  I see glimmers of hope of this place and it probably is better at other times but this wasn\\'t my experience minus the lovely French toast.  Additionally, the one mimosa that came with the meal was very good (I downed it in 4 sips, because I\\'m a brunch savage).  It\\'s nice that your brunch also comes with a free coffee or tea as well so the tea got me through the remainder of the meal.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, try it because your friends want you to, but don\\'t expect soul food...it\\'s just Food.', u\"The brunch menu is light on options if you don't want dessert for brunch.  The food was pretty mediocre, and we didn't get a drink we ordered\", u'This place is Awesome! Everything was delicious (We had Thai curry mussels, Stilton salad, blackened catfish, & creole shrimp). Also the service was very friendly & the garden seating is beautiful. We arrived 5 minutes before happy hour ended and the server was happy to offer us the reduce prices. Both house cocktails were yum. My new fav place!', u\"Good, simple and cheap food. Gotta find out was brand of sausage they gave me so I order a box or five.  I was only given one, split in half but I'm cutting back anyway so no need to complain. Great staff, good decor and food. Homefries were divine, restaurants and diners just don't do them justice like they should. And how can you mess up homefries, it's onions, sweet peppers and s&p for the more basic recipes?!?! I will be back, maybe for lunch next time.\", u\"We had the worst experiance in this place!\\nWe had to wait an hour and a half for the food, and the drinks also took a really long time to get to us. One of us had a hair in his food... One got a cold burger... And the fries were soft and full of oil. \\nWhen we tried to talk to the waiter about it he walked away on us and was very rude. \\nThey also wanted to include a 20% tip in the check... But we made them cancel it after all that's happened.\\nI'm never coming back to thia place.\"], u'142.Buntopia': [u\"I spilled ramen all over myself and they gave me a new one for no charge\\n\\nThe food is great I'll be back\", u\"I can't speak on the rest of the food items so I don't want to rank too hard here, but, the ramen was sub par.\\nI felt bad because my out of town guests came with me as I had been wanting to try the place. Come to find out, it was their first time ever having ramen in a restaurant. \\nI have a friend who has tried the sushi and other items and I hear those are great. I will return to try other items because otherwise it was great service and a chill atmosphere.\", u\"It's amazing how fast and fresh food can come out that looks PICTURE PERFECT and tastes just as well. We inhaled our umami piggy scallion pancake wraps and oyster bay buns.\\n\\n+ Fast, friendly service\\n+ Solid price (no table service, they encourage you to clean up after yourselves)\\n+ Flavorful and fresh Asian flavors and ingredients\\n+ Cute and neat presentation\\n+ Clean and spacious atmosphere\\n+ Yum, yum, yum\", u\"Buntopia is great for when you don't know what you're in the mood to eat. On top of ramen, sushi, pork buns, they've also got acai bowls and other small apps. Their fruit smoothies are great (a little on the pricier side but always refreshing.) Lots of veg options! I highly recommend the vegan nugget ramen. Their broth for the non-veg ramen bowls isn't like most ramen places (if you've ever had tom yum soup, think of that.) Service is always good. You order up front. Good amount of seating.\", u'The zesty green roll was bomb. Love how they have a lot of pictures  of menu  items. Also had Char Siu Ramen, they had a good balance  of meat veggies  and noodles  in my bowl. I just wished it had a little more flavor. But overall  it was a bowl of amazingness.', u'Living next door to this place, it seemed foolish not to go in and try out. \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I had just been off to do an early morning food shop at the local supermarch\\xe9t - it was super bowl Sunday, and we were on wings and dip duty, you see. Just as we got back to my place, my girlfriend said \"how about a breakfast smoothie?\". \"Go on then, it is Sunday after all\" I replied, throwing caution to the wind.\\n\\nWe got ourselves an Acai Smoothie and a Pina Colada smoothie - both were delicious and made with fresh ingredients. So much so, I could hear the tropical waves crashing as the fruit was flung around the blender. Needless to say, we both left as VERY satisfied customers.\\n\\nBuntopia, I will be back. And I will be eating everything you have on the menu. I\\'ll give you at least 48hrs notice so you have time to stock.\\n\\nTLDR;\\nGreat smoothies\\nFresh ingredients\\nNice interior\\nWill be back to try food', u'Finally a place that is healthyish, delicious, and reasonably priced. I had the shrimptation, the zesty green, and the tom Kai ramen.  All were amazing. Make sure to get those with the lingonberry hoisen sauce. Also the service is great and they have a nice peaceful backyard. Came here hungover and was happy not to have to deal with a chaotic experience.', u'Do not come here for Ramen.\\n\\nThis is the worst ramen I have ever had, and that\\'s saying a lot. The broth is bland, with virtually no flavor. The eggs are fully hardboiled, not marinated at all. The pork is hard. There are some unique ingredients (crabmeat, enoki mushrooms. etc.), but they don\\'t save it.\\n\\nIt looks nothing like the pictures on the website, whatsoever.  Pictured on the site are soft-boiled, marinated eggs, a rich broth, etc.  This was nothing of the sort. \\n\\nThe customer service... they need to get it together on that end, too.\\n\\nThey have a juice bar, but refuse to let you choose your own ingredients. They said it was because they were \"too busy\" - but I was *literally* the only person in the restaurant when I came in. Not figuratively. Literally. There wasn\\'t a single other customer there (I wonder why... -_-).\\n\\nMoreover, they were extremely stingy with their condiments. They wouldn\\'t let me take more than a dash or two of the chili powder to use in my ramen.\\n\\nIf I hadn\\'t had some of my own cayenne pepper and soy sauce at home to at least give it *some* flavor, I wouldn\\'t have been able to eat it at all.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIt\\'s a shame - I really wanted to like this place.  I was so excited to have a ramen place down the block, that was also a juice bar and had a bunch of really neat looking, interesting culinary creations.\\n\\nBut, while the bun I tried was okay,  the ramen is awful.  The customer service is lacking.\\n\\nI might try it again after it\\'s been open a few months, but for now avoid this place.\\n\\n---\\n\\nEDIT: Given the response from the restaurant here, I will not be giving them another go.', u\"** Review for smoothies only **\\n\\nWas really pleased to see a healthy Asian place open up near my apartment - the beauty of living in the ever so up and coming Bushwick! I'd been eyeing up the menu for few weeks and it's nice to see such a variety and nothing is priced over $12.\\n\\nSo I eventually wandered in this morning for a health breakfast and I went for the Pina Colada smoothie and my BF, the Acai berry smoothie. Both super fresh, tasty and also filling! The other smoothie varieties they had also looked good. \\n\\nI look forward to coming back soon to try the food! Good work Buntopia!\", u\"We came here because of the awesome reviews and it lived up to the hype! We ordered Char Siu Ramen, Chicken Katsu Bowl, and their summertime Watermelon Smoothie! The entrees were satisfying and the flavors were refreshingly subtle nothing was overbearing. We walked out today feeling content with the generous servings but not over fed which was a nice change from some of the other restaurants we've been to. Spacious seating and warm music helped to create a comfortable environment! Highly recommend! Hurry in and try the Watermelon smoothie before summer is up!\", u'So exciting to see places like this open in the neighborhood! Very clean and inviting environment for a quick bite.\\nMy boyfriend and I had the salmon bowl with wild rice and the bao mao (although a little too sweet for me)Food was served super fast and delicious. Definitely coming back for more!', u'Live close by and have been wanting so stop by. Came in on a Sunday at 8:30pm, they close at 10pm. Nice!!\\n\\nThe cashier was super nice and friendly! My friend and I got the oyster bun (favorite thing I got), Rocky roll (was okay, not as spicy as I thought), Omega roll (wouldnt order again), Something piggy wrap (did not like at all, did not like the flavor combos) was $34, which I think is a reasonable price\\n\\nAlso--their wasabi was pre packaged and was a dark green, did not like that and wonder why they cant use fresh wasabi. \\n\\nAll in all it was a good experience, wont be back but happy we checked it out!!', u'Came up on this place by accident. It was a quick and healthy meal! Had 2 sushi rolls, a seitan bun and the watermelon smoothie. So delicious and pretty satisfied after splitting it with my boyfriend. It was very clean and inviting in the restaurant, I would definitely come back again!', u\"Accessible location.\\nClean, bright, and very inviting.\\nSeating/concept is nice.\\nDiverse mix on the menu, and very fairly prices.\\n\\nOnly thing that stopped me from giving five stars was that i didn't try enough of the food items.\\nI tried the fried oyster bun, and also the shrimp tempura bun.\\nWas really yummy and i will definitely be back for more !!\", u'This place is great but like $12 card minimum? That is so obnoxious especially for this neighborhood sorry!', u\"Ordered the Omega OMG roll, sweet potato fries, Umami Piggy scallion pancake wrap, and the original acai bowl. \\nOMG roll: Didn't go OMG for this. The flavors didn't go well together. \\nSweet potato fries: Loved it with the Himalayan salt they sprinkled on the fries. Dipped it with sriracha and mhhhh so good. \\nUmami wrap: This. Was. Amazing. Order it. Do it. The flavors go so well together and the pancake was a great alternative to the typical tortilla wrap. \\nAcai bowl: This was good but not great. Perhaps honey and coconut shavings would bring this to another level.\", u\"Food is good quality.  I've had a rice bowl and some ramen here.\\n\\nI just wish they'd change the music away from the lowest common denominator classic rock playlist.  And it would be great if they could actually pay for a music streaming service so their customers didn't get blasted with ads while they're eating.\", u'Cute place in Brooklyn that has buns, ramen, noodle soups, and freshly pressed juices! Came in with a group of 5, everyone enjoyed their food and we stayed a while to chat. I had the Aloha Bun, which was delicious (loved the pineapple), and a Pro-Green(?) juice. Loved it!', u\"Not too shabby! I consider it to be a fast food version of Ramen. You order at a counter and you clean up after yourself. I had the shrimp buns and they were AMAZING! I probably should have ordered two servings. I had the chicken ramen and it was just okay. I was disappointed that it wasn't as spicy as I would have liked. When I initially ordered it the girl at the counter told me I couldn't ask for extra spicy since it's already spicy... def was NOT spicy! Will return again if I'm in the neighborhood but won't go out of my way to eat here.\", u\"Nice clean space and friendly service. Definitely check out if you're in the area. The tom yum Kai is gray on a cold day and the golden surfer wrap was delicious and filling as well. Ordered the spicy girl as well. It wasn't bad but nothing special.\"], u'111.il Fornetto': [u\"Gorgeous views of the bay, a contained menu, and strong wine options recommend this il Fornetto. Most recently, on my second visiti, we celebrated Father's Day with a lunch. \\n\\nThe starters, including fried calamari, grilled octopus, and burrata, were all solid. My mom was not crazy about the lobster bisque but she might have been expecting more lobster chunks, which isn't really what bisque is. I had the Rigatoni e Gamberi for my main (short rigatoni, aut\\xe9ed shrimp, vodka cream sauce, chiffonade spinach). Medium portion and nicely al dente. \\n\\nThey had dinner menu prices but it was Father's Day, after all. And, to be fair, an uplift is reasonable considering the views.\\n\\nI had wanted a bottle of Primitivo but they sold me on a really nice Tuscan Chianti (a 2015 Piccini DOCG). Not sure if they were just trying to move their stock, but it was really good! \\n\\nA really nice choice on the Bay for nearly any occasion. (PS: They have complimnetary valet parking, which is a plus in the area.)\", u\"Great view of the bay, great service, but disappointing food.\\n\\nHaving lived in Sheepshead Bay a majority of my life, I had put off going to il Fornetto for the longest. I had read reviews about its fantastic view along the bay, but didn't hear much about the food, which did not surprise me after my time here.\\n\\nWe came here with family on a Friday evening at 7pm and the restaurant wasn't packed, but there were a few tables occupied. The service throughout the evening was superb as the waiters were nice, the food came out quickly and everyone working there was very professional.\\n\\nOur table ordered a number of items, which included the following.\\n\\nCOLD ANTIPASTO - prosciutto, capocollo, fresh mozzarella, grana cheese, olives, roasted peppers\\nCOZZE - pot of saut\\xe9ed Prince Edward Island mussels\\nCALAMARI FRITTI - fried domestic calamari, spicy red sauce\\nFETTUCINE BOLOGNESE - traditional beef and veal meat sauce, ricotta\\nRISOTTO PESCATORE - arborio rice, shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari, tomato\\nPARMIGIANA - breaded chicken cutlet, fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce, penne pasta\\nPENNE FORNETTO - baked penne, radicchio, bacon, fresh mozzarella, tomato cream sauce\\nDELIZIE - 1/2 fresh lobster, shrimp, clams, mussels, tomato sauce, linguine\\n\\nI won't comment on every single item, but I will comment on the dishes that stood out, positively and negatively. The dishes that were average to good included the Fettucine Bolognese, Parmigiana and Penne Fornetto. The cutlet in the Parmigiana was cooked well and tasty. As for the Penne Fornetto, we absolutely loved the little pieces of bacon scattered around. None of the actual pasta really stood out on those 3 dishes, but they were OK. I felt they were cooked a bit too long for my liking.\\n\\nAs for the really disappointing dish, it was the Risotto Pescatore. I'm a huge risotto fan and order it in many restaurants. I hate to say this, but this was probably the worst risotto I had ever had at any restaurant. It was tough to call this dish risotto as it was so watery. Not enough time was spent having the rice soak up the liquids in the entr\\xe9e. In addition, there was no flavor in the risotto. \\n\\nThe food was not just not up to standard at il Fornetto. None of the appetizers or entrees stood out to us. The pasta was just OK and the risotto should be removed from the menu. On the bright side, the view of Sheepshead Bay was amazing and the service was excellent. If you plan on visiting, just beware that you're really paying for a great view with sub-par food.\", u'Dear managers,\\n\\nI have contacted you twice via the Comment form on your website, both on Sunday afternoon and to follow up on Tuesday. I would greatly appreciate a response to the email I address that I provided in my note. Thank you.', u'il Fornetto was a surprise to say the least. I had pretty low expectations but I was really happy. My boyfriend and I decided that we needed lobster in our belly for dinner so we headed there. Mainly, the view got me. We went around 7:30 ish and the sun was setting. Truly beautiful. We ordered mozzarella corrozza which is fried mozzarella- delicious and their marinara was delicious. \\n\\nWe ordered a salad with avocado hearts of palm and it was meh. Felt like they emptied a bag of mix from the supermarket and tossed it. Would pass on this. \\n\\nThe main dish we shared was the big pasta dish. (Shrimp, 1/2 lobster, clams and mussels with marinara and linguine)... 32 dollars and delicious. \\nWould order that again. It satisfied both my boyfriend and I. \\n\\nThe service was 3/5. Could be improved.', u\"Came here for a Saturday night dinner. Parking around the area did require a bit of searching, but they have valet parking available. \\n\\nRestaurant is pretty spacious and there wasn't a wait for a table for 2. We didn't get a table by the windows, but I can imagine that the view of the water must be beautiful. \\n\\nWe tried ordering mussels for appetizer but they didn't have them in stock. We decided to just skip to entrees. I ordered the Rigatoni e Gamberi, which was good - I'm a fan of vodka cream sauce and the shrimp was tasty. It was pretty filling so my fianc\\xe9 happily finished almost half of it. He also ordered the Atlantic Salmon Oreganata, which he said was perfectly baked in breadcrumbs. \\n\\nService was friendly and helpful. Would love to return here again especially in the warmer weather when we can enjoy a view of the water in daylight.\", u\"Came here for brunch with my family. I really hope the dinner is better because the brunch was almost awful compared with most brunch places I have been to.\\n\\nAtmosphere: 5 stars\\n\\nthe setting is very nice. There's a patio area overlooking sheepshead. \\n\\nDrinks: 0 stars \\n\\nDon't order the Peach Bellini. The menu said there is white peach pur\\xe9e in the Bellini but it is a lie. This is not deceptive but a flat out lie.\\n\\nFood: 2 stars\\n\\nFrench toast was okay, but the presentation was nice.\\n\\nFrittata is dry on the inside. Fell flat completely for me. Honestly I didn't taste any mozzarella in here.\\n\\nFlorentine omelette was nicely made however. \\n\\nService: 4 stars \\n\\nThe service was nice here.\", u\"Local ital. rest. been around for 15 years. Ole' folks make me order in here or there.\", u\"Food was amazing only thing they gave me a meal with pork. I don't eat pork. The waiter didn't know it had pork in it.   He said the chef didn't write it has pork in it. So I will only give 3 stars \\u200d \\u200d\", u'The food was delicious. Looking at the menu the food is $$$ but this restaurant has a lunch and dinner prix fix menu. We went for the prix fix menu.', u\"I went here in the summer and couldn't figure out the name until now because I couldn't stop thinking about how great the food and view was. The breeze was coming in and just made the atmosphere so light and happy. The waiters were all super nice and seemed to genuinely enjoy working there. Definitely going back there soon!\", u\"During the summer time they have beautiful terrace outside. In the winter time you can enjoy view to the canal from inside. Waiters are polite and understanding, our orders was made pretty fast, we didn't even have chance to finish appetizers. I ordered grilled salmon, it was a little bit salty for me,but everything else was on the high level.\", u'I don\\'t write reviews often and usually when I do it\\'s because I had a truly stellar experience. This is not the case. I\\'m so thoroughly disappointed and disgusted right now it\\'s hard to find the words. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I came here to celebrate, to have a special night out, and it was one of the worst experiences I\\'ve had at a restaurant in my life. \\n1. I asked the waiter who took our drink orders to substitute the vodka in my cocktail for gin.... he looked at me like I had three heads. I\\'m not sure if it was a language barrier issue or what but what I got was a lackluster cocktail with watered down vodka. I thought maybe my taste buds were off so I had my boyfriend, a former bartender, taste it; it was definitely watered down vodka and not gin. \\nTo top it all off at the end of the meal when I was so fed up I figured alcohol could maybe boost the mood and went to drink this ridiculousness I noticed there was LIPSTICK ON THE GLASS!!!! \\n( thankfully I had sipped from the straw but the glass when I first tried it, otherwise I honestly might have vomited. ) \\n\\n2. Asked the waiter for capers on the roasted red peppers in the appetizers.... they charge extra for capers! And then he forgot to bring them altogether and I had to ask another waiter to do so. Minor issue but still, for their prices it\\'s unacceptable. \\n\\n3. My water glass STUCK TO THE TABLE. Not because it was wet and got slightly suctioned. It was stuck to the point where I was afraid if I pull any harder I might rip the paper cover on the table or spill the water. Realized this when I went to grab a sip of water after realizing there was lipstick on the cocktail glass. \\n\\n4. Boyfriend ordered a side of spinach with his meal, it didn\\'t come. ( come to think of it, this might be a saving grace. Hmmmm....)\\n\\n5. I ended up not ordering an entree because by the time we got the appetizer I already had a bad taste in my mouth about this place. Shared my boyfriend\\'s veal scaloppini..... had to fight over the last bite. As in which one of us would suffer through it and finish the meal so it wouldn\\'t feel like too much of a waste. He \" won \"......\\n\\n\\nSpoke to the waiter. Spoke to the manager. Their compensation? They removed my cocktail from the bill. :-/ \\n\\nWe paid the bill and went directly across the street to ROLL N ROASTER. Boyfriend got a decent meal, I shared his apple pie ( so good! ), I got a Diet Coke to try and clear my mouth of the bad taste left behind from this place. Paid half as much for twice as much ( and better ) food and better service. \\n\\nDon\\'t know if it was just an off night but I\\'ll never know now.... because I\\'m never coming back. Gross.', u\"Very cozy Italian spot right by the water. They have window views of the bay, and the sight is even more romantic at night when you see the little sailboats sailing by and all the lights illuminated and reflected back by the water. \\n\\nIts early summer now, when all of southern Brooklyn comes alive and everyone strolls down the pier staring out into the sea. IL Fornetto has all the makings of an Italian seaside restaurant, and the menu reflects that. There is so much fresh seafood here. \\n\\nI just HAD TO order their Linguine Vongole. About maybe 10 minutes later, out came my friendly waiter with a large plate of linguine choked full of savory clams. The pasta was cooked at al dente with the perfect little bite left in it, seasoned and salted well and very garlicy. A+++++ all around!\\n\\nI also ordered their specialty appetizer that they offer exclusively right here called the Mozzarella in Carrozza, which is a fresh mozzarella that's fried in egg batter! Yes, it tastes as good as it sounds!! It was sooo creamy cheesy good and the added fried egg coat made it even better!\\n\\nTo end the night, I ordered two different scoops of their house gelato, one scoop Pistachio and the other scoop Vanilla. \\n\\nDefinitely a beautiful and lovely warm night dining right by the sea.\", u'Great food with a nice view of the bay. Highly recommend to anyone who likes Italian food', u\"My boyfriend and I came for dinner after having a sudden craving for calamari.\\n\\nThe inside is extremely nice! We were blessed with a window table with a view of the waters. It was the best view I had to date at a restaurant in the states!\\n\\nOur server Jose was extremely accommodating and amiable. He made us smile all night! He made sure all our dining needs were fulfilled. The excellent service was the highlight of the night.\\n\\nI checked in on Yelp for free bruschetta (yay). We ordered calamari for starters, rigatoni mezze and linguini vongole. \\n\\nThe bruschetta was light and crisp. I enjoyed it very much :)\\n\\nThe calamari was lightly flavored, crispy, chewy, and when dipped in sauce, was just what we were looking for.\\n\\nThe linguine vongole was good - had to flip my pasta over a few times to get all the saucy goodness. The clams were perfect and clean! I've had a lot of bad experiences with sand in my clams...\\n\\nI tried the rigatoni mezze and I must say it was the best dish of the night. I was a little jealous I didn't order that myself. The vodka sauce was very creamy and decadent - not bitter at all (compared to other places). The shrimp was so tender, juicy, and flavorful. Absolutely delicious. My pasta knowledge is very limited but I'm pretty sure that was not rigatoni noodles (lol) but they were perfectly cooked. Yummmm.\\n\\nWe were too full for dessert :) \\n\\nOverall, great place! A little pricy but well worth it if you're looking for a great Italian dinner in the neighborhood. \\n\\n**Big shout out to Jose for making the dinner that much better.\", u\"Came here for my fianc\\xe9's aunt retirement dinner. I was highly impressed with the service and food. I had mussels for appetizers and shrimp Parmingana for main course. I tasted my fianc\\xe9's clams and it was the best I ever had. They treated our table of about 16 guest with the best service anyone can ask.\", u\"My sister and her new husband held their wedding dinner here and everything was perfect. The food was fantastic and the wait staff was friendly and attentive without being intrusive. The private room is very modern and overlooks the bay (the seagulls and swans swimming under the windows were a big hit with the kids). The manager routinely checked in to make sure that everything was going well. I highly recommend this restaurant, particularly for a private party. You won't be disappointed.\", u\"We celebrated my sisters birthday at this restaurant. It was the first time for everyone one. We went all out. For drinks we had wine, champagne, shots, coffee and tea. \\nFor appetizers we had the Calamari Fritti, Mozzarella in Carrozza and Long Island Oysters. Our Entrees were the Linguine Vongole, Pollo di Fave, Parmigiana, Penne Fornetto and Salmone. For Dessert we had Vanilla Ice Cream, Warm Chocolate Cake and Tiramisu. We were a party of seven and it was all under $400 Portions were perfect. Food was flavorful. Service was top notch. The atmosphere was relaxing and we just felt like a wonderful night out. I wouldn't change one moment. Everything was great especially the Tiramisu which was the Birthday girls favorite dessert along with myself. It just melted in your mouth. We have already planned on coming back for brunch with the wonderful view and date night for my husband and myself.\", u\"I came here for my anniversary and I really enjoyed myself.\\n\\nPrior to coming I was at Coney Island and wash in a go-carting wreck, so my body was in a fair amount of pain. However the beautiful scenery and lovely service was a great distraction from the pain.\\n\\nOf course the first thing that I ordered was Oysters and that is were they lose a star. While the oysters were fresh they were not cleaned well and had lot of gritty partials in them. In addition to the grit for some reason there was lettuce use to garnish the bowl which was wired and it looked soggy. Lastly they served it with a vinegar radish sauce which might literally be the nastiest thing I have ever taste.\\n\\nAs for the food, that was better. I ordered salmon which was good as well as some apple pie pizza.\\n\\nThe apple pie pizza was burnt so that was a bit disappointing but the non-burnt pieces tasted good. \\n\\nAll in All I think it's a solid choice.\", u\"Came here on a Wednesday night, not many people. Had the margarita pizza for appetizer, it's delicious! The food is great, right portions. Also Love the view! Beautiful place\"], u'137.Glady\\u2019s': [u\"So, so delicious. Everything was perfectly done. It was packed when we came in on a Thursday night around 8:30 for dinner, but we were able to get seated almost right away. I got the curry goat and bf got the oxtail stew. We also got bok choy and rice and beans on the side. My curry goat was juicy and tender, not overly salty as it might have seemed. Cleaned my plate like it was my last meal. I also tried bf's oxtail stew and it was delicious as well. The bok choy was well-seasoned and I liked it which says a lot since I don't normally like bok choy that much. Service was quick and friendly, no complaints there. \\n\\nAll in all an excellent meal and I wouldn't think twice to come back here.\", u'Alright, I spent my adult life here in New York, and out of the 5 boroughs I proudly claim my bridges-n-tunnels heritage.  You think Manhattan is great?  It\\'s got its charms, but if you want to do awesome things and enjoy awesome food, you get across the east river and hit BQ.  Queens has the ethnic edge, but Brooklyn\\'s got the hipsters and the core of gentrification.  Take Prospect Heights for instance - 10 years ago this area were mostly working class people from the West Indies, nowadays it\\'s Narino Cold Brew sippers looking up tats on their MacBook Airs in the nearest coworking space, preferably dropping consonants and adding apostrophes.   \\n\\nI used to take the 5 train to Brooklyn College to finish my undergrad, and back then, one of the more reliable ways to get a cheap meal in before heading home is to hit a Jamaican takeout counter for a mini-meal, sometimes on Church Avenue or Eastern Parkway.  Protein (usually jerked chicken), rice and peas, and a scoop of 2 sides.  The familiar patois of \"whadayawant?\", the whacking of jerked meat on a chopping block, the Styrofoam box, and a bottle of Ting to go.  There were full blown West Indies restaurants, but they are often intimidating places with tinted or mirrored windows, full of aggressive men sipping Red Stripes, nary a menu nor bathrooms, cash only, and exemplified by rude wait staff who would greet you with \"hey sidung rite dere bloodclot china bwoi\" who expect you to know what to ask for.  If you are more health conscious, you grab something more healthy (like yard stew or peanut punch) at Imhotep\\'s.  \\n\\nFast forward 10 years.  There\\'s a Starbucks in the corner of Franklin and Eastern Parkway, and there is a steady decline of cheap West Indies dining options in the area.  I mean, it can certainly be decent, but it will cost you.  Take Glady\\'s, for instance.  Why yes, you can get great tasting jerk meats in here - the jerked pork is moist with good penetration of smoke, and the texture reminds me of Cantonese roast pork (char-siu).  The chicken is infused with smoky flavors and the scotch bonnet kick in addition to the usual oregano, allspice and thyme.  You can certainly get good quality rice-and-peas, fried plantains, fruit punch, Sorrel and ginger beer, which are all staples of a good Jamaican cuisine experience.  You can certainly get Ackee and Saltfish for breakfast (the healthier, tastier scrambled-on-protein).  The wait staff is not nearly as rude as the old places it replaced.  The bar choices are definitely more interesting, there is a public restroom, they accept credit cards, and the decor looks nicer in general.   Hell, you can take that art major girl you met on OKCupid here for the third date,  she just moved to the city from Minnesota, and uff da, it\\'s just so cute here, reminds her of this all-inclusive resort she vacationed at Montego Bay with her family back a few years ago.  However, you\\'ll be paying double to triple of what the old Jamaican joints would charge, and you won\\'t have the joy of overcoming your initial reservations at discovering a new cuisine at a rather grimy area.  \\n\\nIt\\'s not like Gladys is bad, it\\'s okay - if I am taking out-of-towners to Brooklyn to have Jamaican for the first time, we\\'ll definitely patronize it, it\\'s really here to impress with its decor and fine presentation.  However, it\\'ll never be my go-to for regular rotation Jamaican food - I know cheaper places with solid quality.  If you moved from Williamsburg to escape all the snobby cafe bros and overpriced Mexican joints, congrats, now you are in a neighborhood with snobby cafe bros and overpriced Jamaican joints.  Sorry folks, that\\'s the way it is with gentrification.  Bloomberg giveth, and Bloomberg taketh away.', u\"I ate here for the first time last night.\\nHad a 1/2 Jerk Chicken, Bok choy and a glass of red wine. \\nThe chicken was flavorful and spicy with the sauce but a bit overcooked and dry.\\nBok choy was soy saucy and okay.\\nThe red wine Alberdi San Giovese was sour and I didn't like it.\\nI think I liked the complimentary coconut ice cream the best.\", u\"In what I can only describe as a trendy Caribbean style diner, Glady's provides amazingly seasoned, well made eats that will leave you full and happy. \\n\\nWe came here for a nice weekday lunch. Service was kind of short that day, so it was hard to order and get seated in the beginning. However, once the initial business died down, we were able to get our food in a timely manner. Staff seemed generally amiable. The decor is vibrant and inviting, with cute menu signs, leafy plants, and thatch work lamps. \\n\\nLet me first say that the food here is delicious. Every single food item was fresh, balanced, and distinct. My personal favorites were the jerk fried wings and the festivals. Each chicken piece had a beautiful char and deeply spiced seasonings to give a nice smoky, flavorful kick. They also gave a spicy mango sauce on the side which only enhanced the flavor profile. We were trying festivals (Caribbean style dumplings) for the first time and were pleasantly surprised by the deliciously fried dough bites. Served warm, they are an absolute treat. \\n\\nOverall, we had a great, eye opening food experience here. Can't wait to come back to the Brooklyn area to try other things on the menu.\", u\"A friend recommended I come here so I decided to stop by for Sunday brunch. I'm only giving 3 stars because as a Caribbean person, I don't feel the food here is super authentic but it's good nonetheless. I got eggs, flatbread (roti), crispy potatoes, and plantains. The crispy potatoes were hard as a rock and my drink wasn't that strong. Those are the only complaints about the meal I had. I'll probably be back in the future but there's probably better out there.\", u\"Sweet baby Cheesus! This place is good. I have been hanging out in Crown Heights a lot lately and the Caribbean influence is strong AF. I'd been itching to try an authentic Carribean place since and Glady's turned out to be a perfect choice. \\n\\nCame here around 8 on Friday after a drink at Superpower (also a good reco) and was immediately salivating after walking in- it smells that good.  We had no issue getting seated right away at a table.The place is small and very cute. It makes you feel like you aren't trapped in hot and sweaty Brooklyn, but rather an island oasis.\\n\\nThe server came over very quickly and was very nice. We ordered the jerk chicken, oxtail, rice and peas, and fried plantains. Everything was so delicious, especially the oxtail and the plantains. I was so into the food, forgot to take pictures!\\n\\nI also love that the place has such a great vibe. The music was dope hip hop and afrobeats and the decor are cute. Everything adds to the island vibes. Go visit!\", u\"I've been coming here since you opened... tonight was the icing on cake. It is 10:20pm as I write this. I walk in and greeted with dirty looks from the 2 women behind the bar dancing. I say table for two and they refuse to sit us. Take out only! They are closed! Google says they close at 11pm. After a hellish delayed fight, my partner and I wanted a quick delicious meal. We ordered our meal to go and will NEVER return. This place has gone down hill. All of the old school staff have been replaced by nasty, lazy people who are more concerned with shaking their tales to the music then proving customer service. I'm tired of this treatment.\\n\\nP.s. Marvia and the big bartender with short hair don't add any value to your business. \\n\\nGood night.\", u'I really feel bad about writing this... just as much as my taste buds truly regrets being subjected to such tasteless Jamaican delicacies... This place should not be in Brooklyn. It would be better suited located somewhere like Ronkokoma, LI. Or you could compare it to terrible resort restaurant. The oxtails... horrendous, festivals... yuck, seitan... Meh, bok choy.. Ok, but I came for the peppered shrimp that was so much better a few months ago. Omg what is happening to Brooklyn, Jesus save us!', u\"This restaurant has been on my radar for some time now.....I kept making excuses and putting off going to Glady's since I was hardly ever near the area. What was I thinking? I really have been missing out on such a unique and special place!\\n\\nWe requested a table for 2 and staff were very accommodating. The hostess ensured that we were seated comfortably. The drink specials included $5 Rum Punch Cocktails and we each had a Passion Fruit Beverage. Good Stuff!\\n\\nGlady's serves some of the best curry flavored food that I have ever tasted. The food items include Curry Lobster, Curry Goat, Curry Chicken etc. There are also various sides to go with your meal (Bok Choy, Rice and Peas, etc.) Since we both wanted to try multiple dishes, we ended up getting Curry Goat and Curry Chicken with Bok Choy, White Rice and Rice and Peas as our sides. Everything and I mean everything was fantastic!!! Each dish with the exception of the White Rice/Rice and Peas was immersed in delicious curry....the Bok Choy and Curry Chicken were my favorite. Glady's even serves a complimentary appetizer of Curry flavored Pineapple slices. It was also pleasurable to eat the complimentary mini cup of ice cream they send you with your bill. \\n\\nGlady's provided such an enjoyable eating experience.\", u'Definitely one of the coolest restaurant\\'s I\\'ve ever been to. If you can imagine a super trendy and upscale Carribean restaunt, Glady;s will be 10 times cooler than what you probably imagined. The food is pretty good too. Not as good as some of the grandma, \"hole in the wall\" places I\\'ve been to around the city, but very good none-the-less. The lamb curry was my favorite. The ox tail left me wanting more meat. The whole fish was fried a little bit too long. The jerk chicken wings rocked! Oh, did I mention they have PAIN KILLERS!!! F**ck yea!! And they are delicious!  \\n\\nTip: On a Friday night the wait was 2 hours. We asked to sit in the window bar and got in right away. Not as comfortable as a table but way better than a two hour wait.', u\"Overall I like Gladys and have been here several times.  This time I tried brunch which ends st 3p.  I arrived at 2:15p. Plenty of seats.  I was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar - no people- I asked to sit at a table. I was told only parties of at least 2 could sit at a table.  Again there were plenty of seats at the table and less than an hour left to brunch.  I sat at the counter - which was empty- and over the 40 minutes I was in the restaurant not one party of 2+ came in but 6 people finished and left.  \\n\\nWould've been great if Gladys evaluated policies based on current situations and with the intention of satisfying the customer.  The restaurant was not crowded, brunch was almost over and I asked to sit at a table.  Truth is- Table chairs are far more comfortable than stools.  Why must a party of one sit uncomfortably on a stool away from everyone else in a partially empty restaurant?    Not good.\\n\\nAlso I ordered a rum punch which is advertised on the website as $4 everyday until 7p.  Drink specials are also called out on Yelp.   I receive my check and the drink is $8.  When I bring this up I am told the website is not up to date.  That is called false advertising.   \\n\\nSo overall I had a disappointing brunch experience.  My server was nice and the breakfast roti I had was ok ( big portion) but I didn't like the way I was treated.\", u\"Terrible food! \\n\\nOrdered take out (jerk chicken, rice/peas and oxtail gravy) and was terribly disappointed with the food, especially given all the hype!\\n\\nThis is another place that's probably getting tons of passerby foot traffic given the location and ultimately lucked out with favorable reviews (most likely from folks who don't know good grub) along the way. \\n\\nYou'd be surprised, the place looks great and well run, unfortunately the food doesn't match. Chicken was bland, dry and nothing like you'd expect for jerk chicken. The rice and peas were equally bad! The oxtail gravy was as close to good as my order got, but still far from the best I've had in BK. If you want real Caribbean food, head over to The Islands on Washington. Don't waste your time or money here cuz it ain't worth it!\", u\"I don't feel the need to ever go back to this place again. I feel like so many restaurants in NYC overcharge for food and drinks. Sure, I get it. It's the price we pay for living in NYC. However, when I'm being charged an irrationally high price for mediocre food, that's when we have a problem. \\n\\nI went back to Glady's to finally try their jerk chicken (since they were out of it the first time I dined here). 1/2 a chicken costs $10 and all of the sides are $4 a pop. I spent about $15 on chicken and a side of rice. I thought that price was a little hefty but took it home anyway. Once I open the container, I come to find that I did not get half a chicken. I got two legs, a little thigh meat, and two back pieces of chicken. I'm a country gal, so I know about my chickens. There's no meat on the backs! I basically gave this restaurant $15 for two legs and a bowl of rice. Highway robbery!\\n\\nConsidering the type of cuisine, it doesn't make sense that it costs that much. On top of that, the quality you're getting here is subpar, to say the least. Try another local Caribbean joint. I'm sure you'll be more pleased with the flavor and price.\", u\"Remember your friend who took that trip to islands once??  He came back and opened a restaurant in the new hipster Brooklyn...but it's not bad at all, I promise.  However, just know that he didn't spend too terribly long on that island before he said, let me open up this restaurant.  Nevertheless, he learned a thing or two about which seasonings to use.  And use them, he did!  Everything is quite reminiscent of your island fare. It's the same foods in general but the preparation is key.  The plantains are tasty in their own way but they aren't of the very sweet and moist variety.  They're more of the dryer variety that I'm used to from some Haitian and West African style cuisines.  My girlfriend and I tried some of the vegetarian options also, splitting the jerk seitan instead of bacon. Seitan normally seasons up well so the jerk spice on it was a welcome addition.  I did the brunch Brioche French toast which was good but a smaller portion than I imagined for the price.  I honestly enjoyed dipping my plantains into the syrup as much as the 3 triangles of French toast.  She had the 2 eggs (meh) with crispy potatoes (good) and flatbread (which I'm so glad they didn't call roti, because my girlfriend is Trini and would've had a heart attack lol)\\n\\nThis place is rather cozy and intimate in a smaller communal setting. It's well-decorated but not overly chaotic. I say sure stop-in and get an idea of the islands from a more American perspective.\", u\"Why is Brooklyn the place to go to get good Caribbean food? I mean Islands, Sugarcane and now Glady's! I'm getting ready to pack up and move down there... \\n\\nAnyway, the home of Caribbean food has another great spot to chow down on Caribbean grub - Glady's. Simplicity is one of the key notes of Glady's whether it is the decor or the focused menu.\\n\\nThe decor is 1950s meets greenery meets modern twist. I love the metal green chairs with the potted plant ceiling lamps and the simplistic wooden family style tables. The space is tiny so get ready to wait if you're coming for dinner on a weekend.\\n\\nThe focused menu is great with authentic Caribbean options as well as fun fusion options. And the best is that the menu is not extensive which makes it easy to make a decision (shout out to Paradox of Choice).\\n\\nI got the Curry Goat but was extremely tempted with their Jerk Seitan and Peppered Shrimp options.\", u\"Wonderful little spot. Food and drinks are great. It's a bit small but very cute. The ambiance makes you feel like you are in a  restaurant near the beaches of montego bay. The house hot sauce has a tangy spice kick. Very nice place and parking isn't to hard too find.\", u\"It is a crime to live in Brooklyn and not try Gladys.\\n\\nI've lived in Crown Heights for FOUR whole years, walking distance from Gladys for a whole month.  I honestly thought they were a bar because of the vibe, that lighting.  I don't know what I was smoking back then.  But earlier this week I was leaving Brooklyn Museum looking for a spot nearby.  Low and behold, two seats were available at Gladys no wait.\\n\\nThe ambience, the delectable jerk chicken.  Oh the spices!!  \\n\\nAND Gladys is available on Caviar.  So if you don't have the time to stop in for all the goodness that is the at-restaurant experience, just order.  Like I did not but two days later.\", u'Not sure how this establishment has such a high rating. 7/15/17 my niece and I stopped in for a late dinner. After a slow service, we ordered our meal. 1/2 jerk ckn; plantains; festivals; peas and rice and green salad, and my niece ordered a Mai Tai. The plantains we were served were burned very badly. The \"green\" salad had peanuts in them, and although neither of us has a peanut allergy; they should clearly disclose that on the menu. The food overall was not well seasoned.  And the Mai Tai is served with a huge sprig of mint. Perhaps that\\'s their thing. But it threw the taste off. I couldn\\'t honestly recommend this place. I am from the Caribbean, so I know exactly how this food should taste. And it fell way below \\'authentic\\' Caribbean food. \\n\\nI told one of the servers that the plantains were burned and he just laughed as he removed them from the table. He didn\\'t remove them from the bill though!  We paid for everything; but did not snap a pick at the table.  We packed it up to take a picture later. Can you tell the meat from the vegetable? And the total? $51 bucks! \\n\\nNot sure if the name sake is still around, but if my name were on the bldg., I would watch quality control and customer service.', u\"I ordered rice and peas with plantains, festivals, and bok choy. The peas were undercooked and the rice was inconsistent throughout. The festivals were undercooked inside, but tasted as if the oil used to make them was old. They were dark on the outside and mushy on the inside. The plantains weren't even bearable. It was as if they were over ripe and deep fried to a crisp. I couldn't even eat them. The bok choy was the only thing that was good. As a Caribbean restaurant, I am HIGHLY disappointed. It is a shame that the one portion they got right was a vegetable not native to the Caribbean, come on.\", u\"Glady's was my first experience for Caribbean food. I came here my family and with some friends. We loved everything we had the entire dinner.\\n\\nThe food was amazing and they were all interesting. We ordered the:\\n-Curry goat: It was good and tender.\\n-Jerk Chicken: Spicy and Moist. My favorite.\\n-Rice and peas: light and coconut scented\\n-Jerk Pork: It was great.\\n-Jerk lobster: It was fresh and delicious.\\n-Green salad: also fresh and healthy.\\n\\nThis is now my new go to spot for a great bite. The whole vibe was great!\"], u'191.Fonda': [u'One of my favorite neighborhood go-to\\'s! I\\'ve tried a TON of menu items so here goes trying to capture them all... \\n\\n1.) The guacamole. It\\'s so freaking good. And it\\'s served with soft tortillas and chips AND a delicious smoky salsa on the side. It\\'s a bit pricey, but worth it. Also gives you a reason to try their happy hours where you can get it for practically half off. \\n\\n2.) Carne asada con hongos (Steak with mushrooms). My favorite entree! The sauce they use has a little kick to it -- and pulls the whole dish together beautifully. It\\'s a great sized portion too. \\n\\n3.) Salmon en pepita. Lighter alternative to the steak entree, probably my 2nd favorite entree. The pineapple salsa is lovely!!\\n\\n4.) The margaritas. All of them, but ESPECIALLY the Pepino. I normally only order one drink when I go out but it\\'s almost impossible to do that here because it\\'s so delicious and refreshing thanks to the cucumber ginger \"infusion\" and the pasilla rim (think a little sweet, a little spicy). \\n\\nI\\'ve also had so many great specials which you can never really go wrong with. Also worth trying are any of the taquitos, the carnitas, the shrimp and scallops. And if you\\'re a vegetarian, please try the roasted stuff poblano pepper!! \\n\\nAlso worth noting I\\'ve ordered delivery maybe twice from here and it\\'s been a great experience. Normally though, we like to go to the restaurant, especially when the weather is nice and you can take advantage of the outdoor space.', u\"2 stars due to the following:\\n-Food is way too salty specifically the guacamole to the point that we had to return it (and don't get me wrong, I like salt but this was extreme!! I mean it's hard to mess a guacamole right? Especially at a Mexican restaurant.. \\n2- service was very slow with only 1 server for the whole restaurant on a packed weekend night. No concern for follow up on meals, checking if everything ok..\\n3- margaritas were alright \\n4-prices are too high for the food especially with such mediocre quality and poor service.\\n\\nThe only thing I liked was the ceviche\", u'A Mexican restaurant that ran out of avacodos....\\nPretty much says it all. Dinner specials.. surprise! Also out.\\nIs it so much to ask for a stocked menu on a weekend??!\\nService was average. \\nAs you can see, there was plenty of water.', u\"It's been a while since I've been back to Fonda and what can I say? Too many places to eat, too little time.\\n\\nI came here for dinner for a family date, thinking it would be nice to sit outside. The place was pretty accommodating, allowing us to bring along a stroller for my friends infant. A plus. Then things started to go downhill.\\n\\nThe service was slow...to the point where we had to wave to other waiters to get our waiters attention. The food? Sub-par at best.\\n\\nWe ordered a carafe of red sangria to share. It was pretty water down and not worth the $32. Should have stuck with beer like my husband or wine. We ordered the gauc (double) as appetizer and i was surprised by how small the portion was. We had a table of 4 adults and 2 kids which was why we ordered the double. I wouldn't mind so much if it was amazing guacamole as what I use to remember but that wasn't the case. It was full of fillers, tomatoes and onions in every bite instead of avocado! And it was a tad heavy on the salt. Definitely not the creamy goodness of years past.\\nFor our main, we ordered the steak tacos, adobo pork, the cod special (filet pan seared with avo & tomatoes and the shrimp with rice for me and my daughter to share. The steak tacos were ok (A bit on the dry side.) the pork adobo was pretty good, very flavorful they gave us so little tortilla to eat it with we had to ask for more 3x. The cod was dry as hell. Normally when fish is described as fillet, it means frozen so I don't have much expectations. As for the shrimp, The waiter either misunderstood or miscommunicated my dish. I specifically asked whether or not the shrimp was spicy and the waiter said the sauce and the rice was but the shrimp was not. I asked if we can swap the rice for something else because it's for my 4yr old daughter and clearly can't eat spicy food, he just said no. I was surprised he didn't even bother to check with the chef/kitchen or maybe the manager? Anyway the dish came out and even with the sauce on the side, the shrimp itself was spicy. Taste wise, it was ok. Nothing special. She ended up eating a side of rice that came with the pork dish.\\n\\nOverall this was not the experience I seem to remember nor the price. The bill came out to be $220.\", u\"Absolutely amazing Mexican food! We only regret not trying this place sooner! \\n\\nFor the two of us, we ordered three appetizers and one entree to share and the potion was just right! Here's the breakdown\\n\\nGazpacho Blanco is very refreshing and light with texture of almonds and grapes halves. Very nice summer special to cool the pallets for what comes next. \\n\\nThe Zarape de Pato was very flavorful, thanks to the drenching tomato-habanero  sauce which is so rich and creamy, with a great kick! \\n\\nThe Flautas De Pollo was also crispy and yummy but I have to give it up for the other two apps! Fianc\\xe9 enjoyed this one the most tho! \\n\\nWe usually opt for guacamole at a Mexican establishment (duh) but we decided to skip this time because we just made our own the other night. It prob would be our reason to be back because everyone around us ordered the guac and it just looked so fresh and yummy! \\n\\nWe had the Carnitas de Fonda as entree which was amazing and very fun to eat/share among two! You can build your own tacos with the pickle onion and peppers, salsa verde, rice and beans which come with the deal and the potion is quite generous and perfect for sharing! \\n\\nWill def be back for the brunch (bottomless!) and so glad they do have locations in Manhattan as well!\", u\"Fonda is your average Mexican restaurant with an upscale flare. The restaurant itself is very small and intimate, with a nice outdoor patio. The wait for two on a Friday night was about 20 minutes, but you can wait at the bar if there is seating available.\\n\\nI ordered the crab cakes and the esquites. The crab cakes could have had more flavor, but the sauce was excellent! The esquites was okay, I've had better.\\n\\nOverall, Fonda is a cool spot to if you're in the mood for Mexican. A little pricey, so maybe go if you're feeling to splurge a little.\", u'Could not love their food (particularly their brunch) or their staff any more. Everything is EXCELLENT. A little on the pricy side, but worth every penny.', u'Has an outdoor seating area, good service. Love the fish tacos and steak was very well prepared.', u'Great food. The drinks were mediocre however the food made up for it. Sweet plantains were very tasty and the skirt steak was very tasty. Will totally come back', u\"Really expensive Mexican food but their frozen margaritas are so good, I'm willing to overlook paying $20 for 2 tiny tacos and $13 for the delicious guacamole.\", u'tacos are perfect and cocktails are just delightful!  Our family loves it!', u\"Came here for brunch with my 2 friends who were visiting from out of town. I wanted to show them a fun NY boozy brunch experience. Our reservation was at 11:15 and were weren't served water or drinks till after 11:30. \\n\\nNo complaints on the actual food or drinks, but the service was subpar. We finished 1 drink and ordered 1 more with hour meal. We wanted another before leaving which we were denied. It was noon at this point and we were told our hour ended. They waiter was kind, but wasn't willing to work with us. We were extremely disappointed with this service and will no longer be back. I have had positive experience at the manhattan location, but I'd stay away from this one if you want a fun boozy brunch.\", u'My first time to dine-in and I sat at bar for get a happy hours. That is very good food here. I love their guacamole the most. Good services too.', u\"I have been here three times now and I'm finding it is one of my favorite local Mexican restaurants. The only downside is the lack of vegetarian options. But for a Pescatarian there are a lot of options and I have found all of the seafood to be of a really high-quality. \\n\\nAlso on a Sunday from 4 to 6 they have happy hour at the bar and you can get really well discounted guacamole and some other bar snacks. \\n\\nI have never had too much of a problem getting a table but I try to go at off times. \\n\\nThe crab cakes are delicious, they are small and there are three of them but they all have a different sauce on them. I have also had the fish tacos and really enjoyed those. The last time I went I had the special pork pozole soup and it was really hearty and satisfying. \\n\\nEven though the guacamole can be expensive and less it is happy hour it is a very large portion and delicious and fresh. I also tried the bread putting I would recommend that. \\n\\nThey have not let me down so I'm going to keep coming here more often! \\n\\nI especially love the backyard area and It can also be a good first date place. \\n\\nVery laid-back and friendly service. When we sat at the bar I also found the bartender was quite engaging without being disruptive.\", u\"I came here for a birthday celebration with a group of girls and for the most part my experience here was pretty good. Service was quick and efficient. They have unlimited drinks for an hour for a flat rate. Don't abuse the boozy bring unless you have high tolerance! Ambiance is pretty relaxed. I saw a couple of family enjoying brunch here as well. Overall, not a bad experience.\", u\"I came here 3 years ago and was blown away by the service/ food at dinner. Perhaps my mistake is in coming back during brunch. \\n\\nWe had a reservation for 6 people which had to be pushed back due to some members of our party being late. The manager and/ or bartender got very pushy about needing the table. We absolutely understood and, after the third time he interrupted our conversation in 10 minutes like a nagging dad, we offered to sit and order for the late folks to expedite the process. \\n\\nOur party showed up 5 minutes after this interaction (making their lateness about 15 minutes total). The food came out pretty quickly, but all members of the party were fairly disappointed with the size and flavor of the brunch offerings (the exception being the burrito, which was bomb).\\n\\nTwo final thoughts: the waiter did not refill our drinks nearly enough for an all you can drink deal and didn't even ask us for a final round before the time was up. Leaving the restaurant after an hour, there were a number of still empty tables which was deeply confusing given the manager's anxious attitude toward our tardy friends.\\n\\nI likely won't return without a good reason- there are a number of other brunch spots with better service. Maybe dinner is superior?\\n\\nThe kicke\", u'Finally a real Mexican restaurant in NY!  Great food, server was nice & knowledgable.  All in all I am a happy California camper.', u\"Great food and good quality! Fonda is making some delicious Mexican food. Prices here are a bit steep but the taste and quality of the food justifies the cost. \\n\\nThe restaurant has cozy brick walls and dim light ambiance that gives the restaurant a warm feeling. There is also outdoor seating which we chose. Ideal on a warm summer night. The wait staff is very and helpful with the menu. We came on a Saturday evening and the wait wasn't too bad. \\n\\nAs for the food everything was delicious. We orders the made to order guacamole that was served in a stone mortar. The guac tastes super fresh and all the ingredients were on point. \\n\\nFor the main course we ordered the skirt steak and grilled shrimp. The steak was juicy tender and melt in your mouth. Perfect seasoning and the portion was good for two. The shrimp was cooked to perfection and it was served over a bed of grains and beans. Delicious! \\n\\nFonda is a great place to check out if you are in the neighborhood . Really great authentic Mexican food !\", u'We came here on a Sunday afternoon for an early dinner. Apparently it is a very popular spot in the neighborhood and you must have a reservation most of time. The luck was on our side that day because we got seated outside right away. \\n\\nThe bar area was packed and buzzing! The music was rather loud but the overall atmosphere felt cozy. We were seated in the backyard which was simple and cute. There were quite a few mean mosquitos and flies around but we survived :)\\n\\nDrinks: a great selection of mezcals, awesome Palomas and yummy watermelon margaritas! \\n\\nAppetizers: the ones that we got were fantastic - the chunky spicy guac and hot cheesy Queso Fundido with mushrooms!\\n\\nEntrees: enchiladas suizas - cheesy, spicy and tasty, pollo norteno (the only organic meat on the menu) as well as carnitas de Fonda - great portion, delicious and good for sharing because u can make tacos out of them. \\n\\nThe service was on point too, fast, friendly, suggestive, confident.', u\"They wouldn't let me sit at a table happy hr  with my foot in a cast on crutches even though i had reservation for dinner   I sat at the bar had a few margaritas.  When i got off stool to leave i fell on my face.  I was really embarrassed.  The upside being the drinks were strong.\\n\\nI read another similar review.  Wtf happened to humanity?\"], u'12.Soco': [u\"MAN O MAN!\\n\\nThis place was everything we expected and more! The food was aaaaaaaaaaaaaaamzing!!!! \\n\\nThe short ribs had the perfect balance of sweet and spice and were cooked perfectly with a little char on them and they were crispy! The wings, similarly seasoned and cooked were amazing! \\n\\nThe cornbread w/ the butter was fantastic and a must have side. Its balanced out the whole meal for us but for people that dont like sweet, I wouldn't recommend it. WE LOVE IT THOUGH!\\n\\nThe fried chicken and red velvet ( I am not a fan of red velvet in general) was very essentially seasoned and cooked. I honestly do like a little bit more flavor on my fried chicken but his was traditionally done and it was solid solid solid! \\n\\nThe best dish was the grits with the prawns and the sauce on that was finger licking good!!!! \\n\\n4 stars because the drinks were not up to par!! I got an Old fashion and it came with some orange juice in there, which really threw me off! I switched over to whiskey and soda and that worked a lot better! \\n\\nOverall, the food here is impeccable! Loved it!\", u\"My previous attempts to try this highly rated restaurant resulted in 1 + hour wait times, so I decided to try brunch this time.  The front window was opened up to let the sun shine in. Beautiful and clean. Sat at the bar and the attentive bartender immediately handed me a drink and food menu.\\n\\nThe special is $15 unlimited mimosas for an hr. Ordered primitivo and she thoughtfully let me test it before pouring. Big plus. I'm used to this at restaurants. Ordered the short rib hash which consisted of slow cooked short ribs in a sweet brown sauce and cubed potatoes with two eggs on top. Short ribs didn't taste super fresh, and the sweet sauce made the dish awkward.\\n\\nThe service and hospitality are wonderful as is the decor and aesthetics of the place. Will try other items to see if they are better.\", u'My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary and it was perfect! My boyfriend had the chicken and red velvet waffles and I had the ribs with mac and cheese which was AMAZING!\\n\\nOur waiter was extremely accommodating and answered all of my million questions. The drinks were different but in a good way. I am definitely looking forward to going back again soon.', u'I LOVE YOU SOCO!\\n\\nWe went hungry -- we left buzzed and stuffed with food to take home. A night to put in the books for sure.\\n\\nWe ordered lots of food here, but I stilled wish we could have tried everything off their menu!! Everything was so flavorful, no items were the same as the other. There were two large groups dining while we were there. The staff was fun, and very nice. The music was sooooo good! \\n\\nIf I could go back in time and recreate how awesome this experience was.. I would in a heartbeat!', u'One of my close friends wanted to celebrate her birthday here, so another Sunday Brunch celebration. I honestly did not want to come back from my last encounter but I digress.\\n\\nI am glad I came back. The wait staff is so much better than last time. The red velvet pancakes and fried chicken is still a fan favorite. I missed how delicious it was. \\n\\nFyi: make sure to call for reservations', u'For my birthday earlier last week, my friend and I went to Soco for some much needed soul food. With more than 1,500 reviews and 1,700 photos and still able to maintain a solid 4 star rating on Yelp, I admit, I went in with high expectations! We arrived for dinner at 6pm and they had just finished setting up. Outside, restaurant doesn\\'t seem like much, but once inside, the dining area is quite expansive. Nice looking bar at the front of house and large dining area with spaced out tables, as well as, an outdoor seating area out back. Seats were comfortable and tables were well proportioned. \\n\\nHaving looked through the menu beforehand, we already had a good idea of what we were gonna order! We skipped the apps and started off with some sides: an order of their mac n cheese and cornbread and white cheddar grits. For entrees, I had the whole branzino and my friend had the jambalaya. The apps came out in good time; I think we only waited like 15 minutes or so. \\n\\nSides: First off, let me start off with the mac n cheese. I LOVE mac n cheese. Whenever I go to a restaurant that has it, I almost always have to order it! Loll That being said, their mac n cheese delicious! Or as Queens CM Jando puts it quite well \"DANGEROUS.\" Nice crispy layer on top and gooey cheese throughout. And the grits and cornbread.. You MUST eat them together! Perfect marriage of flavors! Warm, buttery cornbread and the creaminess of the white cheddar grits! Delish! :D \\n\\n**Keep in mind though, the white cheddar grits, cornbread and the mac n cheese are rather heavy and very filling. Even for a guy like me, with an appetite like Snorlax, I was already feeling sleepy by the time we finished the apps.**\\n\\nEntrees came out and my friend and I were already feeling the early onset of food coma. So we literally nibbled at our food and took most of it to go. The few bites I had of my food and of my friend\\'s jambalaya, tasted pretty good. The branzino was definitely well prepared. Flesh was flaky and not dry and the rice stuffing was flavorful. My friend\\'s jambalaya was tasty as well. Loved the andouille chicken and the shrimp! \\n\\nOverall, we had a delicious meal and great experience dining at Soco. Service was very accommodating! Halfway through our meal, I brought to the attention of one of our waitresses that it was quite hot in the dining area and she said their central a/c was down for repairs. She recommended we be re-seated near the door, as there was a nice breeze coming through the front door, and so we did just that. I will definitely be back to try some other dishes from the menu! :D', u\"Ok. Let me set the scene. Saturday Brunch time and we don't have a reservation. We walk, the restaurant was full BUT there are alot of empty tables. We are told it's going to be a 20 minute wait. This is all strange because the front and back of the restaurant are literally empty. Anyways no biggie, we go to the bar and maybe 10 minutes later we are seated. \\n\\nOrdered the fish and chips and Buttermilk fried chicken (one of the signature dishes). Overall the food was okay. \\n\\nFish and chips - fries that came with it was rather bland and the fish was just okay. \\n\\nButtermilk fried chicken - the waffle was very flour tasting. Seemed like one of those out the box pancake mixes. The chicken was ok. Nothing really special.\\n\\nThis place has been a little over hyped...I'm just saying.\", u\"Soco is a pretty solid brunch spot in Brooklyn. The prices are pretty comparable to a brunch experience in Manhattan (and even my favorites in Harlem), but the ambiance is what really makes the experience. There is indoor and outdoor seating, good music playing, and doesn't get too packed on Sundays. Saturdays are different, but I didn't have an obnoxiously long wait (maybe 25 minutes). The outdoor area makes for excellent pictures/selfies. And If you check in on yelp, you get free cornbread! \\n\\nI've had the sweet potato pancakes, the wing appetizer, red velvet chicken and waffle, and the short rib hash. If I had to rank them in order of awesome-ness;\\n\\n-Chicken and waffle\\n-Sweet Potato Pancakes\\n-Wings\\n-Short Rib Hash\\n\\nAnd I realize that deciding what you are in the mood for (either sweet or savory or both), can really make or break your brunch experience. so if you are in the mood for savory, anything with the chicken is a win. The chicken on the side of the waffle was seasoned RIGHT! The waffle was a bit thick, but I liked how they paired. The sweet potato pancakes sort of taste like regular pancakes but the way the present it with powdered sugar, berries and syrup make for a solid choice. The wings were good (nothing really stuck out about them). The reason that the short rib hash was at the bottom of my list is because there was something about it or the sauce that was a little sweet and it made the dish entirely too rich. I was stuffed, and I can usually eat a lot. \\n\\nI would still definitely recommend Soco. I want to try the Shrimp and Grits entr\\xe9e soon!\", u\"Soco is a pretty big space. If you've never been in the area but heard of it before, it's probably because of the fried chicken and red velvet waffle dish they have.\\n\\nIt ain't haute cuisine, but most things on the menu pricier than you'd think for comfort food. Chicken and waffle was $20. The smoked BBQ chicken was the same price, and they had a few entrees that went up to close to $30.\\n\\nWe started out with the Asian style ribs. Would've preferred not Asian style (too sweet), but they were tender and meaty.\\n\\nWe wanted to get the mac and cheese, but it was basically a cast iron skillet of fat and cholesterol. You could probably split it among 4-5 people.\\n\\nThe chicken and waffle was good, though the red velvet was pretty gimmicky. Not sure I would put it on any best-of fried chicken lists, other than the Instagrammable quality of it.\\n\\nThe smoked chicken is the way to go. You get basically a half chicken. Cooked perfectly with a ton of BBQ sauce, mashed potatoes and string beans. Though you could probably also split that with one other person and be full.\\n\\nI'm fat, is what I'm saying.\\n\\nAnyway, they have a backyard too, which is cool. Speaking of cool, their air conditioning didn't kick in until about 15 minutes into the meal, so it was a bit uncomfortable. Only other complaint was they let this giant group younger kids wait for a table (or just hang out) by the bathroom area, which caused a ton of congestion. It was weird.\\n\\nBut overall, not a bad experience by any stretch.\", u\"Went here Labor Day weekend with my cousins. Food was amazing but cousins experienced some issues with the waiter over not being forthwith about drink specials ab I I also almost got charged for a free cornbread but had to regulate that situation.\\nOther than that it's a hip place with good food.\", u\"3 years later and my pork chop was nicely seasoned. I also loved the collard greens and mashed sweet potato. Oh and the Brooklyn Bellini was everything!  Enjoyed my girls night here. Won't take so long to return\", u\"Went to Soco for brunch with friends yesterday. We were super late for our reservation, but we didn't wait too long for another table. No complaints on the service, even the busboy was friendly, helpful and joked with us. We shared mac and cheese as an appetizer and it was THEE BEST. I had sausage and grits, which came with 2 over easy eggs and lobster sauce. It was good, but probably wouldn't order it again. I also drank a red lemonade ((alcoholic drink), I enjoyed it. Cool spot with outdoor seating it's the back, wasn't too crowded. I would return.\", u\"After hearing the raves about this place, I met up with friends for a catch up brunch.  This place gets packed on Sundays so just keep that in mind. We ended up waiting for about 35 mins for a party of 4 which I'm told is fairly normal.  We were able to snag a great table in the back in a garden area which had a huge skylight so you felt like you were sitting outside. \\n\\nService was a bit spotty as things we ordered didn't come or we had to remind the waitstaff numerous times for drinks or sides.  The mac n cheese was sitting out for 10 mins before my main came out. They do automatically add gratuity of 18% to parties of 3 or 4 and 20% to parties greater than 4. \\n\\nNow the food: we got a feast as the menu was really appetizing. They have a lot of great choices so I had some menu anxiety. I ended up picking the omelette special as it was full of goat cheese, spinach, veggies and spices ($13) which also came with potatoes and toast.  It was a good omelette but the potatoes were the best thing on the plate: delicious with great seasoning, char, and flavor. I also split sides of mac n cheese ($11) and corn bread ($5) that were delicious. The mac n cheese was really good with a well baked crispy top with creamy insides. My friends got the chicken and waffles ($20). Probably the best thing on the menu!\", u\"I came here about 3 years ago for a business lunch it was fairly new than.\\n So fast forward to now; I decided to check them out for brunch. I made a reservation for 2 on a Sunday @ 4pm, we arrived a little early but that wasn't a problem, we got seated rightf away.  We ordered a carafe of Mardi Gras cocktail which was a $35 special. It was good for the first drink after that i was overbearing, the sweetness and cinnamon or nutmeg.\\n\\nI had the steak and eggs, and a side of cheddar grits. My date had french toast with a side of eggs and turkey bacon. The waitress got our order wrong, I guess because she didn't write it down and thought she'd remember. Instead of french toast my girl received chi ken and waffles, so we had to wait 10mins to change the order, in the mean time my food got cold waiting for hers to come out. The waitress was apologetic about it and at the end of it all gave her a free drink. Overall it was okay. I guess i have to come back cor dinner!? Oh at a certain time someone comes and plays live music, which was wonderful to my ears!!\", u'My friends and I came here on a Thursday night. The ambiance is nice and casual, and there was live music when we were here. The menu items looked great and was torn on what to order because everything looked so great. \\n\\nI looked to the other tables to see what other people ordered, and I decided on the \"Organic Buttermilk Fried Chicken with Red Velvet Waffle.\" I\\'ll say that the dish looked much better than it tasted. I ordered it because I thought a red velvet waffle was really unique and I never tried it before. But, the star of the dish was the fried chicken. The dish came with only syrup, but no gravy.\\n\\nI\\'ve had chicken and waffles at other places including Maharlika in the East Village that serves fried chicken with ube waffle and Roscoe\\'s Chicken and Waffles in Los Angeles. The chicken and waffles here were nothing compared to the ones served at those other 2 places. \\n\\nThe service was mediocre. When you walk in, there is a nice gentleman who opens/closes the door for you and takes you to your table. But, then our server (Tori) wasn\\'t very attentive or knowledgeable. Since it was our first time here, we asked for recommendations and she didn\\'t have any specific cocktails or dishes to recommend citing everything on the menu was just good. There were also long periods of time where she could not be found and the drinks came at the same time as our entrees. \\n\\nAlso, one of my biggest pet peeves is when the gratuity is automatically added to the bill and then there is also a separate tip line. This place automatically added 18% gratuity onto our bill. For those who do that, they don\\'t deserve extra tip. \\n\\nLastly, the area around the restaurant can be rough, especially for someone who is walking down Myrtle from Downtown Brooklyn late at night. If you\\'re coming to this area, either take a cab, Uber, or subway. Or else, you\\'ll meet a lot of sketchy people along the way.\\n\\nOverall, if it weren\\'t for the waitress, I would\\'ve wanted to come back. But most likely, I would choose to go somewhere else for southern food.', u\"We came here one evening to see what the hype was about. We didn't make reservations but the wait wasn't too bad, about 20 mins. The receptionist I felt was a bit rude when we came to ask for a table. \\n\\nNonetheless, we sat down and quickly ordered our food to avoid the rush. We ordered the mac and cheese, lobster/shrimp and grits and the chicken and waffles. The mac and cheese was the highlight of the night, i did not expect such a creamy and cheesy mac. Probably one the best mac and cheeses I have had in a soul food / Cajun joint in a long time. My chicken and waffles was good but nothing beyond extraordinary. The grits were cooked well and the seafood tasted fresh. After the whole meal, the only memorable dish was the mac and cheese. \\n\\nOverall, I think because we weren't greeted well, the bad taste lingered and the food didn't taste as great as we hoped.\", u\"Service was trash. We came in at 10:45 pm for food and they told us the kitchen closes at 11. Okay our fault I guess, so we decided to stay in and get some drinks. Service was still whack af. The waitress took mad long getting out drinks and the place wasn't even busy. The waitress and hostess were basically beefin in front of us and saying she ain't even wanna be there. Basically, if you got time to argue with each other like u got time to serve us something. Only good thing bout SOCO was my sugarcane drink  big favorite. I would send people to soco for the sugarcane drink.\", u\"First things first - their Instagram makes their food looks way better than it tastes.  \\n\\nMy BF and I came here for dinner on Friday night. We were 'greeted' by front of house who avoided making eye contact. That was strange. We then waited about 10 mins to be seated (despite having a reservation).\\n\\nOn to the food: \\nFor starters we had the wings and the ribs. Whilst the flavours were nice the meat was so tough. Didn't fall off the bone as you'd expect from both these bit of food.\\n\\nMain: I had the jambalaya. It was topped with spoke jumbo shrimp which looked great but were also over cooked. This also bothers me because in my opinion shrimp is not hard to get right. Flavour wise... I for sure could have made a better version myself. \\n\\nThe Mac and Cheese is what gets the stars here. It was really good. And the portion was huge considering it was a side dish. I could have happily had this for my meal instead. \\n\\nWe also got a side of corn bread for checking in on Yelp. Nice touch I guess.\\n\\nWe didn't finish it all so naturally asked to have the food boxed up to go. And so we were brought three different containers over and left to our own devices. I just don't get this... why not just take it out back and box it up like every other establishment that I've been too? The fact that I paid $100 for, quite frankly rubbish food the least you can do is box it up for me...\\n\\nDisappointed to say the least...\", u\"Talk about authentic southern food!! The grits & jambalaya beat Jacob Pickles & Sugar Freak! I love my food! The atmosphere's casual with live music! Such talent! Kudos to our waitress Crystal and the dude with the electric violin!\", u\"It's rare that Eat Club rates any place 5 starts, but we LOVE this one. We came for the Jambalaya... it was equal to anything in New Orleans... but EVERYTHING was good. We had the steak and pork chops as well... plus mussels and ribs... WOW!\\n\\nIt looked bad at first. They couldn't find our reservation... then EVERYTHING fell into place. Besides helpful and friendly staff... including the Bartender who served us before the place officially opened... and the manager who came over several times... the other customers were also super friendly. Instant friends with the next table. If you don't leave this place with a smile... you've got some serious medical problem. See a doctor quick!\\n\\nI've lived in NYC since 1976. Before I came here, I'd never been to this part of Brooklyn before. (It's being taken over by Pratt University.) But I'll sure be back!\"], u'182.Champs Diner': [u\"I've been stalking this place for months now as I've been slowly scoping out vegan spots as a new flexetarian. (Don't judge me.) Everything here always looked amazing and I knew I wanted to visit but it is sooooo out of the way. In any event, I finally got the chance to go today and boy was it everything.\\n\\nFirst off, the parking was not bad given that it was a Sunday. It's also close to the L line so that's an option. The wait, however, wasn't the best. We waited almost an hour to be seated so we took a walk around until we got the text that our table was ready. Luckily it was a nice day otherwise we would have been in the car or something.\\n\\nOnce inside I realized why the wait was so long. It truly is a small spot. Maybe 15 tables at most and you definitely shouldn't bring a big group here.\\n\\nThe food more than made up for it though and it came out quickly. The only thing is that we do try to avoid soy and this place was heavy on the soy dishes as the tofu scramble or some other soy-based product was the foundation of every dish. All in all, we enjoyed every dish we got. From the French toast to the burrito and the soltero bowl, everything was flavorful and just all around yummy. The portions were also huge and very filling.\\n\\nIf we can get there as soon as they open for brunch or closer to closing then we will probably be back.\", u\"Awesome all-vegan diner! They have so many options for literally anything you might be in the mood for! \\n\\nThey always have a wait - no matter what time of day. So plan accordingly and get there earlier than when you want to eat. You give your name to the hostess and they text you when your table is ready. We waited over an hour for our table for 2 on a Sunday around 1pm. \\n\\nThis is a really small restaurant and it gets pretty cramped. There's really limited seating which adds to the wait time, and you're dining really close to the other tables - like almost touching elbows close. \\n\\nThe food was delicious. I ordered the Benedict, and my boyfriend ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich. We also got an order of the tater tots with cheese and bacon. \\n\\nThe Benedict was exactly what I was looking for in terms of a filling breakfast dish. The tofu egg was so similar in texture to an actual egg, and their ham substitute was also spot on. The hollandaise sauce is very rich in mustard, but very good! The muffin needed to go through the toaster one more time, but other than that no complaints.\\n\\nThe cheese sauce that you can get on the crispy hot tater tots was to die for. So good!!!\", u'Came here on a double date with another married couple who suggested this place as it was all vegan. \\n\\nWe were a little skeptical(okay, I was...) but totally open to it. \\n\\nOutside is interesting. Its like a restaurant in the middle of a neighborhood. You definitely cant miss it though. \\n\\nWe shared the Tatertachos for appetizers \\nMy wife had the spicy grilled chicken burger and I had the buffalo chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries\\nWe also ordered a classic shake with cookie crumbles and my wife had the chocolate chip cookie dough. \\n\\nEverything. \\n\\nEverything tasted so flavorful!!! \\n\\nMost of the items are all vegan made and man were they agreeing with our taste buds. Those tatertachos were on point! The shakes were extremely tasty, I could hear the crunch of my cookie crumbles \\n\\nReally liked how big the portions was. Could not finish my meal and I can definitely put away some food when hungry. \\n\\nAll in all, service was great, food was amazing. We will return.', u'Delicious spot serving up dishes that you\\'d never expect are meat-free. Not the healthiest grub, but still great.\\n\\nCome here for the times you\\'re hungover and the thought of putting vegan food in your system is somehow you doing your body a favor after all of the damage done the night before. You\\'ll thank yourself.\\n\\nMy friend and I were starving, and the wait was pretty minimal for a weekend lunch. They utilize an app to help track the wait time, as well.\\n\\nWe shared a giant plate of their loaded tater tot-chos ($12), which were fantastic (but I could have done without the black beans).\\n\\nI\\'ve had the Pancake Slam ($13) twice here so far, and I must say the flavors are definitely an acquired taste. The tofu scramble has some turmeric mixed in to add to the egg-like flavor, but if you go in with the understanding that \\n\\n1. nothing is going to taste exactly as it would without meat byproducts \\n2. the pancakes will be super dense, but still delicious\\n3. the \"meats\" are not actual meat\\n\\nthen you shall be fine. I did not, however, enjoy the cheesecake. That stuff was not very ideal.\\n\\nDon\\'t forget the postcard that comes with your check. And check out the little tchotchkes hanging all over the walls.', u\"I usually steer away from any type of fake meat that's served on a menu, but Champs Diner received a gold star in my book. \\n\\nI was so impressed by how many meals can be made using alternative meats. Mind blowing. They had a very extensive menu, from all day breakfast, sandwiches, grain bowls, and yes of course, burgers. I ended up ordering the Parm Sandwhich. Now, I was about to rate this place lower, since the Parm Sandwhich was not a good choice. There was barely any pesto and the chicken was kinda cold. My friend's tatter tots and sweet potato fries were bomb though. \\n\\nI really need to come back and try this place again. I'm looking forward to trying their all day breakfast menu. Hopefully it will turn my opinion around about this place.\", u\"This place is awesome. \\n\\nI'm not kidding while in town I ate here multiple times! Not only is the food good but they consistently have good service. Each time I visited I enjoyed the experience. I almost don't want to rave about them too much because the really good places you don't want the masses to know about. I want to keep this as my own little secret in Brooklyn. But trust me - there will almost always be a line. Stay. It's worth the wait. \\n\\nThere are soooo many different options! No matter what you're craving you'll find it all on the menu. And not to mention it's all good for you. Healthy and Vegan! Also, the portion sizes here are a good size so you'll always leave full. \\n\\nI tried several things and I LOVED them all but some of my favorites were the: buffalo tempeh, gut butster and cauliflower po boy. I also like the salads - you know what I don't have favorites I liked everything! \\n\\nI can't say enough good things. I wish there was one close to where I live. If you're looking for a good and healthy meal. You should absolutely check this place out! You will not regret it.\", u'VEGAN, GLUTEN FREE REVIEW:\\n\\nA definite MUST for all vegans in a 50 - 100 mile radius. Although there aren\\'t too many gluten free menu items, you really only need one: the Benedict.\\n\\nFrom the first bite to the last, I was in some sort of vegan heaven. To be completely fair, I have never had a \"real\" eggs benedict or hollandaise sauce so I can\\'t compare the Benedict to the \"real deal\"...but I wouldn\\'t want to either. The dish was outstanding, and I\\'m not sure what it was. The faux meat, tofu, and gluten free English muffin tasted good, but everything together with the sauce was spectacular. The dish came with a salad and hash browns. The salad was refreshing, but the hash browns were shredded a little too thinly for my liking. Still good, though! My meal was $13 (not including tax/tip), and luckily there was no extra charge for making it gluten free. Yes, it\\'s a bit pricey but it was definitely worth it, especially compared to other meals I\\'ve had in/near the city.\\n\\nService was good - friendly but not overbearing, and they give you an entire pitcher of water so you don\\'t have to wait around for someone to fill your glass! \\n\\nThe two bathrooms are located at the back of the restaurant to the right.\\n\\nI would definitely come again for the Benedict!', u\"AMAZING! It's like a Dennys for vegans. Not the healthiest options (at least what we got) but soooo good! Legit old school home-fries -- the tofu scramble was really, really good. The country fried steak was crispy and pure perfection. \\n\\nWe ordered country fried steak and the pancake slam. Everything was just great. \\n\\nHighly recommended! Whenever we return to Brooklyn we will be sure to stop by here just to try the other items. \\n\\nAlso, we squeezed into free parking right out front at 9:30am!\", u'I just turned vegan recently and this place had raving reviews. I did not hesitate to go. Literally EVERYTHING on the menu is VEGAN. And let me tell you....SO GOOD!! \\n\\nI had a the gut buster burger and fries with a banana creme pie shake. Soooo delicious! The chipotle mayo sauce with the avocados was divine! Will be returning to try other things ;)', u'DELICIOUS. My bf and I came here on a Friday for brunch and the wait was about 45 mins, we were so hungry but figured it was worth the wait.\\n\\nI\\'m new to the plant based lifestyle so I was excited to try the food and see what the hype around this place was about. EVERYTHING is vegan by the way, every single thing on the menu. Should be noted that this is definitely not you\\'re avocado toast w/ a juice type of vegan joint -- this is filling, vegan, diner comfort food with generous portions. I would say this place is a MUST for any vegans/vegetarians in the NYC area. \\n\\nWe ordered the mac and cheese to share, I got the spicy grilled chick\\'n burger with fries and my boyfriend got the loaded breakfast burrito with a biscuit and jelly on the side. My bf who is a meat eater/doesn\\'t care much for clean eating, was blown away. He kept saying \"I can\\'t believe that this is vegan,\" with almost every bite.\\n\\nIt was deliciousssssss I cannot stress it enough. We are super eager to go back and try more things on the menu. BOMB', u\"Went twice in one day! All vegan! Come on how could I resist! Had the French toast in the morning and pulled pork for dinner, I've returned other times and still go with their French toast dish!!!\", u'If you ever Google \"vegan food nyc\" the search results you get would probably be a fancy place or a some new fusion locale. \\n\\nChamp\\'s takes a bite out of the \"trendy vegan\" restaurant market and sets the standard for home comfort food. Literally this is like the Denny\\'s or iHop of vegan eating--that\\'s a compliment. When you want no frills eating, breakfast for dinner, fried foods galore this is your spot. Pancakes (triple-stacked), ice cream, messy sandwiches, burgers, and more.\\n\\nThis is my third time here and I had the French Toast slam which came with food I missed since I stopped eating meat, but just as good. The French toast tasted like the good parts of my childhood and the hashed browns were on point. \\n\\nMy only issue this time around was when we were seated. My friend forgot to mention an extra person and the host made an unusually large deal out of it. Sure, it was our fault but we\\'re paying customers and we just added another paying customer! I\\'m not advocating \"the customer is always right\" mentality--just don\\'t beat the customer over the head for a mistake. However it only took one star from my perception of Champ\\'s.\\n\\nFor a great price, you get amazing home-comfort, all-American, plant-based foods. Definitely a top local for vegans to try (and anyone of course)!', u\"My boyfriend and I were beyond excited to come to this diner. We were pumped up the whole week to try their milkshakes as we've never seen them offered on a vegan menu. Unfortunately, our experience here left us with very mixed feelings. \\n\\nThe restaurant was packed when we walked in which was a good sign since it was outside normal dinner hours. The hostess informed us that the wait would be close to an hour but that we could put our name on the wait list and would be notified by text when our table was ready. We stood near the bar deciding what to do when she told us that we were not allowed to wait inside. This rubbed us the wrong way as it wasn't a request but a demand. We left the restaurant and decided to go somewhere nearby for dinner since the wait was long and it would be a long time before our table was ready. By the time we finished our meal at the other place, our table was ready and so we headed back to give the place another shot. \\n\\nWhen we got back to the restaurant, the hostess did not greet us and just pointed to an empty table. Again, not the warmest attitude. There was a pitcher of water on the table which was nice but there weren't any cups. Our waitress didn't come by for ten minutes and we thought of leaving. She finally came by and we had to ask her for cups for the table. My friend felt that the water was left by accident and not even intended for us.\\n\\nAfter we placed our order, I couldn't help but see all of the delicious food being served around the restaurant. My boyfriend and I ordered the cookie dough milkshake. It was insanely good. It really was incredible. It was refreshing that nothing tasted like coconut, even the whipped cream. There were pieces of cookie dough and chocolate chips in the shake. We wished we ordered two instead of splitting one.\\n\\nThis is a restaurant that I want to start over with and give a better review. I feel that I missed out on a great dining experience. The shake I had was amazing but the experience was not, but because of the shake alone, I would come back to try again.\", u'What sets Champs apart from other all-vegan restaurants is that the food here simply doesn\\'t even LOOK vegan, much less taste like it. It isn\\'t all kale salads here, nope they have all meat-free versions of fried chicken, chicken fried steak, sausage and bacon here as well as very convincing soy based \"scrambled eggs\" that are so good you\\'ll be asking for seconds!\\n\\nI came in here for their breakfast menu. I ordered the Country Breakfast, which consists of a chicken fried \"steak\" made from seitan, scrambled eggs, and a huge helping of hash browns. The \"steak\" was drowned in a really creamy white gravy, and it tasted pretty much like the real thing. The \"scrambled eggs\" were seasoned just right and had a almost creamy, mouth watering feel to them. They were soo good that of course I ordered seconds. \\n\\nWhat I also loved about the place is the choice in music they play. During my stay, I heard N\\'Sync, Blink-182, and Fallout Boy blasted over the speakers. It was like I was transported back in time to junior high school LOL!', u'Within minutes of entering the restaurant, one of the staff members found us seats for my party of three. Once I received the menu I was truly blown away to see the huge variety of vegan options. \\n\\nIt took my family and I ages to finally pick what we should order since everything looked so wonderful. We decided on getting the nachos as an appetizer for the three of us to share. \\n\\nThe nachos were crunchy and flavorful, a drastic difference from the soggy ones I\\'m used to ordering in a typical establishment. Besides cheese, the nacho toppings included an avocado sauce, jalape\\xf1os, olives, and small cubes of onions. Delicious!!! The cheese was funny as opposed to stringy which I didn\\'t mind but thought worth the mention. \\n\\nFor the entrees, my sister ordered the breakfast burrito, my father ordered the gluten free eggs Benedict, and I decided on the Chicken Parmesan sandwich. \\n\\nI won\\'t speak for my sister\\'s and father\\'s dish (though they looked fantastic) but I must say....my sandwich was the BEST I have ever tried, vegan or otherwise. The \"chicken\" was soft and packed with flavor, the marinara sauce was thick and wasn\\'t placed on sparingly. Best of all was the bread which was soft and contained some sort of seasoning. I\\'m not an expert in seasoning so I can\\'t say what they were, all I can say however was that it was a perfect mix of flavor. \\n\\nTo drink a immediately knew I would order the cookie dough milkshake. I didn\\'t regret it. It was filling, and had many chocolate chips sprinkled throughout the whole shake. My only complaint is that there was only two large lumps of cookie dough in the shake. They were so good, I wish I could\\'ve had a couple more. \\n\\nI know this is a longer review then people may be used to me posting but I think it\\'s worth it since the food there was unforgettable.', u\"Upon arrival it was being slammed with a crowd, my friends and I were directed the wait would be a half hour. We ended up getting in a little earlier though we counted the tables that weren't yet wiped down and calculated we could have fit, if the bussers and staff were more diligent. I was happy that our mozzarella stick appetizer came quickly along with the coffee, and continual coffee refills. The drunken cowgirl was awesome however the rest of the meals came cold and subpar. The waitstaff was friendly yet continually forgot simple requests, like a to go container and condiments for the table during our meal. I may give Champs another try, as I've heard a lot of mixed reviews.\", u\"Absolutely amazing! A friend took me here months ago - silly me, I didn't even know it was vegan. You would never know from the menu options. \\n\\nMy favorite is the Buffalo chicken sandwich!\", u\"Challenge: come here as a non-vegan and be BLOWN AWAY by how delicious plant-based / meat-alternatives can be. My sister is a vegan so I knew I should take her.. but I wasn't too psyched at the idea of eating faux-meat. Imagine my surprise when we had a to fight over the rest of the BBQ sandwich. Adorable spot with healthy food and courteous staff - really cool experience, whether or not you're with a vegan.\", u\"The food. Was. Amazing. . \\n\\nI only wish the place were a little bigger so the wait time wouldn't be so brutal but they legit have everything you could want from a diner and more, but better. \\n\\nThe French fries are life, the chipotle mayo is life, and the chik'n sandwich I had was tender and yummy. \\n\\nI was so happy they had a variety of dairy substitutes and not just soy or almond milk for coffee. \\n\\nThe service was very attentive. \\n\\nNote: they do run out of more popular items sometimes during the day. The kitchen was kind enough to make one of their evening items (tatertotchos) a little earlier for me and I'm sooo glad they did. They were epic. \\n\\nCan't believe it took me so long to go and I can't wait to go back!\", u'All vegan! All vegan! All vegan!\\n\\nI\\'ve been a fan of Champs since their original location! (Not to brag or anything..)\\n\\nI recommend this place to everyone when they visit Brooklyn.  This is a place I DREAM about. I\\'ve gone here to eat alone as well as with friends, but ideally I go with people who want to share because I can\\'t possibly eat all the things I want each time I go. Usually I go for breakfast or brunch.\\n\\nI really recommend the benedict for the Hollandaise which is truly incredible. But feel free to take a \"risk\" on something you haven\\'t had before because it may well change your life.\\n\\nAnd of course it\\'s dangerously close to Dun-Well Donuts so why not stop by there?'], u'128.Cocoa Grinder': [u\"I love Cocoa Grinder! My boyfriend and I discovered this cute cafe a few weeks ago when we were looking for a matcha latte at 8:30 at night. Not only was it one of the only cafe's in the neighborhood open late, but the latte's were great. Zule and Zubira, (not sure if I spelled their names right) two sisters who run the place, are also super nice. I'd recommend going here to hang with a friend, grab lunch, do work, and get some caffeine.\", u\"When I imagine a coffee shop, I imagine a large-windowed woodened-floored, cool coffee shop with good coffee, healthy menu options, and chipper employees. This one got it all, a short walk located in Brooklyn near Northstrand Avenue- coffee is pretty good, I got a vanilla latte. Their breakfast menu is especially yummy, my friend and I opted for the granola bowls as the price was right and the portion seemed pretty good- I couldn't even finish the whole thing and it took me three hours of nibbling at my food, perfect morning superfood! I got the nutty banana (overnight oats topped with granola, banana, and peanut butter) and my friend got the bowl with the Nutella (which in my opinion was even better; chocolate based overnight oats topped with granola, bananas, and drizzled with Nutella). This coffee shop was a great study location but a bit cold so bring a light sweater. The staff was super friendly. I admired the female worker (half Lebanese half South American) because she was super nice and sweet to all customers including the homeless who walked in and that says a lot about the person and the people that own the store.\", u'Loving It!  Great big windows. Amazing eats. Good for kids breakfast before school. Open til 9. Delivers yummy sweet potato fries. Run by 2 adorable sisters from cura\\xe7ao  with mama and papa sitting at a table the day of the soft open like they are greeting you in their home. The food is delicious and fills a much needed void in this area. I had an awesome chicken wrap with cantaloupe and yougurt mint dressing which was surprisingly amazing. And also banana pancakes served fast w a crispy edge. Love the vibe. Tons of outlets and free wifi. This place will be a huge success giving bagel pub in Franklin a run for its money.', u\"Iced coffee and iced mocha were delicious, just what we needed on a hot day. They also had an extensive menu and lots of happy-looking customers eating and chatting; I'll be back to try the food. Agree with Alicia S. about the vibe; this  place might have the edge in terms of coffee quality and wide range of menu items: sandwiches, wraps, burgers, omelettes and other egg dishes, oatmeal, waffles, and other brunch classics.\"], u'73.Lua Bar': [u\"Food is AMAZING. Vegetables have never tasted better - cauliflower, Brussels, fingerling potatoes. All done exceptionally well. The potatoes were flattened and crisped. Yum. Pork belly yakitori was perfection. The wings - probably the best I've ever had. I could do without the cold sesame noodles but my bf really enjoyed it. \\n\\nReally interesting spices and flavors. Wouldn't think of a lot of the spices as Japanese but more pan-Asian/Southeast Asian. \\n\\nCash only. $4 beers from 6pm to 8pm.\", u\"So stoked to have this in bushwick.  \\n\\nWhat we have here is a dream come true. Asian styled cheap eats that deliver in quality & flavor.  Good drinks.  Totally affordable.  A little on the heavy side but I'm not mad at that.  \\n\\nFirst pass:\\n\\nCauliflower app\\nPotatoes app\\nPineapple kimchee \\n\\nAll absolutely rocking. \\n\\nThe sliders are excellent.  Had the egg salad & the chorizo.  Perfect balance of crunch - tang - herb.\\n\\nNoodles are extremely good.  Perfect sticky and durable style.   Top shelf.  Broth is dense and packed with flavor, almost too much.  \\n\\nThis place shall replace Yebisu as my ramen staple.  And definitely become a post work - 8pm happy hour joint as well.  A great to place to chill if you're hosting friends in bushwick.  \\n\\n5 motherfucking stars.  Welcome to bushwick.\\n\\n*noted that Stefan dude left a bad review, he's obviously tripping.  He rated Kellogg diner 5 stars.  So that's pretty much s disqualifier for any semblance of quality.\", u'A new \"hip\" place...was excited to go here when I saw that they serve Ramen and the place has kewl atmosphere...really really dark though...had to use a flashlight to see the menu...good music, friendly bartender....but the Ramen: 2 out of 10 This is not traditional Ramen...at least the one I tried, can\\'t speak for the others...small portion which I have no problem with since I can never really finish the usual Ramen portions served in authentic places anyway...but this is just awful \"Ramen\" The broth was terrible and the noodles sub par. I really wanted to like this place as it\\'s close to my house, but their Ramenis some sort of hipsters version of what they think Ramen is...tasteless broth...the pork was a square and had some flavor compare to everything else, but was not great. So disappointed:(  Had to order the butter wings and they were just so, so...gosh, a weird pairing of butter and spicy...the chicken was so,so....just a bit on the rubbery/hard side...terrible:(', u\"This place is fantastic! The watermelon popsicle drink is my favorite drink this summer. The popsicle doesn't melt completely with the drink so I order the beer and tequila shot combo and pour the tequila over the watermelon and then I have a second cocktail. So good! Excellent price for great quality ramen.\", u'Great ramen and drink selection.  Try the spicy boys!', u\"After being a pretty avid diner at Suzume (Lua's sister restaurant in Williamsburg) I was excited to try Lua. I was not disappointed. They are definitely more of a bar vibe than Suzume but the food is not over shadowed. They have a slightly different offering with some great new additions. The General Tso's Cauliflour was really good and both noodles I tried were great. They offer really unique creative craft cocktails at only $9 a piece which is unheard of in Brooklyn and also a pony beer and shot for $6. Overall the vibe and offerings were great and the price was right. $100 for two noodles, two cauliflours, 5 cocktails and 2 beer and a shot combos. I'd say that's pretty amazing in NYC!\", u'So great! The scene is really fun with good music and cool decor. Food is delicious. The yakitoris, cauliflower, wings, and ramen were all amazing.', u'NEW fav late night ramen place!!! Came here with my bf ordered the vegetarian ramen and cold noodle ramen, both were delicious and full of flavor, portions were so big we shared! The staff were so accommodating and lovely, you could see the chef just smiling ear to ear from the open kitchen! Beer+shot $6', u'This spot is a great new addition to the neighborhood. Just opened on Flushing off Morgan and has a dope vibe. The staff is super cute, friendly and fun. I came in with the boo, and was greeted by a bubbly, blonde bartender, we sat at the bar had a couple cocktails and food. The cocktails are awesome, try the Lua punch and Amiga Sandia, those are my favorite so far!  The snacks are amazing too, That cauliflower and spicy boys! Yum! Spam corn dogs! The noodles too, cooked to perfection, we tried the Cold sesame noodle. Perfect for that hot summer night. Very excited for this spot, the pricing is very reasonable for the hood. I know where my man and I will be everyday. Welcome to the neighborhood Lua Bar!', u'I love Suzume so I was really pleased that they opened up a side piece in my neighborhood. Just as good, great cocktails and open till 2! Cha-Ching!', u'Stumbled upon this place a few weeks ago and was very happy I did - the ramen is delicious and the watermelon popsicle cocktails were maybe even better. Really great food/ drinks and fairly inexpensive. Service was fast and friendly as well .. will definitely be back!', u\"New neighborhood spot! Cash only! (ATM inside) My bf and I stopped here on a Thursday night to check it out. Super cute atmosphere. The size is perfect for a neighborhood spot- plus variety of seating (bar, booths, window seats and tables plus standing room). The decor is trendy, dim lights great for casual dates and catching up with friends. The menu features about 5? specialty cocktails, good selection of beers and wine plus small bites and noodles. We ordered the spicy buttery wings, general tso cauliflower, and noboshi bomb noodles. Everything was delish! I never want General Tao's chicken again only cauliflower! The buttery wings are juicy and flavorful and the noodles were very filling and flavorful (splurge to add egg!). I ordered an Aloha punch which was unique. The prices are great here. Overall we are very happy and will definitely return. Definitely a great spot for drinks and snacks. By the end of the review we ordered another cauliflower  Look forward to my next visit!\"], u'97.Ix Caf\\xe9': [u'Wow! Food was amazing. The staff was personal and told us the story behind a lot of plates. Very authentic experience! \\n\\nOne of the persons in our party had a bad allergy, and the chef came out and explained that her dish was safe and he prepared it himself. Always a huge plus. \\n\\nAt one point, the manager was taking our order, and we asked if we could make an alteration to a drink, and she jokingly said \"I could, but I won\\'t!\". We all laughed, and It honestly made the experience better because she explained why the hot cacao was made the way it was and I learned a lot more about South American food and cacao because of it. It made me feel like a regular I guess. The cacao is unreal by the way! \\n\\nThe service was kind of slow, but the experience more that made up for it. \\n\\nI highly recommend checking this place out!', u'- portions are huge\\n  (I soup finish soup and salad)\\n  (salad was re-eaten 3 times, in addition to initial order)\\n- soup is great, btw\\n- great chocolate \\n  (get mocha if ur not into hot chocolate)', u\"Up until yesterday, I had no idea this spot had replaced Tip of the tongue. Nevertheless, this new caf\\xe9 is phenomenal. Guatemalan inspired cuisine. Lovely touches in the decor like the menu design, tapestries on the table, paintings on the wall, a jaguar mural in the back, and the warm blue corn tortillas served with most dishes. The staff and service were the best part of our visit. I liked that they were all from South American. Service was warm and genuine. \\n\\nSo many appealing items on the menu. Their mocha alone deserves its own review section. So rich and thick. I ordered the Rosemary mocha with almond milk. Loved it! And mind you, I'm usually a coffee person, hardly ever interested in mocha. But this was so worth it and satisfying. My husband, being healthy, got the mocha with hot water instead of milk and it still came out tasting great. \\n\\nWe started out with a simple salad to share. It came in a  huge portion size. I had the honey goat cheese omelette with fig, which came with a side of salad and more tortillas. My husband's soup came with a great presentation.\", u\"This is such a charming, friendly stop. It's clean and has a warm decor. The pastries are all fresh baked on sure, and the service is friendly and fast. I am happy we found it.\", u'Rawr. This place is probably one of the healthiest options in this neck of the woods. Dope coffee. Dope food (try the soups too!). Dope people. You know.', u\"Yes! This space is awesome. I almost walked right by it for the billionth time this month before I finally decided to stop in. And I'm so happy I did. Ix Caf\\xe9 recently took over the space of another coffee spot (which I don't remember the name of) so they're relatively new to the space. \\n\\nThe menu is a fusion of Guatemalan, Asian, and European cuisine which makes for an interesting selection. I stuck with a Cubano which came with a side salad ($10) and it was delicious (and filling). I can't wait to give the rest of their menu a try. Kimchi and pancetta on the same sandwich, whaaaaat? \\n\\nThey also offer standard cafe fare like pastries + cookies + la colombe coffee to satisfy all of your sugary, caffeine needs.\", u'Wow! Can I give 10 stars! This unassuming cafe has best espresso and macchiato in prospect leffert area. And the food is insanely good. Incredible diversity of Guatemalan inspired soups and sandwiches. I had the pollo soup with corn, carrots, green beans, potatoes, perfect spices of fresh lime, cilantro and onions to top the soup. The place is a cool respite from the heat with super friendly and interesting team making it happen - do not miss!', u'This is my favorite cafe in PLG. Lots of tasty egg and non-egg options, coffee, cacao, and great service. The staff are super friendly and the chef wears a cute toque (bonus style points).', u'Ordered a croissant to go for $2.50 with an egg and goat cheese for which I was charged another $7.00. Got back to the house and there was no goat cheese. \\n\\nThe restaurant was not busy at all, so I assume it was just negligence. \\n\\nOn the bright side the croissant and egg were nice.', u\"I was looking for a nice brunch spot in the neighbourhood. Oftentimes, I'm walking my dog...get hungry...but can't sit to eat :(\\n\\nI loved that there were posts out front where I could tie my canine companion AND the staff showed Nicky love. I appreciate that. The food was great and the service was fantastic! Oh and that mocha.....DIVINE!!!!!! x\", u\"Was walking around looking for breakfast and this place popped up.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but the omelet I got managed to exceed my expectations. The coffee was good and service was solid overall.\", u\"Smooth dark coffee, not bitter. If you come early you can get the almond croissants, very limited, and not too sweet.\\nHot chocolate made from raw chocolate, add a little spice and float away in it. Most of NYC has never tasted this.\\nThe row of pastries calls me but I can't answer them right now. This will cone in time I am sure. No one tells me where or when, I know it will last forever.\", u\"I downloaded Yelp exclusively to leave a review on this restaurant. The food is great (so far the best I've had in NY) and the server and chef were extremely nice. \\nI wish I could leave 10 stars.\", u\"Guys. Woah. \\n\\nWhen Tip of the Tongue closed, I was super sad. Where would I get my buttery croissants that no one is supposed to know about? \\n\\nI am happy to report that Ix fills this void and more. Great coffee, great brunch food, *ridiculous* soups, and off the hook hot cocoa from the village of the owners. The chef here just moved back from 8 years in Europe, where he had a restaurant that sourced from France, Germany, Italy and more. You can taste this cosmopolitan approach in his food, which is like a love letter to Guatemala written in different languages.  Isn't fusion food just what we need in these divided times?  A fantastic addition to the neighborhood.\", u'The best coffee, smooth, not bitter, it became my morning must have! Their food and pastries are delish! The place is quiet, the service is excellent. There is wifi and power fir your laptop. Great to have this venue in the neighborhood!', u\"They serve La Colombe coffee which is great! But the barista doesn't seem very experienced and OVER heats the milk! The temperature is so hot you can't sip the drink at all ...\\n\\nI wish the service was better too ...\", u'This place is preTTy amazing. I walked past this place a few time before going in and I always assumed it was just another Mexican restaurant/bar just from the looks on the outside. After sitting and working here (yes, free WIFI) for the past 5 hours, I can easily say that they have a great atmosphere. It\\'s not crowded - spacious benches and seating for two all along the wall. There are two high tables towards the back. Uplifting/chill music, South American tapestries, and decor, the waitress is super friendly, and once in a while a young toddler chanting \"cupcake, cupcake, cupcake\". You get that family business vibe here. \\n\\nBest of all, the food is beyond expectations (and for this area, right next to the Q train), it\\'s more than decent. Most menu items are below $12 and you get a range of sandwiches, fresh omelets that look so perfectly oval, hot cacao in 5 different variations, fresh baked goods on the counter, etc. Why doesn\\'t this place have more reviews?', u\"Thank you dear God! Fiiiiinaaaaally good people, really great food, good vibes at this location. Many have tried to create a coffee place/restaurant here and many have failed. I have to say that one of the reason has to be the BAD BAD attitude and weird and awkward vibes, rude staff and rude pretentious prices. No feeling for the neighborhood and it's people.\\nWe have been waiting for this kind of place, for Ix Cafe for more then a decade! Thank you guys!\", u\"This place is great. I've been here a few times and the food and coffee has always been delicious. On my latest visit, I told the employees I was going to be waiting for a friend before ordering and they gave me a carafe of water and a menu while I was waiting at a table. The decor and atmosphere are beautiful and relaxing.\", u\"This place is a pretty cute place if you just want to chill and take a breather. The drinks here with the fresh cacao are delicious. So highly recommend. The staff is super friendly. And it's always nice seeing fresh pastries being put out.\"], u'30.Brasserie S\\xe9oul': [u'Dined here on Saturday, 9/30/2017, with two other Yelp ladies, Alexis M. and Mei C., who I met for the very first time (actually met through Yelp!)  [shoutout, ladies!]. Alexis and Mei chose this place based on the reviews of other Yelpers and wanted to give it a try, as well. \\n\\nWhen I arrived, I was surprised to learn it was connected to the Holiday Inn hotel right next door. I was kind of leery about eating at a hotel restaurant because I thought it would be a tourist trap of some sort with inflated prices. Then, upon entering, I paused again because the whole restaurant was practically empty. The restaurant is large and airy with a modern-industrial d\\xe9cor, but it was 7pm on a Saturday night and I didn\\'t see any other diners. I hoped it wasn\\'t because of the food...\\n\\nAfter finally meeting Alexis and Mei, and chatting up a storm, we got down to the business of ordering. The menu was very sparse, so there wasn\\'t much to choose from. Our waiter, Nikko, explained that the restaurant was under new management and had a new Executive Chef, so the menu was a work in progress. Ohhhhhh...  \\n\\nAfter ordering drinks (no liquor license, yet), running through the specials, and running back and forth between the kitchen and our table to confirm if they \"had it\", poor Nikko finally took our order of Crispy Pork Belly, Salmon, and Steak Frites with country style potatoes. Have to give props  to Nikko for being such a sweet and attentive waiter!\\n\\nAll of the dishes were nicely prepared, delicious, and well-presented. The pork belly had a crispy skin and tender body. It was dressed with saut\\xe9ed kale, baby carrot, and roasted nuts. The salmon was cooked well-done with a leek sauce. I was surprised by how tender the steak was because we ordered it cooked medium-well (I typically like my steaks cooked rare, but deferred to the taste of the others because we were sharing). I thought the steak was going to taste like cardboard, but it was actually delicious! All of the dishes were nicely seasoned and flavorful without being too salty.  \\n\\nBased on the dishes we had, I\\'m curious to see how the new management and Executive Chef revamp the restaurant and menu. I\\'d return just to compare the old and new experiences...', u\"Yay!...What better way to celebrate writing my 200th Review than to provide it on the eatery that is Brasserie Seoul! I am giving them a solid 4 out of 5 stars because of the establishment ' s simple yet elegant ambiance (beautiful lighting), their great customer service and taste of the entrees. \\n\\nMyself and two other fabulous Yelp Friends went here for dinner on a Saturday night. Let me just emphasize again how much I truly enjoy wonderful company, spending time with and having extraordinary conversations with lovely people! They helped to make this dining experience special....thanks Mei C. and Wendy F.! \\n\\nOnce we were all seated promptly, our spectacular server Nikko brought us some complimentary bread. Although we wanted menu items that Brasserie Seoul no longer creates, it was mentioned to us that they are in the process of adding new food items to the menu. The theee of us discussed and decided that sharing would give everyone an opportunity to try various dishes. So, we ordered the Crispy Pork Belly appetizer and the Salmon entree as well as the Steak Frites w/ Country Potatoes. The Crispy Pork Belly was flavorful and the Salomon was tasty. Such juicy, tender Steak and the Potatoes were delicious!\\n\\nNikko was definitely one of the highlights here at Brasserie Seoul. Nikkko demonstrated knowledge of the menu items as well as patience in giving us information to our numerous questions. He always exuded customer service with a smile. \\n\\nThanks to him and the other nice staff persons at Brasserie Seoul for ensuring that a nice time was had by all!\", u'The place is beautiful. Very modern and unique, loved it! \\n\\nFood on the other hand was ok- Maybe because it was restaurant week. Crape came cold and over all, everything else was just ok. \\n\\nIt was good to try it...', u\"This was recently taken back by the hotel.  New owner, new chef, new cuisine. We were their on their opening week and we got free wine. The food was delicious. The burger top with lobster and a side salad was really good. Scallops were cooked to perfection, although the portion size was a bit small for an entree. Salad was good too, a bit of lemon to it and it was perfect. Dessert the cheesecake was good, not too sweet. I didn't care for the chocolate mousse. Excelent service and nice decor. I'd love to come back.\", u\"Walked in trying to find the reception desk so we can get seated.  The waitress was friendly and assisted us to the table. We made reservation and mentioned  Groupon for 9pm but arrived at 8:30pm on a  Saturday night. There was no crowd.  Great ambiance but was a but noisy not due to the music and but people's  conversations.   Very rustic and modern place.  We mentioned Groupon so there was a separate menu for us.  Here's what we ordered:\\n\\nVirgin Volstead cocktail- so good but very sour.  My husband loved it. \\n\\nVirgin Cucumber Sojutini- very good.  Refreshing!  I love this drink. Waitress especically requested to make it virgin for our request.  Very accommending.  \\n\\nCalamari salad-  spicy calamari for my taste but very good. Good portion size.\\n\\nShort rib with shishito peppers- ribs were flavorful but came only warm.  Shishito peppers are not spicy.  Was very good.   \\n\\nDuck confeit bibimbap-  very good-  duck was tender and rice was crispy in the bottom from the hot clay pot.  Lots of veggies Love it. The sauce was perfect.  Light sweet and spicy sauce in the side with half egg and kim chi.  Definitely recommend this dish.  \\n\\nOverall we enjoy our dinner and really appreciate their attentive and accommending service.  It was a great deal going with a Groupon.  Ended up paying $24 cause we tipped 20% (which they deserve for their exceptional good service) and tax.  Not to mention dishes came in big portion.   We definitely return back to try their offers.\", u\"Went with a couple friends on a Friday night. I have heard about this place for a while now and was excited to finally try it. It is difficult as I don't venture into bk often.\\nWe shared the Stuffed Squid (delicious), truffle bulgogi mac & cheese (delicious), duck confit (done exactly at the right amount so the meat was very tender), Wagyu beef burger (it was average) and the mushroom bibimbap (good). For dessert, we had the chocolate dome which was delicious. \\nWe stayed there for a while and they never really kicked us out. It was busy but not packed. Cool decor and vibe. I recommend it if you are in the neighborhood.\", u\"Pretty nice place for lunch or dinner. Food was delicious and staff was accommodating. But I wish the food came out faster. We waited 40 minutes, after we ordered, for our appetizers to come out. And then between our appetizers and entrees, we waited another 30 minutes. Not helpful when I'm hungry haha\\n\\nFood:\\nBeef Short Ribs\\nThey come in two portion sizes, small and large. I ordered a large and it came in this really small cast iron. At first, I was upset cause it was actually really small. But as I was eating, I realized the portion was very generous. Very flavorful and I was full afterwards. \\n\\nCalamari Salad\\nI like calamari a bit more crispy, and I think the salad can be less soggy. \\n\\nCrispy Salmon\\nIt's called the crispy salmon because the rice underneath is crispy instead of sushi rice. Overall, I liked it a lot!\\n\\nDuck Bibimbap\\nDuck was cooked nicely and the entire bowl was pretty flavorful\\n\\nFlounder En Papillote\\nProbably my favorite dish of the night. It came wrapped in paper and the waiter cuts the paper for you. Fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce was on point. I would definitely order it again~\\n\\nFlounder Fish & Chips\\nJust meh. Definitely had better fries elsewhere. \\n\\nMushroom Vol Au Vent with Jang Sauce\\nPretty good~ I liked the sauce a lot!\\n\\nRock Shrimp\\nI love rock shrimp so my opinion may be biased. But these were yummy! The extra dipping sauce may make it a bit more salty though. \\n\\nShishito Peppers\\nJust regular shishito peppers, nothing special~\\n\\nWagyu Beef Burger\\nAlways down for a burger! I don't know what makes the dish french/korean though.\", u\"Ignore previous reviews; that restaurant has closed and now there's a new one, run by the Holiday Inn, but with the same name. No liquor license (expected October).\\n\\nFood is adequate; the tartares were mediocre but entrees were ok. Menu is pretty basic (but well presented) American food with no hint of the previous Korean fusion. \\n\\nService was quite confused. Got nearly raw steaks when we ordered medium; burger patty was cold; it took two requests and 5-10 minutes to get water refilled and again to get ketchup with my burger. \\n\\nFor the same prices as good Brooklyn restaurants (mid-$20s main courses), this place offers uninspired (but perfectly ok) food, confused service, and no liquor license. Skip it.\", u'Brasserie Seoul is somewhat refreshing and a different vibe even for Brooklyn. I can happily report that the food and chef are the read deal folks lol. I found this place on Groupon believe or not. I did my yelp research and liked what I saw and came with a friend to give it a try.\\n\\nMy first and only drink was something the waiter came up with because I was not sure what to get. Its was sooooooooo good so then i asked him what was in it and he said if you come back to visit us again I will let you know (Very smooth line something I would say I like this guy lol) The appetizer of choice was the Calamari Salad and WOW is all I can say. The Calamari was perfectly drenched in this amazing sauce with a little spice but not over bearing to wear you could not enjoy the food itself. \\n\\nWe were given the choice of seating inside basically anywhere since it was not real busy when we arrived. Our server was friendly and pleasant. He was a tad inconsistent with the attentiveness towards us as the guests and we were left alone for long periods of time without being attended to which should not happen in a pretty empty restaurant at the time. \\n\\nThe Entrees were amazing !!!!. I got the \"Hangover Breakfast\" which included eggs, choice of breakfast meat, pancake as well as country potatoes. The food was very fresh tasting and the Pancake was the MVP !!!! LOL one of the best pancakes I ever had with that nice crunch on the edges and tasted marvelous with warm syrup. My friend had the \"Hot Stone Bibimbap\" which I tasted and was healthy tasty goodness. The ambiance was pretty cool. Very clean place some R&B playing not too loud so you enjoy your meal and communicate with your party in a regular tone.. The chef came over and was a cool dude and I let him know personally that he is a BEAST !!!! lol \\n\\nTowards the end of our visit, the service slacked off just slightly. Our server was not coming around as often, and I likened his absence to a quiet encouragement to order more desert perhaps not to sure lol. This was my only complaint based on the overall experience was the inconsistency checking on the guests. I literally had to go find the waiter to wrap up everything so we could go because I had to make my donut run up the street on Flatbush Ave Son !!! lol      \\n\\nThis day turned out to be a wonderful experience overall great AMAZING FOOD !!!. I have to come back and try the dinner menu which looked very sexy as well.(Check Out The Website)\\n\\nTips:\\n\\n1. It is attached to a Holiday Inn you could easily miss the entrance.\\n2. Parking will be a hassle so I recommend taking the train as I do everywhere in NY just easier to get around and one less thing to worry about.\\n3. If you use the Groupon they were a little unorganized so be patient they will eventually get it right lol\\n4. MUST TRY!! For Brunch The Pancakes And Hot Stone Bibimbap #Perfection\\n5. The bathroom is in the Holiday Inn lobby area', u'I came here for a birthday dinner with a group of eight. We had made reservations prior to coming so getting seated was not a problem. Upon arrival, we were given the option to dine in the main dining area or in an alcove outside of the main dining area. We opted for the alcove as it was more private and intimate.\\n\\nWe decided that we would share all the dishes and ordered the following:\\n\\n-Crispy salmon\\n-Beef tartare\\n-Calamari salad\\n-Truffle bulgogi mac and cheese \\n-Beef short ribs\\n-Flounder fish & chips\\n-Roast young chicken\\n-Duck confit bibimbap\\n-Wagyu beef burger\\n\\nOut of all the dishes, my favorites were the beef tartare and truffle bulgogi mac and cheese. The rest of the dishes were good but not anything to write about. I loved that they use Korean rice cakes as their \"mac\" in the mac and cheese. It provided a nice chewy texture that complimented the cheese sauce and truffle flavor. \\n\\nOverall, we had a nice time at Brasserie Seoul. I thought that their appetizers were inventive and nicely executed, while their entrees were just alright. Service was decent but at times awkward. However, our seating arrangement could have been to blame as it was a large booth table, making it difficult to clear plates/fill water for those seated on the inside. The hostess did check up on us several times to make sure we were being looked after since we were seated away from the main action. I would say that Brasserie Seoul would be the perfect place for a date or special event, but it wouldn\\'t be one of my regulars.', u'The food was mostly fine, and the service was good. However, I went here for breakfast and discovered that this location is more \"Holiday Inn\" (the hotel to which the restaurant is attached) and less \"Brasserie\" and even less \"Seoul\" (apparently the place is under new ownership as of three weeks ago and the French aspect is being emphasized more than the Korean).\\n\\nSo while my breakfast sliders tasted fine (though the portion size of the slide of roasted potatoes was quite small), the menu we were handed was a Holiday Inn menu, not a Brasserie Seoul menu. I felt rather silly going to a hotel restaurant that didn\\'t even bother attempting to distinguish itself (at least for breakfast). It would have been nice to know in advance that the restaurant isn\\'t really a standalone entity from the hotel.\\n\\nI can\\'t speak for what the place is like for lunch or dinner, but I\\'ll probably avoid the place for breakfast in the future.', u\"This restaurant has been on my list of ones to try in the Downtown Brooklyn area just because it looked so nice as I drove by in the past. The decor is definitely super modern, inviting and even intimate. I liked the layout and unconventional plate setting. The service was attentive and consistent; the manager was out and about mingling with the patrons. The whole vibe was nice then we started eating.\\n\\nIn general, I am not a fan of fusion restaurants because one flavor usually is sacrificed for the other. In general that's how I felt. The appetizers were definitely Korean and tasty. The main course was good yet culinarily ambiguous. Their side options were not too varied or appetizing. \\n\\nThe experience did get better when our desserts arrived. The desserts were minimal but tasty. Glad that I was able to try it through NYC Restaurant Week because I don't know if I would paid regular for this.\", u\"Restaurant is located inside Holiday Inn with beautiful and modern decor. \\n\\nTook my mom and grandma here for late Mother's day dinner and it was a nice dining experience. We started off with a few cocktails, all fruity and refreshing. For appetizers, we tried crispy salmon and rock shrimp. The crispy salmon was delicious. It's basically raw salmon on top of crispy rice, an awesome combination! The rock shrimp was alright, heavy on the batter so you can hardly taste the shrimp. For entrees, I had the Wagyu beef burger and ordered duck bibimbap and flounder for my mom and grandma. My brother had the hanger steak. All the dishes were prepared beautifully. The service was quite slow as we waited over half an hour for entrees to be served but it was worth the wait when we got our food. My wagyu beef burger was delicious, oozing juice with every bite. It was made medium, the way I like my burgers. I tried the duck bibimbap and it was delicious too. It was served in a hot stone pot, similar to how it would be served in traditional Korean establishments. The hanger steak was very good and flavorful. Normally I'm not a fan of hanger steak because it tends to be chewy but they made it work. The flounder was cooked inside a wrapped paper so definitely unique when the dish came out. However, it was lacking in taste and too soggy for my liking. It was my least favorite dish of the night. \\n\\nOverall, we were stuffed and impressed with the food. Service was good but a bit slow. It's a nice restaurant for dates with their classy decor and romantic vibe.\", u\"Went in for dinner during Restaurant week.. complete fail. I'm mad my sister and I spent $80+ each on a mediocre, somewhat nasty dinner. \\n-- \\n- restaurant was 95% empty when we were seated. \\n\\nAppetizers: \\n- French onion soup - needed more onion, completely one note, way too much cheese\\n- Bulgogi mac and cheese - the bulgogi was tasty but the mac and cheese ... EW. the cheese sauce was not good.. at all. \\n\\nEntrees:\\n- Flat Iron Steak - this was actually tasty. I liked the potatoes and the steak was cooked perfectly. Liked how it was marinated. brussels were delicious as well, but the portion size was ridiculously small. \\n\\n- extra: Duck Confit Bibimbap  $22 - was it worth $22? NO. Was it tasty? Meh. Would I pay for this dish again? No. \\n\\nDessert:\\nDome chocolate dessert - mediocre. like really nothing special at all. \\n\\nCocktails: \\n+ Cucumber sojutini & tropical cloud - both tasted like juice with like no liquor. \\n--- \\nThe food was completely mediocre and just not worth the price. The service was TERRIBLE.\\n- nobody checked on us throughout the meal. The plates were left there sitting for a while and we had to stack them when they brought the entrees because nobody came by even tho the restaurant had like 10 people total in it. \\n\\n- we were trying to get the waiter's attention for over 20 mins to get the check. Every single time we made eye contact with one of the waiter/waitress - they looked away immediately. like shit, just trying to pay the damn bill and be out. The busboys were attentive but still.... i got upset because there's no reason why we should wait so long to get the check when the RESTAURANT IS EMPTY.\\n\\n- a group of hipsters were sat two tables away from us and we definitely noticed that the tables with white patrons were getting serviced... and we were there staring at the fucking ceiling waiting for our check. \\n\\n- how i know it was a race thing: um why do a group of 3 hipsters need 3 waiters to choose a bottle of wine? meanwhile, it's been a hot minute since we've been waving and saying excuse me to get our damn check and fucking leave this place RIGHT NEXT TO WHERE THEY ARE HOVERING OVER THE HIPSTERS.\\n\\n- i was disgusted seeing this preferential treatment [it was damn obvious]... I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS PIECE OF SHIT ESTABLISHMENT.\", u\"I love Asian fusion food and this is perfect. It blends French and Korean in fun ways. I saw some of the creative layout of the dessert photos and I was convinced to try it. I became skeptical when saw it was next to the Holiday Inn; however, the food didn't disappoint.\\n\\nWe shared the wild mushroom & asparagus app as a side and it was delicious  I tried the crusted flounder and my friend tried the duck bibimbap. We were both pleased with our choices. The dessert selection was a challenge since we wanted to try the banana split and the chocolate bomb, but the banana won. It's great for sharing.\", u'Delicious and beautiful. The restaurant was empty and usually that is never a good sign. But it has to be the location because the food was flavorful. French Korean cuisine at its best. In the dumpling dish they had some butter foam...butter. And the salmon crispy was melt in your mouth good. It is worth checking out. NOTE: if you want the brunch menu you have to ask for it when you make reservations. It is not naturally offered.', u'We stumbled onto the awesome brasserje tonight and we were awed by the food! Basically everything on the menu rocks. We tried so many things on the menu from the rock shrimp, the buckwheat crepe, the puff pastry with mushrooms and the crispy salmon as starters and they were well prepared and super tasty.\\n\\n\\nThe japchee and the bib em nap were also amazing, served in the sizzling bowl from the tofu to the duck to the mushroom all were amazing. The Kim Chee salad was also delicious. We had great service and loved this place!', u\"With so many new Korean fusion restaurants opening up this one is okay. Opened right next to the Holiday Inn is this modern restaurant. It is very dark and there are two rooms where people can sit. We sat inside the quieter section with the sky roof. \\n\\nThe French-Korean fusion didn't work well for me here. The portions were small and the dishes we ordered were not Korean and French they were either Korean or French. \\n\\n For the three of us we ordered:\\n1. Crispy salmon sushi appetizer- this was interesting. It's sashimi sushi but the rice ball is fried. You should def try this! \\n2. Jap chae- not as good as the ones you get at a Korean restaurant. I would skip this. \\n3. Duck bibimbap- normal bibimbap but with duck. Very tasty and they give you a lot of red pepper paste for it.\\n4. Duck confit- Also good. The duck was very tender and came right off the bone easily.\\n5. Kalbijim- This was okay. Don't order this. The soup was very sweet. Barely any rice cakes and no rice that comes with it. \\n\\nWine here is pretty expensive the cheapest bottle was still $48. Overall, it was an okay experience. Like other people who mentioned, the waiters didn't seem to know what they were doing. We had multiple times where waiters asked us if we ordered something another table ordered. It also doesn't seem like they know the menu well. Hopefully this will change with time!\", u'The food is amazing here! Apparently the restaurant only use to serve to the guests at the Holiday Inn but now they are open to the public. The decor is so nice with cool lighting, dishware and an open kitchen. Its also a big space and the service is very good.\\n\\nI would recommend any of the Bibimbaps. The mushroom is my favorite, but the duck is also tasty. Its one of the better bibimpaps I have had and comes in a sizzling stone bowl like it is suppose to. The burger is also very good if your looking for something a bit more mainstream. This is the perfect blend of a French-Korean Restaurant.', u\"Best Korean-French restaurant in Brooklyn! Amazing manager, staff and chef. The entire team here welcome you from start to finish. This is my second time here and both times the food was delicious. We ordered the following\\nCalamari salad\\nCrispy salmon\\n\\nGinger salmon\\nWagyu burger\\nDuck bibimbap\\nChicken coq au vin\\nWagyu rib eye steak (no longer on the menu)\\n\\nBaked Alaska\\nChocolate bomb\\n\\nEverything was cooked perfectly and anything not done right was handled immediately by the manager and chef. I love Korean food and Korean French cuisine is definitely a new favorite now. I can't wait to come back for more. Looking forward to many more lunch/dinners.\"], u'140.Bisou Bisou': [u\"Great date spot! My date and I were searching for a quiet and intimate place to chill and have a drink after dinner. This place offers outside seating, indoor seating at a table, or you can lounge on one of two couches. We opted for the couch. The waitresses we're super nice, attentive, but not pushy.\\n\\nWe ordered some drinks and shared the chocolate waffle with coconut cream sauce. I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but the chocolate waffle was fabulous. Light, not too sweet and filling. I wasn't too impressed by the sake lychee cocktail I had, but I had it without the mint that goes with it, so that may have made a difference.\\n\\nThey were busy and the waitress did tell us that our dessert would take a while. After 30 minutes we asked about it and she realized she forgot to put in the order. She immediately apologized and comped my glass of wine and our dessert. That's what I call customer service!\\n\\nOverall, my date and I really enjoyed our time there. We will be back!\", u\"Just meh. \\n\\nCame by for the happy hour. Had a glass of ros\\xe9 for $6. Nothing special. Also had 12 oysters for $1/each for their happy hour deal. The oysters did not taste fresh. They smelled quite fishy and were gritty. They were not cleaned well. Honestly for the oysters and drinks, I would've given 2 stars. However, the service was attentive and the waitress was really nice.\\n\\nI don't have much to say about this place. Other people seem to highly like the food but I can't comment on that but for the happy hour, I'd rather go elsewhere.\", u'Love love love the cappuccino,  especially when Michelle makes it. The food, cocktails, service, ambience and music are all amazing and will keep you coming back for more bisous.', u'This place is a gem. Beautiful setting, nice music, delightful service and the food is delicious. Highly recommend!', u'Brilliant chef true to French crusine at very resonable prices. We were treated so well by the staff and had a wonderful evening under the lights. Sit outside if you can.', u\"This place is a one-of-a-kind find. Most everything about it is intriguing, unexpected, and/or amazing. \\n\\nHere are some of the things we order most: The hearts of romaine salad is probably the simplest thing on the menu, and yet it's a go-to, we order it most every time. The house-smoked salmon on the tartine is one of the most delicious pieces of smoked fish I've ever tried. Their burger comes on a fresh-baked brioche bun, and it's juicy and rich. The ribs (which are not on the menu but seem to be a frequent special), are the perfect blend of smoky, spicy, sweet, and savory. The bountiful bouillabaisse comes in a wooden bowl the size of a small canoe. Then, there is dessert! Save room for dessert, any dessert.\\n\\nThey have only a wine and beer license, so they have come up with some delightful spritzer/cocktails. Our favorite is the San Sebastian. They also offer a small but smart wine list, including a new unfiltered Italian white wine (which paired really well with the scallops they were serving).\\n\\nAlso, pay attention to the music. Best playlist in the neighborhood!\\n\\nBTW: Can't help noticing that some reviewers are perplexed by the fact that it's the by-night alter-ego of wild-mannered Smooch Cafe. They're two very different places, with little in common outside of the decor and the location. You go to Smooch for your casual morning hang, an authentic Flat White (and a tasty Mouthful of Bliss). Then you hit Bisou Bisou for your elegant evening dinner, or early/late drink and snack. \\n\\nThey're just apples and oranges. Or maybe avocados and escargot. :)\", u'Bisou Bisou is a little gem of a diamond in Fort Greene. We went there for a late dinner to be surprised be the amazing ambience & warmness. The menu is minimal yet carefully curated. We had the lamb meatball which was exceptional, full of exotic flavors intertwining with each other perfectly . The truffle chocolate balls are made with true love and everything made me cry... \\n\\nMichelle and Chef Sebastian are wonderful people who tries their best to make you feel welcomed & comfortable. We will definitely come back. But where is this chef from?? Is he hiding from the world?? Is he hiding his magic to himself and Fort Greene? Go there and immerse yourself in their food.', u\"I think these 5 star reviews are fake? Everyone who has praised this restaurant has on average only 3 reviews. \\n\\nGood wine, nice ambiance, polite service. Food is mediocre. Edible if you're hungry (which we were) but disappointing and cold.\", u\"This place is extra special special. I recently moved in next door and for some reason it took me months to try a meal here. Wow. The chef, Sebastian, is a magical wizard of a chef and he makes literally everything from scratch that he puts on every plate from the highest quality of ingredients. After having a few meals here I find myself dreaming of his food. Everything is so delicious - the vegetable platter, the seafood platter, the desserts - haven't had a bad meal here. Then you add in that the owner Michelle is a dream. THEN you throw in good lighting and good tunes and a kind, attentive staff. Everything about my experience here has been extra. Truly one-of-a-kind. Definitely my new favorite neighborhood restaurant. LOVE THIS PLACE!\", u\"This place is seriously underrated. The food is five star. After walking the neighborhood on a Saturday night, and being turned away from popular local spots due to the long wait times. We made our way to Bisou Bisou and had a very delicious meal. The staff is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. Can't wait to go back.\", u\"Bisou Bisou is Brooklyn at its BEST.  From the front of the house to the delightful French cuisine you will be overwhelmed and excited as you \\nPlan next visit.  I love that it's in my backyard and I can stop by anytime.  Michelle and Chef Sebastian are a wonderful team and have a special way of making their guest feel like family.  The food is beyond delicious and is made with love.  Another BROOKLYN GEM.  My new neighborhood spot.

Chef Sebastian really knows his stuff! His desserts are simply divine. If your looking for a small local date spot with some chill vibes....Bisou Bisou FTW.', u\"Innovative spot. Soundtrack is 100% roots, breaks, and disco. Lounge atmosphere but don't overlook the very high quality food. Sea scallops are delicious. Fat fries are doled out in slabs with expert aioli and bourgeois kickin' ketchup. Romaine is nicely finished with cilantro. Star of the show is the lamb Wellington: perfect puffed pastry--crispy and flaky on the outside, slightly doughy and gooey on the inside. Chutney is flavorful and Moroccan inspired, yet not too sweet. Service is compassionate and neighborly. We really recommend!! Hopefully they get a full liquor license at some point...\", u\"I stepped into Bisou Bisou on a hunch that it may have something special: I was wrong, it is something special. The design is is warm and welcoming, the staff is familiarly special and the cuisine is divine. From the hardwood tables, to the wooden platters and wrought iron supports: you can tell someone(s) put their heart into every aspect of the presentation which includes an ambiance that promotes conversation, laughs and satiety. \\n\\nit's a great place to unwind from a hard week, to celebrate a great week, to bring a first date, to bring a loved one, to connect, to re-connect, to decompress, or simply to just be.\\n\\ni left with a desire to return quickly.\", u'What a sexy vibe and tasty food. I go here as much as I can. The staff is always kind + great music. Excellent all around.', u\"My new favorite spot for writing and meeting folks.

Haven't eaten here yet or been here in the evening for wine but the evening vibe seems amazing too.\", u'A delightful spot, with a warm, intimate atmosphere, from the space and decor to the music to the service. The dishes are subtle and thoughtful, hand-crafted by the chef, who stands behind the counter and whose enthusiasm for his work is evident in the lovely flavors and precise execution, as well as his descriptions of the dishes he creates.

Feels like home....'], u'210.Sea Witch': [u\"I love Sea Witch and even moreso love living 2 blocks away from it. It's definitely my go-to bar when I also need to grab a bite. They always have at least 2 sours (my fave) on tap and their selection rotates frequently. The food is maybe not the cheapest but it always hits the spot. I always get the fish tacos and shishito peppers. Carlos at the window is so nice and funny. For brunch they make a killer spicy bloody mary.\\n\\nLovely backyard (though it gets very buggy at dusk; they should provide bugspray and/or get citronella candles) and fun weird decor. The aquarium behind the bar is impressive.\", u\"Sea Witch is truly flaw free.\\n\\nAs many people have mentioned before, the backyard is absolutely lovely. There's a pond, koi, turtles, a very vocal bullfrog, plenty of seating, etc. That said, sitting inside isn't bad either. The ambiance is pretty sexy - great nautical themed artwork, an aquarium with some colorful buddies inside and great seating options both for a group or a date.\\n\\nThe food is definitely worth sampling, too. Love the shishito peppers for something different and the fries for something familiar done exceptionally well. \\n\\nI can't speak highly enough of this space!\", u\"This place has the coolest backyard with a manmade stream and koi pond. It's a very chill atmosphere perfect for after work social gatherings. \\nI usually come here for their fried clams sandwich. You get a generous portion of clams that's not heavily breaded so you can actually taste the clams. The pork schnitzel is also super tasty and not dried at all. I've also had the fish taco and the bluepoint club (fried oysters) and honestly I loved them all.\\nThis is a solid place to eat and drink casually. Also the price point is still moderately decent so that's a plus for great food!\\n\\nUpdate: July 2, 207\\nThe kitchen and establishment has changed a bit and the food is def not as good. Their tacos were downright disappointing. The blue point club was sub par at best. And also they no longer have server service. Oh well, still good if you come for drinks. Cheers!\", u\"Sea Witch is an awesome bar. First off, they have a fantastic selection of local, craft beers. They have beers on tap from breweries like Folksbier and Peekskill. The offering are pretty diverse; they had sour ales, wild ales, stouts, and various IPAs.\\n\\nThe atmosphere and the bartenders were great too. They played some great hip hop. Unfortunately, it was a little too cold to venture out to the outdoor patio, but I'd like to check it out in the summer.\\n\\nThey also have a delicious menu of bar food. It's simple but hits the spot. We shared fried oysters and a grilled cheese sandwich.\", u\"Stopped in here for some happy hour drinks after pizza at Giuseppina's. Wasn't crowded or loud and was lit well enough. Good place to sit and have a conversation. All things that I really enjoy about a bar space. Also really enjoyed the stools. Comfortable and stylish. The decor is mostly hipsterish Brooklyn except for the giant electronic fish tank that kinda looks out of place.\\n\\nHad a few beers to drink, draft and cans. The bartender (don't recall her name), made good recommendations and understand the beer and tap list well. Always a bonus when a place serves beer from breweries you've never tried, as was the case here.\\n\\nWorth a visit if you're looking for a good beer selection or to kill some time.\", u'Great food and laid back vibe even on a saturday night! Only had to wait a few mins for an outdoor table.', u\"Drinks were ok. Food came out cold. Burger wasn't anything to rave about. Pretty disappointed.\", u'The best thing about this spot is the decor and the drinks.  The wall art is pretty cool and its a nice size spot.  The bartender made a good ass drink but he looked like he just came form the sauna. \\n\\nIn the summer with the back door closed and lock plus no fan, Im surprised no one passed the hell out?!?!?  I was like I know I saw this place had an outdoor space...needless to say it was not open!!  Which would not have been a real problem if you had a ceiling fan or hell just go to Target and get a couple of fans to put in the windows?!?!?!  Just so confused cuz the staff looked hot and sweaty.  Not appealing when your service looks like the just been ran thur by the devil?!?!\\n\\nWhen the menu is so simple it should be good but no not even close at the Sea Witch.  Very pricey mediocre/bad food....\\n\\n1. Fish tacos...what was the white stuff on the top...Greek yogurt?!?!  Chef needs major lesson on breading and frying fish...tragic\\n2. Al pastor taco...why do you call them Al pastor....just say pork cuz you are missing leading real taco eaters....HORRIBLE!!!!\\n3. LMAO cheese burger tasted like my six year cousin made it?!?!?!\\n\\nAnd the crowd can get really loud like screaming/hollering loud.  Also I must say the crowd must be very loyal or local cuz aint no way anybody drink in that heat unless the bartender is hooking you up or you live around the block?!?!\\n\\nVery Dissapointed', u\"Right around the corner from where I live, so it's a place I stop by whenever I'm in need of their amazing Fish Sandwich. The guy that works the service counter late nights is hysterical. Super friendly staff, reasonable drinks, and the food is on point. Great little hidden gem in the neighborhood. Back patio area is super cute.\", u'Very chill. Good food, my faves are the burger and fries and schnitzel. Sometimes I get all three. Good beer and bourbon selection.', u'I could have sworn I had been here before sometime last year because everything seemed familiar when I met friends here last week-  The corny decor. Expensive drinks and the bartender who seemed confused about life in general.  Perhaps I am in a mood but I dont see myself coming back to this bar anytime soon.  \\n\\nIf anything it seems more of a summer spot then winter.  Also the fact they serve food and have no real dining area creates an awkward environment for drinkers posted next to the people lame enough to think having their kids eating at what is mostly a bar is appropriate.\\n\\nNo joke a girl who couldnt have been more than 10 was reading with a flashlight at one of the tables while her and her dad waited for their food.', u\"*Don't go sit down and expect someone to come and serve you. That's not how they do it here. \\n\\nWhen you walk in, you'll see 2 guys cooking. This is where you order your food. The menu is written along the wall (just look slightly up). \\n1. Order\\n2. Pay\\n3. Give them your cell # - They will text you when the food is ready\\n4. Wait for text\\n5. Go back and pick up your food\\n6. Bring it to the back patio\\n\\nFood: mediocre & overpriced \\nI ordered fried oysters with mango salsa - 5 pieces for $9.50 & Large fries $4\\n\\nDrinks: order @ the bar - $2 off drafts, well drinks, and wine during happy  hour (5 - 7 PM)\\n-I really like their cider that they had on draft. It wasn't too sweet like other ciders. I forgot the name of it though...\\n\\nWater: there's a huge barrel by the bar with clean cups next to it. serve yourself\\n\\nOutdoor back patio (4 stars): so pretty. mini pond in the corner with fish and a turtle.  \\nIt's also kid friendly. There were a lot of kids on a Friday evening running around and sitting by the pond talking to the turtle. \\n\\nOverall, it's a bar with a nice a outdoor patio in the back. Come for drinks and hang out. Food is just Meh OK.\", u\"Just a cool place.  Great in the fall weather, outside on their deck.  Koi pond wasn't well looked after on our last visit, but I loved our spicy pork tacos and shishito pepper apps.  Just a really cool vibe and place to hang with friends.  More of a grazing, lazy afternoon kind of place.  soggy fries this trip, but we'll be back in the fall\", u'Hidden gem dive bar!  Come for the awesome name and stay for the cheap drinks and fun decor.', u\"Since I have a new bike, this place is more practical for me to drop in.\\nI'm glad I did on this sunny Sunday afternoon, because frozen margarita's and fish tacos were a wonderful respite.  The BLT is still amazing too.   The quality of the food is just wonderful at this price point. Good value. Reasonable portions.\\nThey used to have Shake-shack-like buzzers, but now leave your phone number with the small kitchen, and they will text you when your food is ready. Love that ingenuity.  Thank you.\", u\"Great atmosphere at the back, the food is excellent and the beer selection is quite respectable. Doesn't look like much from the street, but definitely\\u200b a hidden gem\", u'My kind of bar. \\n\\nFunky little place with some cool quirky design choices, a great courtyard, and a few different seating nook and crannies for you to settle into. Had a great night here with a large group of friends that were spread out all over the place. Burgers were ok, not top notch, but decent enough. \\n\\nOther Yelpers may be complaining of the lack of service, (pay at the bar as you go - no need to sort the bill at the end of the night), but as a traveler accustomed to a more laid-back style of service, this just felt like home to me.', u\"Fun bar in South Slope with great beer options, a real aquarium behind the bar, a chill backyard, and fake grass on the walls of the bathroom. I dare you to try to find another place that has all that. Didn't have any of the food, as we were just here to meet up before dinner, but maybe next time.\", u\"We went there because it was in conjunction with an Atlas Obscura event. The music was loud misogynistic rap and club music that was so loud the bartender couldn't hear our order. You definitely couldn't have a conversation with anyone inside unless you wanted to keep screaming. The bathrooms were disgusting. The zen garden in the back was beautiful but there was no wait staff aside from the 2 bartenders so you had to keep getting up to wait at the bar if you wanted anything.  Definitely would not go again.\", u\"Had to change my review of this place... I had originally thought it was such a cute spot and brought my boyfriend back... \\nThe cook must've been in a foul mood because he was very attitudey, I wanted to get my two favorite things -'pickled veggie plate and crab Rangoon - the cook muttered under his breath that they were out of those things;\\nEnded up sharing a few things instead - pork schnitzel sandwich, oyster club and fish tacos - all were pretty lackluster, pork was served on a plain white hamburger bun \\n\\nI still maintain that \\n1. the bartender is nice\\n2. They have a good selection of beers\\n3. The backyard patio is very cute\\n\\nBottom line: come here for drinks but not food\"], u'193.Hudson Jane': [u'Came here for early lunch with a friend. We got the Double Down and the Egg Sandwich with sausage and avocado. Very delicious but a bit on the expensive side.\\nThe waitress and rest of staff were extremely sweet!\\nThis is also a gratuity free establishment so tips are included in the price.', u'Welcome to the neighborhood Hudson Jane! The new restaurant on the block is bright and clean, with seating for about 25. There are outdoor tables while the weather is nice which is great for dog sitting or strollers. The tables are spaced out well, and gives you much more breathing room vs Walters or Martha\\'s. Clean large bathroom, but no changing table.\\n\\nOverall, the food is good and the menu has a gluten free and vegan friendly slant. Brunch was a win with the breakfast sandwich and the vegan \"BLT.\" We loved the home made tater tots. Portions are okay - I left happy. The menu is expensive for some options and could price out some of the neighborhood, but there is a good mix of more affordable choices. I may be interested in trying to come back for dinner, but I wouldn\\'t say I\\'m excited. The space is more memorable than the food.\\n\\nService is very friendly and easy to flag down. They are happy to chat about the menu and the food is delivered pretty quickly.', u'Really nice staff but...... food was incredibly disappointing. Pros: employees are super friendly, prices aren\\'t bad, gratuity is included, coffee was tasty, and the space is super adorable. Cons: the food. We had their hash brown breakfast sandwich and the breakfast burrito. I don\\'t really know how to describe it except that it was really underwhelming. The breakfast burrito felt like something I would make on a lazy Wednesday night, just really really bland. And despite the super small size, I didn\\'t even finish it, it kind of made me loose my appetite. For a place that acts pretentious enough to call their butter \"cow butter\" (wtf) I would expect a little more attention to be payed to the food. \\n\\nBUT: 10/10 would go there for a cup of coffee, really good coffee.', u'Pretty sure one of the ingredients in their sticky buns is crack because these things are DELICIOUS.  Coffee is yummy.  Staff is welcoming.  Space is adorable.  Happy this spot is a block from our new studio.', u\"I was there for dinner last night and the experience was great, the food and service. \\nI ordered an appetizer Chicken skin and guac and a medium plate ceviche of the day. \\nThe chicken skins are crispy and so rich in flavor. \\nThe ceviche is light and refreshing. \\nThe servers were very friendly and they explained the menu well. I know exactly what are in the dish and where the ingredients are from. \\nUnfortunately they don't have the license to serve alcohol yet. \\nI'll certainly go back to try other dishes from their menu and hopefully they have the wines ready.\", u'I wanted to like Hudson Jane, I like the concept.  I understand that the food is more expensive there because they are paying the waiters a real living wage, which I think is great.  I ordered the French toast sticks, which were dry and tasted of salt and too much cinnamon.  I asked if they had syrup and was told it was a dollar extra.  That is all.', u'I\\'ve been a couple times (alone and with others) and I want to like it but the food is bad. Everything else is great. The service is lovely. The atmosphere/space is really beautiful and comfortable. The coffee is totally acceptable. \\n\\nThe sandwich I had for lunch was dry and lacking in flavor/life. The patty melt was an overcooked burger in between two slices of toast, rather than an actual patty melt. The chicken skins with guacamole were OK, but the skins were way over-salted and the jar the guac came in was annoying (the guacamole itself was fine). The \"Double Brown\": if the two hash-browns that make up 80% of the plate were made in the kitchen, I will eat my f*cking hat. Given that, why am I paying $12.50 (or $15 on the menu, which includes tip) for one egg, two small pieces of bacon, and a couple costco-type hash-browns? Do not touch the garnish salad that is served with lots of the dishes. It\\'s been old, wilted, and dry every time and one time it arrived on my plate still very dirty.', u\"We had pretty high hopes coming to this new joint,  and decor was cute and it looked to be a good addition to the neighborhood. Unfortunately the food was pretty average for all of us. I had a bad shrimp (it tasted foul and smelt bad) in my salad, the staff didn't do anything about it. You'd think they would at least replace the salad or comp that salad. Anyhow it caused quite a bit of stomach discomfort for the rest of my day which was frustrating. Hopefully the food gets better or it'll not last in this neighborhood.\", u'I came in when this place first opened for a cup of coffee, I was excited about a new place in the neighborhood.  The coffee was OK but I think Pecks down the street is better.  On my first visit I noticed that they had sandwiches in the glass case, a sad looking 8\" sub wrapped in saran wrap.  To my surprise, the sandwich was $19... why not.  Gross, I think they thought if they threw enough random meats and put it on a bien cuit roll its worth $19.  \\n\\nI should have learned my lesson but I returned later.  Between us, we had the egg sandwich, burrito, double brown, and wheat berry salad.  The food was priced for a restaurant with nicer ambiance and service, not for a cafe setting; which would be fine if the food was great but unfortunately it wasn\\'t.  Most of us didn\\'t finish the food and portions were tiny.  \\n\\nIn summary, this place seems like it\\'s from an episode of Portlandia.  Do yourself a favor and try some nice authentic places on Myrtle that don\\'t try so hard.', u\"cute cafe addition to the neighborhood. I went a couple of weeks ago when they just opened. Had the egg sandwich and chocolate croissant. Egg sandwich was one of the best I've ever had (they use bread and pastries from Bien Cuit which is delicious in it's own right). I knocked off 1 star because their drip coffee was just ok...def not that strong and a bit watery. If they stepped up their coffee game this would be 5 stars all the way.\", u'Good food, quick and friendly service. Outdoor seating was shaded and dog friendly. \\n\\n*Service is included in their pricing.', u\"First time here, drawn in by the Baked Mac and Cheese, and it did not disappoint! I think it was one of the best Mac and Cheeses I've ever eaten. It's a nice, clean restaurant with good, healthy food options. I'll definitely be back!\", u'I love this new neighborhood spot. Wonderful atmosphere with beautiful decor and friendly staff. The wheat berry salad was delicious, I will definitely be back for more.', u'Just finished my first meal from Hudson Jane - a vegan breakfast burrito and it was so, so good. Perfect size and tons of flavor! I will be spending some time plotting my next opportunity to have one. Also the place is really cute!', u\"Opened a few weeks ago, I've been to Hudson Jane twice and am rapidly becoming a big fan.  The first time I had a vegan burrito to go, it was a nice size for breakfast and very tasty, though I wanted more sauce.  Today I went in to sit down for brunch and it was lovely.  They have lots of doors to the outside so although I sat inside, it was breezy and open.  I had the Dutch Baby pancake with fruit and candied nuts with a side of bacon -- the pancake looked exactly as it does in the web site photo, beautiful and really delicious  The bacon was a little thick and a nice complement.  Good coffee -- lovely space, I will be back and hope others will too!  Also looking forward to when they are able to serve wine, which I understand will be soon.  Btw, I only gave four stars because I haven't tried enough items to give a complete rating, and most conscientious businesses usually improve with time anyway.\"], u'168.Menya Jiro': [u\"Lunch date with my wife, we put our expectations on a low down just to try this joint and whoa... food was quick to be served, great tasting Kagoshima and Ibusuki, a bit pricey $14 for the basic Kagoshima ( $15 for ibusuki)  and options to add an egg ($2) and chia suri ( don't know if I spelled it correct) but you're basically good with the basic stuff because as we found out, it's all in the BASICS--noodles were authentic and not your pasty soggy type and the soup base was authentic--I couldn't make this one out and so it must be good! \\nIt's a lunch hour in downtown at 1pm but service was quick and they took card and not just cash. Service was excellent, the two people  manning the service desk/counter were Japanese and were very helpful in showing a first timer like me how it is to order( which was easy as 1-2-3).\\nAll in all, I am going back in this joint because food is great.\", u\"Good ramen - nothing spectacular to write home about, but in a city overrun with innumerable ramen joints dishing up overly salty/fatty/rich/expensive bowls, that's almost a blessing.\\n\\nMenya Jiro's version falls closer to bland (perhaps 'mild' is a more appealing word) than extremely flavorful, but I rather liked it. The noodles are the straight and chewy variety, the broth is not too watery nor too creamy and won't make you want to glug five glasses of water afterwards, the pork is scanty but fatty and tender. I had the Kagoshima, which is the original, but they also have the Ibusuki (soy sauce version) and Sakurajima (spicy). \\n\\nThey don't have a real space as it seems they just moved into half of BentOn's, but BentOn isn't very terrific anyway so it's a good addition. Regardless, it's a quieter, no frills place to have a solid bowl of ramen.\", u\"I am on a mission to find the perfect ramen place in downtown financial district. Menya Jiro comes very very close, but it is much too pricey for a bowl of ramen.\\n\\nThe noodles are the perfect texture, and the broth is just the right side of thick without being too soupy and the right amount of flavoring. But for the basic $15 Kagoshima bowl (including tax), which comes with just 2 very small slices of pork, it's too much. This is what they charge in an actual restaurant with table service and free tea.\\n\\nAlso, the place is not well organized, and very little room to stand when you're waiting for your to-go order.\\n\\nI may come back if I want to splurge, but I doubt it.\", u\"Pricey, unadorned, somewhat, makeshift and scatterbug of a restaurant since there are no real signage nor service. In fact MJ just borrowed space surrendered by BentOn who can presumably no longer sustain their economics.\\n\\nOk that said, it was a stand-out bowl of hot ramen. \\n\\nNo frills, nothing but 2 slabs of pork belly and a handful of scallions in a bowl of miso broth and good noodles with chew. But it didn't look barren, nor did they skimp on flavor that was just right. Ramen-ers, you know how hard it is to achieve perfect flavor... and I believe they have done just that at MJ, I didn't even mind the lack of toppings nor the pricey overhead. \\n\\nTip: don't order the egg... it's a $2 hardboiled brown egg essentially.\", u'Debating between a 3 or 4 stars. Only 3 options on the menu and I picked the ibusuki. I was surprised at how expensive the ramen was after seeing the small portion ($16 something after tax). When the lady behind the counter asked me if I wanted to pay extra $2 dollars for the egg, I thought it was for extra eggs and that it already came with an egg but no. No eggs and no bamboo shoots like the other ramen places. And if you wanted the egg, it will cost you about $18 something dollars after tax which is a bit cray\\n\\nThe ramen was pretty good. Soup was very dense, rich and flavorful. A bit too salty towards the end. The pork slices were marinated nicely and the noddle were cooked just right and chewy. \\n\\nWished they have more options besides just the pork based soup and pork ramen.\\n\\nThis is a more food court ambiance. You order, pick up your order and sit down yourself \\n\\nOverall. A decent place. But think I like Kuu ramen better', u\"Finally some legit ramen in Fidi. \\n\\nUsed to settle for Ramen Kuu (broth sucks, chashu is good) or Ramen&Co (inconsistent quality) but Menya Jiro is better than both.\\n\\nHad the Ibusuki broth, which is a garlicky thicker version of the Kagoshima broth. It is still nothing like the thick viscous tonkotsu sludge that one gets with Hakata style ramen, but is still flavorful and creamy enough to be quite delicious.\\n\\nDidn't like the noodles though, they were the yellow (egg?) type while I prefer the usual thin chewy ones that you can get at places like Ippudo. Chashu was ok; wasnt the melt-in-your-mouth fatty kind. Tamago was a fail for me - the yolk was flavored but wasn't runny, essentially a flavored hard boiled egg. \\n\\nThere are obviously better ramen elsewhere in NYC (like NAKAMURA and YOKOYA) but for snowy nights in FiDi this is good enough.\", u\"Came here as per my coworker's recommendation. It is decent. $14 a bowl. Soup was flavorful and not too thick. Noodle was made just about right. The cha siu was the best and beats the cha siu at many other ramen places! The egg ($2 extra) had some special taste too, not as bland as other places might have made.\\n\\nI would have given 3.5 stars but I round it up. The points are minus because the ramen was good but didn't wow me, and because it's more of fast food type of setting with crappy seating and plastic spoons, not a transitional authentic cozy ramen place type of feel.\", u\"People are nice. A bit crowded but the ramen came out very quick. They need bigger spoons. They seemed a bit overwhelmed but I think it is since they recently opened.\\n\\nThe ibusuki had a fantastic roasted garlic flavor along with their unique broth. It reminded me of a slightly richer but not too rich chicken broth from Nakamura. The noodles were my preference, thicker with a good bite. The pork was quite delicious. Just enough fat and pretty big (quality over quantity.)\\n\\nMy biggest issue is the menu size and the two dollar egg was the hard boiled soy sauce type rather than the runny one I prefer. It doesn't specify this or how many more pieces you get for the extra pork. There wasn't as much a variety in the vegetables either.\\n\\nVery good however. 4.3\", u\"New tasty ramen shop opened in fidi from Kagoshima, their tonkotsu/chicken broth was full of flavor yet lighter due to the blend.  We tried the spicy sakurajima and the premium ibusuki, both were very good with big portions of slightly fatty chashu.  I can see myself switching between the two depending on my mood that day.  It's fast casual so order at the register and get a stamp card because they take care of their frequent diners, after 10 u get 1 free.  So happy it's it came to fidi, where the supply of good restaurants can't keep up with the growing demand.\", u\"Ramen is 4 stars but it's overpriced for what you get. \\nBroth is thick and flavorful however what respectful ramen place charges for an egg ($2 extra)? Especially when the ramen starts at $14. \\n\\nPaid $18.51 for the ibusuki ramen w/ egg. \\n\\nTip: located inside BentOn Cafe\", u\"The service was good, staff friendly, the noodles tasted decent, but for $18, pricey for a bowl of noodles, and they did not add enough noodles. I don't like leaving a restaurant still feeling hungry especially after $18 for a bowl of ramen.\", u\"Soup is above average and the pork is fatty and silky as it should be. I also like that they used the thicker wavy noodles. You have to pay an additional $2 for an egg and it ends up being a hard boiled egg, not even remotely runny. Very disappointing, given that it's still $15 per bowl (+$2) with the ambiance of a high school cafeteria I wouldn't return.\", u\"Went to the soft opening with a bunch of friends. The employees were helpful, and the food was so good! I got the Kagoshima ramen it's soup was pork and chicken, really rich and delicious. The noodles were thicker than normal but really held their own against the rich broth. \\n\\nReally fantastic ramen shop! I'm excited to eat there again.\", u\"7/9 Menya Jiro is a tasty new addition to the neighborhood. The menu is simple with only three options (a spicy and soy sauce option) at $14 a bowl. I added egg to the Kagoshima and the bill topped $17, which felt like a bit much for not much food. If the price was a bit lower I could see myself eating here often.\\n\\nThe ramen was very tasty; I loved the fried onions and the pork is extremely tender. The broth is savory and disappeared fast! I was underwhelmed by the egg. \\n\\nThe space is shared with Benton and I imagine could be pretty busy during lunch. It's pretty quiet and casual during dinner hours.\", u'This is some of the best Ramen I\\'ve had in the FiDi! Great accessibility to where I work.  I enjoyed the \"Ibusuki\" bowl which savory sweetness was delightful to the taste buds. You definitely get what you pay for, delicious food with fast and reliable service. For sure a good spot to do a order ahead to do pick up, will be back again!', u\"I had their ramen at Ramen Lab a few months back and am super excited that they've opened in NYC. \\nFinally had the chance to go and I went with the Kagoshima ramen. Noodles were medium thickness, very good texture. Soup is pork and chicken broth, lighter than the typical tonkotsu, but full of flavor and goodness.\\nChashu was one of my favorite in NYC that I've had. Soy sauce flavoring was really good and so juicy.  Also came with lots of scallion and bean sprouts.\\n\\nI really enjoyed this ramen and I will definitely be back for the other ramens.\\nThis is a cafeteria style shop, so no tip required.\", u'Love this ramen place. The pork tonkatsu is cooked really to perfection. The broth is really flavorful and they give a good amount of noodles. I got the original flavor because I always want to try out with the broth without spice. My friend got the spicy one and it was really good too! \\nThe place is connected to another restaurant in the same location with order and a sit down area. But I like how this ramen place really focuses on just ramen. Now, I know where to get my ramen when I am in the area. I also prefer this place over the other ramen place nearby. \\n\\nIf you are a fan of medium egg yolk, definitely add the egg into your ramen!', u\"This is a chain ramen restaurant originated from Japan. The order is super simple as there are only three options (three different broths). \\n\\nWhenever I first go to a new ramen place, I always go for the original flavor just to taste the broth first. Therefore I ordered the the Kagoshima, a milder pork and chicken broth, which is very flavorful. Another highlight is the pork, it's very tender and juicy. I would definitely pay extra $3 for extra Char Siu Pork as I only got two pieces and they were not enough! The noodles are very chewy, I guess this is a special southern island style from Kagoshima?\\n\\nI gave this place 4 stars because the air conditioner here is not strong enough especially if you are eating noodles and drinking soup.\", u\"I've never been the biggest ramen fan but I will definitely be recommending Menya Jiro to my friends. I ordered their signature ramen. The best part of the bowl is the soup. Rich and flavorful but not so heavy that you'll need a nap after the meal. The one thing I found lacking was that the bowl didn't come with an egg for the not so cheap price tag.\", u\"Pricy ramen with okay flavor. Considering it's in Fidi it might already be the best. But still, the ramen was just not flavorful. The broth was very light. Was expecting it to be better since I saw the high ratings here.\"], u'85.Rain Eatery and Juice Bar': [u'+++\\n- coconut shrimp is fresh, and delicious\\n\\n++\\n- love the protein beast shake, great for post workout\\n- the mixed potatoes are well made, they dont taste fried or greasy\\n\\n+\\n- mixed vegetables are nicely seasoned\\n- had a taste of the mac and cheese. Id recommend that as well', u'Great lil spot. Emphasis on little. It only seats 4 which is a shame cuz the food and soulful oldies will make you want to get comfortable. \\n\\nI ordered the wild caught salmon (all the seafood is wild caught actually) for $12 it came with two sides. I got the spinach and plantains. They also threw in a small piece of corn. \\n\\nIt was so delicious the fish was well season and well cooked. A lil crispy from the grill (or pan idk) on the outside while still juicy and flaky. Their was a pretty healthy portion of plantain that werent too sweet and a generous helping of spinach. The spinach and plantain tasted super healthy (aka I dont think they were lathered in butter or salt like you might find elsewhere). I really enjoyed the meal and plan on coming back to taste the rest of their menu items.', u\"Small interior. Only 4 stools. Simple decor but their laid back atmosphere draws you in. I found their menu  appealing. Plus the staff was engaging and friendly. \\n\\nFor lunch, I ordered the wild caught coconut shrimp. It came with like 6 pieces of shrimp. I heard them cooking it which was a good sign. Since it didn't come with any sides, I ordered the Mac & cheese and the corn on the cob. Honestly I wasn't that full, I could have been fine with the corn on the cob. The Mac n cheese was delicious, well seasoned. They gave me a big piece of corn, super juicy. Overall, I was a big fan of their cooking . Felt like ordering from someone's kitchen. Oh, and the island breeze made with mango, pineapple made a great smoothie, good size.  Would see myself coming back, mostly to try their other dishes.\", u\"This is probably my favorite joint in the whole city! 100% authentic, delicious food made with absolute love!!! Be sure to try something new every time you order! Healthy juices and punches made to your hearts desire- it's a food fanatics dream! Also perfect for anyone trying to change to a healthier diet and lifestyle. Try something new from their very own #Trinidadian chef! Enjoy!!\", u'Found this place on yelp and I must say it is well worth the 5 stars. Although a little small (the reviewers warned me of this), the food and customer service truly made up for it. I ordered the Island Breeze and The Bing juices; both were pretty tasty. I also ordered Wild caught Salmon with Mac&Cheese, mixed veggies, and roasted white/sweet potatoes. The portions was large enough to satisfy me and my daughter. I say definitely stop by and grab a bite.', u'I eat here all the time.. great clean-style Caribbean food, so tasty, so fresh, and always consistent. That spicy sauce too!', u'My new favorite spot. The fish sandwich is phenomenal. The salmon so tasty and the service is friendly. I plan to slowly work my way through the entire menu.', u\"It's so great to have such an establishment in the neighborhood. This meal was just what I needed on a rainy lazy Saturday. Yes it is a tad pricey but the food is fresh, flavorful, and healthy.\\n\\nGrilled Snapper with Pineapple sauce-  this fish was absolutely delicious. It was well seasoned and spicy with a good crispy skin and that pineapple sauce was absolutely mouth watering.\\n\\nMac and Cheese- solid Mac, good texture and flavor\\n\\nSpinach- well saut\\xe9d and seasoned\\n\\nBanana Bread- was a little dry but it tasted sooooo good\\n\\nOverall I would eat here again\", u'Really close to home. On a nice Saturday morning I come here for an Apple, Carrot, Orange juice and Grilled Salmon.\\n\\nPros- Price-Food- Small/Intimate-Healthy\\n\\nCons- Everything is fresh so it takes time\\n\\nStill deserves 5stars.', u\"That's What's Up! Finally someone gets that a smoothie should be more health than wealth! The Beast Mode is made on premises by Kevin and after a few sips you can take on your routine at Wingate (you know who you are!). Respect! \\nP.s. Expand your smoothie menu and add some grilled chicken breast sandwiches!\", u'Today was my first time ordering from this establishment..i was just tired of the usual foods and wanted something different...this was exactly what i needed. I ordered the salmon, corn on the cob and mix veggies..the presentation was decent..nice, neat and simple.. I must admit the amount of food leaves more to be desired but i understand it really is a proper proportion for a meal. The food was simple looking but packed with flavor which i did not expect...yes the food is expensive and i may not buy on a regular basis but my family will definately be ordering again asap. I also ordered a sea moss drink but i think it was blended with fruits etc..i was not expecting that and just wanted plain sea moss. I have not tasted it so i cant rate it as yet. But all in all this restaurant is something new and exciting to try.\\nAs far as the food serving size goes i think it depends on what you order on how much food you get because there were 3 orders for my house..2 were a good serving size and 1 was very small.. But each meal was good.', u\"The crab soup is A1 and the owner and his daughter are mad funny and chill. I usually don't come to Brooklyn but had to come for this restaurant, try it out if you are in the area\", u'This place is the best! Had a delicious coconut drop, as well as incredible coconut shrimp. Fun place to hangout and people watch, cool interiors, great music...terrific staff!', u'Good vibes here and amazing food. Invest in the food that you eat. This is the place. Great healthy food', u'I stopped in today because I\\'m tired of the usual pickings in the neighborhood and there\\'s oh but so much jerk chicken, beef paties (Jamaican, Haitian or Guyanese) and roti that a human can have in the vicinity. With that being said, Rain Eatery had to be my saving grace, one way or another. \\n\\nI ordered the signature fish and chips from Steven, who greeted me with a smile and was extremely personable. There were some yummy looking pastries in the front (coconut drops, banana bread and a \"come and get me NOW\" strawberry cheesecake that was glistening with the lights dimmed.......HELLOOOOOO! \\n\\nMy friend ordered an Island Breeze, a smoothie made with fresh mangoes, strawberries and pineapples.\\n\\nWe waited less than 15 minutes and everything was made fresh, presented well and packaged to go! \\n\\nThe mom-to-be in me could NOT leave without those moist coconut drops (2 for $3) and a slice of banana bread. My little princess was doing the \"Harlem Shake\" when she saw them so, I had to get her a few ( I know, blame it on the baby!). I also had the great pleasure of meeting Kevin, who bakes all of those decadent treats and cooks, who swore that I\\'ll be in love. And wait......HE\\'S A NICE LOOKING TRINI MAN TOO! Coconut drops and eye candy is a combination! Allyuh go support this new eatery and check out Mr. Kevin too! Support black owned businesses! I can\\'t stress it enough.......SUPPORT BLACK BUSINESSES! \\n\\nWhen the food is fresh, the oil is clean, you are greeted with respect and courtesy AND the staff is good looking.........................GO BUY SOMETHING.....I don\\'t care if it\\'s a rice grain! SUPPORT BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES! \\n\\nBaby and I will be returning! \\n\\nWishing \"Super Sweet\" Steven, \"Trini\" Kevin and the staff of Rain Eatery much success in the community! \\n\\nWarmest,\\n\\nAisha & MINI Aisha (*waving Jamaican flag*)\\n\\nTHANKS GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!', u\"I give this place this rating because I think it's a rip off! I support black owned by business myself and there should be much more in that neighborhood if you asked me but for the little bit of food they serve for such a high price is ridiculous!! Don't get me wrong the food is made fresh and it's taste good but they take for ever to make it. One time I bought salmon asparagus macaroni pie with baby potatoes and it came up to $15 if I added the coconut shrimp it would've been $27. It they make baby shrimp not even jumbo. And I don't believe the food is wild caught seafood. They lead ppl to believe so so their prices can be high. The prices for the juices and smoothies forget. I rather make my own! They start from $8 to $10 and up. There another Resturant in the area called PLJ who's smoothies are great and every he thing makes there is organic and his smoothies start $4 to $5 and up. I'm think that rain prices for the smoothies are high because they use a vitamix!!! This is not a 5star Resturant it's a hole in the wall restaurant. Yes we need more black owned Restaurants but at the same time dont leave us broke. Get it together with these prices...\"], u'148.Brooklyn Wing House': [u\"Ahhh BK wing house.. I contemplated between 3 and 4 stars, because you truly felt like 3.5 (cmon yelp, incorporate half stars for the indecisive!), but I went up to 4 because the Wings were truly that good. But we'll get the that later. \\n\\nSo I decided to travel here after work this week after seeing some hype on social media and deciding I had to give it a try myself and of course support a local, black owned business. The shop is small but pretty easy to find. There's a little bench to sit and wait for your food on but it's not a place you can grab food and sit. The first half of star was deducted the moment I walked in and wasn't greeted. Especially because the young woman behind the counter looked directly at me and continued placing utensils in a bag. I feel like it's standard customer service to at least say hello when someone entered. I stood at the register for about 2 minutes before she finished and finally acknowledged me. That's strike one. I decided to try a 6 piece of the  Wings with the Sweet chili rum sauce, and also an oxtail empanada. Surprisingly my food was ready in under 10 minutes. It was also super quiet in there so maybe I lucked out on the wait time. \\n\\nNow for the food. The oxtail empanada was gross! I'm just gonna say it straight like that because that's the first and only word that comes to mind. Whoever made it clearly isn't an empanada connoisseur because it was kinda lopsided and the shape was weird, def not the perfect empanada shape. But the oxtail inside had 0 flavor, and there was potato in there (who has potato with oxtail?) and even the potato was flavorless. It was just a No for me dawg. But thankfully the wings were a saving grace. That chilli rum sauce was the BOMB! It had a nice spicy kick to it and the sauce and chicken was super flavorful. I wish i would've skipped the empanada and gotten more wings instead. I was dang near chewing the bone y'all, not exaggerating. \\n\\nI'm going back to give them another chance because of those wings alone and to try some other flavors like ciroc mango habanero. But please, just get rid of the oxtail empanada. Please!\", u\"Ehh. Not blown away. \\n\\nI ordered garlic parmesan wings. The sauce on the wings were good but I wish the chicken itself was seasoned a little more. I guess I got lucky because the wait for my food was only 10 or so minutes. I'll go back to try their other flavors. Maybe I'll have a better experience next time.\", u\"The wait time was super long. 43 minutes to be exact.\\nOur order was incorrect.\\nThe wings were fried too hard.\\nThe sweet potato fries were soggy.\\nThe seasoned waffle fries (which we didn't order) were soggy.\\nThe food sat packaged for 4 minutes or so before we had to ask if it was ours and receive it.\\n\\nThe sauce on the wings was really good though.\", u'After visiting this location the first time and they were half closed 2 hours after they were scheduled to be open, I decided to give them another try.  First the store was filled with at least 10 people with work shirts huddled in front the registrar.  Then when I get to the register there is a sign with all the food that they are \"sold out\" only 2 hours after they opened. It sounded more like it was never cooked for today. Like 6 items and the store was far from packed.  \\n\\nFood took a reasonable time to cook about 10 minutes but the chicken was horribly over cooked.  The shrimp we ordered had minimal sauce on it. \\n\\nJust disgusted that our local black owned businesses can\\'t do better.  It never fails that they don\\'t have food or good service.', u\"Today August 19, 2017 marks the grand opening of Brooklyn Wing House. Open today from 12pm until whenever they decide closing assuming 11pm. This is my third time trying Brooklyn Wing House as they've had numerous small soft openings this week. Today I ordered what I would consider to be one of my favorites the sweet chili wings with waffle fries. My boyfriend elected to have the fried catfish sandwich with an order of waffles fries. The order was placed 1:12 and we received our orders at 1:45pm. The cashier and various employees kept us informed. Let me say that every thing is made fresh so that was a decent amount of time I feel receiving our order. Let's talk about the food!!!\\n\\n\\nThe sweet chili pepper\\n\\nI have had Boneless and with bones are amazing. The first bite I can tell the wings are marinated and seasoned to perfection. \\n\\nThe Fried Catfish Sandwich\\n\\nTakes a little time to be prepared but definitely worth the wait. The biscuit was made from scratch. My first time ever trying catfish and it was seasoned well and delicious. I love the collard greens smothered in turkey as an addition. \\n \\nI definitely plan to try other items on the menu everything is pretty appetizing. Another great addition to Brooklyn and New York overall.\", u\"I'll start off by saying that I've been waiting for a wing spot to come to this neighborhood. When I heard this place was opening three blocks away, I couldn't wait to try it! So when I got a chance today, I was underwhelmed. But I reserve the right to update this review after another visit.\\n\\nWe ordered the chicken and waffles, along with a 9 piece of the sweet chilli rum wings. The chicken was well seasoned and the wings were delicious, but the waffles were not crispy enough. Also you sell chicken, why don't you have hot sauce? Confused.\\n\\nOn the service front, it took 35 minutes to get our food. I get it. It's opening weekend and you're still figuring it out. But that's why you had a soft opening. You should've anticipated this rush based on what you saw last week. They ran out of so many things already, it's almost like they shouldn't be open just yet. Their customer service is lacking.\\n\\nAll that being said, I will go back and support. I'll give them a month to get it together.\", u\"Heard some buzz on social media and stumbled across their Instagram page today. I saw that they were doing a soft opening so I wanted to stop by and support. They didn't have the full menu but enough options to try. \\n\\nI ordered lemon pepper wings (6 pcs for my mom b/c I'm a vegetarian), waffle fries, and fried mac balls. My mother is EXTREMELY picky when it comes to eating other ppl's chicken. She smelled and examined it for a good 5 mins before eating. She ended up really enjoying it and loved the tangy flavor. \\n\\nThe mac balls were also great. The waffle fries really hit the spot though! \\n\\nThe staff is friendly and the location is accessible (3 train to Nostrand). I can see this being a really successful addition to B.O.Bs in Crown Heights.\", u\"Okay first of all, i heard about this place randomly from black tumblr. And? My life has been changed and im not going back to any other wing joints like excuse me ciroc infused/rum glaze/smoked bbq sauce *and* the chicken cooked to perfection? How. Also the shrimp: tastey af. Waffles? Heaven. I will not stop until i have had one of everything on the menu!\\nWith that being said, like many black owned places with delicious food, they be running out of stuff mad early and their opening time is 'flexible.' So it may take me awhile and i will be doing a couple of trips - watch me.\\nI dont even care about inconsistent customer service experiences this is the spot im ready.\", u'A bunch of sycophants leaving reviews for their friends it seems like.. \\n--- \\nI ordered for pickup on Friday 9/1/17 an hour before I was actually going to pick up because apparently, they take forever.\\n-- \\nFOOD:\\n- mac and cheese balls: mediocre at best. it aint that hard to make a decent mac and cheese and form it into a ball. needed more flavor imo. \\n\\n- garlic parmesan wings: tasted more like ranch. barely any garlic taste with a sad sprinkle of parmesan cheese on top. meh.\\n\\n- lemon pepper wings: just no. this didn\\'t taste like anything tbh. just fried up wings. there was absolutely no flavor. \\n\\n- jerk wings: it was alright. of all the wings, the jerk wings had the best taste but the flavor still wasn\\'t that permeated through the meat like a good jerk chicken should be.. I\\'m West Indian and have eaten jerk chicken my whole life so i know what it is..\\n\\n*um these wings are extremely small.. 24 small ass wings for $25? nah.\\n--\\nSERVICE:\\n- they\\'re supposed to be open at 12 according to the internet, but weren\\'t open until 2:15? That isn\\'t the way to run a business... \\n- the girl at the front was legit confused. \\n- when i was placing my order, I wanted to order the rasta pasta bites, and apparently they were out. \\n- how are you out of items when you literally opened less than an hour ago? are yall just not making it and saying you\\'re out? stop it 5. \\n- the girl at the front said oh we\\'re out of it, look at the chalkboard - it wasn\\'t even written on the chalkboard of items they had \"sold out\" of so... \\n\\nPICKUP:\\n- there needs to be some kind of plan/order implemented by the staff working here so people aren\\'t just standing around.\\n- i went up to the counter and there were at least 4 people up there just standing around. You should be asking me, the customer, if i\\'m being helped.. \\n- i didn\\'t come into the place to stare at the walls... i\\'m here to pick up food. \\n----------------------------------------------\\nCustomer service is completely lacking tbh. Food is mediocre at best and they need to do better. All this hype around this place and it fails on every level.  \\n\\nThe food could be better. Wings are minuscule for the price point and the service just ain\\'t there. One star for the jerk flavor, and one star for the wings being juicy. Probably won\\'t patronize them again bcuz i feel like the meal wasn\\'t worth the $35 i spent here.', u\"I'd like to give an update to my review upon going my third time. These are things I think they can improve on.\\n\\nThere twitter says they close at 12pm, but in store they said 9pm. I don't know if thats been updated yet, but its something to note. Upon checking there twitter now, it says they close at 10pm now. So I don't know whats going on with that honestly. Secondly I will say the customer service is definitely lacking. I asked them on twitter if they were going to be open yesterday, they replied to me and said yes. I travelled about 30 mins just to get there and see that they were closed. That was highly annoying and a waste of my time. When you call the phone number, it just rings out and never gets answered. I've also noticed them being rude to customers on their twitter account. As a business, you can't stoop to a lower level and argue with customers. Being professional is key always, especially as a black owned business where people are EXPECTING you to do that sorta thing. Its just not a good look. There food time can also be improved. They've been open maybe 2 weeks almost 3 weeks now. Theres at least 4-6 people in that kitchen. It shouldn't take 45 minutes for me to get wings. I get that you guys drop them fresh to order,  but the food there serving shouldn't take 45 mins to make. So either the kitchen staff needs to be more organized or chicken should be getting dropped regardless in anticipation since they seem to always have a line. Maybe have someone outside taking order or even having two registers. Something has to change or this amazing business will lose its crowd very fast. My last time going there, they were also sold out of a lot of the sauces and certain foods. I think its pointless to advertise something if its going to be sold out towards the end of the day. As a new business, you can't really afford to not have something. You limit your customers choices and that might make them not want to order entirely. So I think more care should be taken when it comes to buying inventory and accounting for the more popular sauces and other food items. Lastly, I'll go back to the store being open thing. If you say your going to open Monday to Sunday at 1pm, be open! I shouldn't have to check your twitter to see if your going to be open on a Tuesday afternoon. You should be open! I hope they see this review and take something from it and try and implement some new things. The food is good. Now just get the business part right.\", u\"Listen. I really wanted to support this place with a 5 star rating. I'm a resident of the neighborhood and I was excited about the place, also very few black owned businesses around here so I was rooting for them.  \\n\\nTried it twice. Once placing an order in person and waiting for it, once over Uber Eats for delivery. The in-person was fine. Took about 30 mins for an uncomplicated order of fries and 12 wings. When I opened the bag at home, they forgot the fries. Tried calling - no one picked up. \\n\\nThe delivery was awful. Over an hour and a half for a delivery of about 4 blocks, again only 12 wings no fries this time. I would've gone to get it but when I called to check the status, no one ever answered.\\n\\nThat being said, the wings are good. Just not sure they're worth the wait.\\n\\n*I honestly would like to be able to come back and edit this review with a 5 star rating if they make some improvements. Hoping management sees this so that they can make adjustments and be an awesome spot in the neighborhood.\", u\"I ordered an order of Buffalo Wings Sweet Potatoe fries and Dusse Wings. Although they forgot my buffalo wings I still have to give them a good review. This place is almost always busy and that's because their wings are phenomenal. I had a chance to try a few of the wing flavors but I would highly recommend the Dusse wings. The staff was friendly and the wait for the food wasn't that long.\", u\"Great wings!! My favorites flavors so far include the pineapple teriyaki and sweet chili rum glazed. Mac and cheese balls are cool. The passion fruit juice is tasty. Wait time could use improvement but it's not the worst. It's a new business so I'm sure they have to work out the kinks. Will definitely go back. Supporting black owned all the way\", u\"I went on opening night, which sounded great in theory (support small business), but was a bad idea in practice. They were simply overwhelmed. Between standing on line, ordering food and waiting for its preparation, I spent 2 hours there. I ordered the boneless lemon pepper strips, dusse infused wings and the oxtail empanada, but I was so hungry and irate that I honestly couldn't will myself to fully enjoy the food. \\n\\nI plan on returning again soon when I am not as tired or hungry and will give a fairer assessment of the food and service then.\", u'I visited BWH on their grand opening day. \\n\\n I ordered the pineapple teriyaki wings (6pc) with the red velvet waffles .. because I was so indecisive on what to get, I also order 8 pc fried shrimp and 6 pc Jerk wings. - there was so many different options to choose from!\\n\\nWhile waiting on my food I was speaking with the owner .. I think his name was Dave... He was very nice and polite. He went over the items on the menu with me and suggested that I try the pineapple teriyaki wings which ended up being a great choice.\\n\\nLet me start with the food was amazing!!! The pineapple teriyaki was my favorite, it well seasoned and the sauce was to die for. I mean finger licking good LOL ..There was a nice balance between the two combined flavors. The chicken was cooked to perfection and fresh, it was nicely paired with the red velvet waffles. \\n\\nThe jerk wings had a nice original Caribbean flavor... it was not over bearing with spice, to me it was just right. I was able to enjoy the wings without needing any additional sauces because it was packed with more than enough flavor.\\n\\nThe fried shrimp was fried in a nice seasoned batter and was golden - another favorite.\\n\\nMake sure to the get passion fruit lemonade \\n\\nSadly I have no pictures of my food because I devoured it so quickly. \\n\\nI can see this business having an successful future because the food and service was excellent.\\n\\nI will definitely be back to try the other items.', u\"Black owned \\nGreat customer service \\nFlavor variety\\nDelicious wings \\n\\nBrooklyn Wing House is just what the neighborhood needed. I came to the area to pick up dinner from another place I frequent,   but  to my disappointment they didn't have anything appetizing.  Discovered BWH by accident and decided to give it a try. I was inforned today was their soft opening and although official menus wouldnt be available until tomorrow they would be serving a number of items. A gentleman (not sure if he was the owner) ran down the menu and it was plentiful for a soft opening. I didn't get a chance to go inside because the gentleman was nice enough to take my order from the car and bring it to me when it was done. We went with, tamrind, mango haberno and lemon pepper wings with mac n cheese balls. One word.....FLAVOR! These are not your ordinary wings. They are packed with flavor, fresh and cooked perfectly. The prices are fair and certainly worth every penny. I hope these guys stick around. If your in the mood for wings be sure to check them out. I will definitely be returning!\", u\"Finally a good wing spot in my neighborhood. I saw a line forming and wanted to see what the hype was about. The food pics looked amazing so I decided to try and they did not lie! I hadthe red velvet waffles with shrimp and had a foodgasm. My gf got wings and said they were some of the best she's had. I tried one and it reminded me of the wing spots in ATL.\\n\\nThe restaurant was clean and the staff was helpful. The owner seems pretty cool. I did have to wait a little while for my food but nothing too crazy. Good prices, good food. I'll definitely be back.\", u'Let me start off by saying that I really wanted to give 1 star, but I decided to be nice and give 2 because the wings are good. I tried calling around 8 to place an order however either they don\\'t have a phone or they are just straight up ignoring it because no one ever answered and it never went to voicemail. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I pulled up and the first thing he says is \"forget it babe, there\\'s a line\". I should have listened to him, but I was hungry (just getting off work) and had been wanting to try this spot since they opened. Anyway I go inside and order within 5 mins. It was 8:32 pm. I ordered 18 wings and a side of fries. The fries are nothing special by the way. After paying I asked the girl who took my order how long it would be and she said 25-30 mins. \\n\\nI left and got back in my car and went to get gas etc. I get back exactly at 9:10 just knowing for sure they would be ready because she said 30 mins tops. I go to the counter and I tell her my order number and she said that order isn\\'t ready yet. I said it\\'s almost been 40 mins how is it not ready yet? She\\'s just standing there looking at me as if I was speaking another language. Another girl and guy from the kitchen come up and tell me it\\'s going to be another 15-20 mins. \"We are dropping fresh wings now\". The guy went on to apologize and say that he\\'s very backed up and will try to get them out to me as quickly as possible. So many customers looked upset waiting for their food. As I\\'m waiting the girl who took my order decided to take it upon herself to address the crowd (in a very defensive manner btw) about how they make everything fresh to order and that they don\\'t have food just sitting out. That\\'s all fine and dandy, but don\\'t tell a customer their food will be ready in 30 mins or less and then when they don\\'t get it until an hour later after initially placing the order you are wondering why they are upset...just rude. I guess some people have never heard of the saying it\\'s not what you say, but how you say it. I didn\\'t get my wings until 9:33. \\n\\nThe wings are good, but not good enough to wait an hour. They were sold out of half the flavors they offer for the wings on their menu and have too many people on staff literally just standing around while customers are waiting for an hour or more to pick up their food. If you have all the time in the world and the patience to match then hit up this spot and if not keep it pushing. I know it just recently opened, but they need to get it together. FYI customer service is key for any business, but especially for a small business to thrive and again you just opened...got to do better. Professionalism and organization go hand and hand with customer service and that is where they are lacking.\\n\\nSide note: I\\'m really not one to leave bad reviews or bash an establishment over petty trivial nonsense. I\\'m all about uplifting and passing on positive feedback, but this particular situation tonight didn\\'t sit well with me and I had to let fellow yelpers know!', u'I visited Brooklyn Wings House this afternoon 08/16/2017 @7:04pm . I got my order @ 7:54pm. This place just recently opened so I know things will be a little out of control for a while but to wait 50 mins is ridiculous. \\nI ordered 2piece taramind glaze chicken and waffle and instead got plain chicken . The kitchen which can be easily view had about 6 cook yet the food order was a verrrry long wait .  The chicken and waffle was delicious', u\"Wings were horribly disappointing..... apart from them being overcooked, the flavors were nothing but glamorized descriptions of either over salted/ or overly spicy corner store food... so sad expected so much more but can't blame them, young inexperienced entrepreneurs, mistakes are expected I hope they take this criticism as just that.... also the phone staff was very unprofessional when I placed my order... money wasted in my opinion, good luck to all others   \\nCheers\"], u'37.Blueprint': [u'Almost hidden amongst the plethora of hip restaurants and bars on 5th Ave, Blueprint is most definitely a place you shouldn\\'t overlook! Upon entering you\\'re immediately struck with the ambient atmosphere, giving it almost a speakeasy sort of vibe. \\n\\nA friend and I came on a Thursday night for a celebratory \"It\\'s Almost the End of the Week\" cocktail. Our bartender was incredibly friendly and suggested a few drinks that he thought we\\'d like upon hearing our preferences. I ordered the Minotauro while my friend went for The Doctor. Hands down, my drink won! \\n\\nBoth were amazing of course, but I have to say the Minotauro tastes basically like a chai latte (one of my absolute favorite drinks) and it goes down smoother than any other cocktail I\\'ve ever had! The best part is that it\\'s quite high in alcohol content too as I had a nice buzz going on from one drink. If you\\'re headed to Blueprint and you\\'re a chai latte lover, you know what to try! \\n\\nUltimately my experience here was positive. I\\'m a bit of a walk away otherwise I\\'d absolutely be a regular. Pretty jealous of those who live in the vicinity!', u'Food. Amazing. \\nSo focused and on point. \\nThe issue was the service. \\nOrdered drinks and app.\\nFinished round of drinks. \\nAppetizer (cheese and bread) was still missing.\\nAsked again. \\nApp arrived 4 minutes before entree. \\n\"It takes a long time\" as she set it down. \\nOh? It is cheese and bread. Honestly, Just tell me, oops-I forgot. Water under the bridge. I get it. \\nHowever- \\nThe food was so good- I think I will give it one more chance.', u'A really great place for a drink and some food.  Came here twice now.  The first time was solely for drinks which were delicious.  We tried one each and were pleasantly surprised by them.\\n\\nThe second time, we came for food and drinks.  This time we got the chicken liver mousse and the cheese/meat board.  Both were delicious!  There was a good amount of food on both that we were both satiated at the end.  The drinks we ordered this time was different than the last time and they were still good.  Great place for a chill night out.', u\"Honestly, this place is so badass. Fantastic food, great atmosphere and great employees. Had a blast here and my belly's quite happy right now.\\n\\nThe rabbit pot pie is to die for.\", u\"This place was absolutely awesome. My cousin was staying in Park Slope for work and after a long back and forth about who would come to who (I live in Manhattan) I relented and agreed to go to her hood. I found Blueprint through Yelp and it looked promising and it definitely delivered. \\n\\nWe were able to be seated immediately and a waitress came over and gave us cocktail and food menus. If I had one complaint about my experience, it would be that the service was a little odd - it was unclear at first whether there was table service or not, and the server (granted, she was alone) wasn't very communicative. It definitely took a while for her to come take our order, although once she did everything came out relatively quickly. \\n\\nWe both ordered cocktails - mine (My Dear Julius - $12) had bourbon, Damson plum gin liqueur, lemon, cinnamon, maple, whiskey barrel aged bitters, orange bitters, and egg white. My cousin's (The Doctor Is In - $12) had Dorothy Parker Gin, Rhum J.M., absinthe, maraschino liqueur, lemon, and house-made grenadine. I preferred mine, although both were absolutely delicious and wonderfully crafted. I find that it's really hard to do egg-white drinks well, but mine was perfect. Both were also beautiful, which I always appreciate. Clearly a well-trained bar staff.  \\n\\nWe also ordered dessert - there were only three choices, but all of them sounded good. We decided on the cherry bread pudding because it sounded interesting ($8) and it was honestly one of the best things I've ever had before in my life. It was truly incredible and absolutely melt-in-your-mouth. We also got the pickles (weird combo, I know) which were $5 and slightly overpriced but were house-made. My cousin thought they were too spicy although she was just being a little byotch - they were great.\\n\\nOverall, everything was incredibly well-done, and although I can't imagine myself rushing back to Park Slope (sorry, BK), if I ever found myself in or near that area I would definitely come back again.\\n\\nCool patio, free WiFi, clean bathrooms. Takes cards.\", u\"I've been writing this review for months... lol. I kept bypassing it but last night I stopped in for a drink and dessert and just had to share why I like this spot. \\n\\nSetting: after 7pm the mood to me says date night. The lighting is dim and the tables are set for intimate conversation or you can sit at the bar and flirt with the bartenders...lol.\\n\\nDrinks: the drinking the night was called the Doctor is in...if you like a gin cocktail w/ a lil rum and a pretty flower this is the drink for you! My companion had wine, and enjoyed their pinot grigio.\\n\\nDessert: the bread pudding...OMG! It's my favorite dessert and I like to try it at any new spot I go to. I'm floored there's a spot this close to me with bread pudding that's so good. \\n\\nFinal thoughts: I'll be there tomorrow\", u\"Fantastic bar and some of the best cocktails I've ever had. I can especially recommend their Pimms cup. Aside from the drinks, I love the atmosphere here. Not only does Blueprint have a warm look to it with soft glowing lighting and dark woods, but the playlists are often great and the service is very kind and courteous. \\n\\nI try to come here every time I'm in Brooklyn!\", u\"I love this place! It's great for a date and it's romantic. It has outdoor seating and a sleek wood inside. I appreciate their collection of cocktails and samples multiple. \\n\\nIt's very busy and loud over the weekend but it's still worth a visit if you can squeeze at bar.\\n\\nI keep forgetting they have food so I can't comment on that.\", u\"This bar is perfect for catching up with a friend on a week night. Its not overly crowded or noisy (when I have been, people are sitting and not standing). The small plates are great for sharing, and though I can't speak to the full bar menu, the gin and tonics are always on point.\", u\"Best cocktails ever! Fantastic server! She was very patient with all our questions and didn't rush us. The house cured fish (smoked salmon board) was delicious. \\n\\nCocktails were amazing! Honestly some of the best I've ever had, especially my dear Julius and the Minotauro (spiced chai infused). Very complex and full rounded flavors. \\n\\nFantastic outdoor patio for summer dinning. We are definitely coming back! \\n\\nHappy hour Monday-Friday 4-7pm\", u'I never expected that it be amazing and love it.Great little bar, with a small but delicious cocktail selection. Fresh ideas which work great and a very tasty food selection. Relaxed place, cozy, and authentic drinks. Highly recommended to everyone!', u'Blueprint has happy hour, great cocktails, an intimate inside and a cute outside patio, so in my eyes there was pretty much nothing I would change here! I went on a weekday night with 2 friends and we were able to grab a seat on the patio as there were a decent amount of open tables. Our server was super personable and cheery which added to the overall atmosphere. We pondered over the happy hour menu, on which we decided on a hummus plate, a meat and cheese plate (not on hh menu) and I tried the Parks and Leisure cocktail to kick off our night out.\\n Parks and leisure was a bright pink, made for summer drink! Sweet and fruity served over finely chipped ice- very refreshing! Our second round took a bit of time to come out, and our server brought us some comp Daiquiri shots as a \"thanks for waiting!\" This daiquiri shot was honestly better than the drink I ordered it was so good!\\nFoodwise we went with staples so not too much to say here except we happily ate everything..! The hummus plate was a good portion for being on the HH menu, served with pita and assorted olives- and the House meat/cheese plate offered 3 options of each served with a small kale salad and a sliced baguette of bread. There was nothing left so I guess you could say we liked it :)', u\"This place is super cute! The Lighting and ambiance was perfect, cocktails were consistent and delicious! Had the prosciutto which was so thinly sliced that it basically melted in your mouth, the pork sliders and cherry bread pudding which all were really good. If you like a spicy drink get the Smoky Mary's!\", u'Yum! Great date spot.\\n\\nLoved the pinot gris, baby octopus, tomato and cress pizza, and the bruschetta. \\n\\nWould definitely come back, with or without my date.', u\"Solid cocktails, beautifully presented. The chicken liver mousse is to die for -- seriously, please don't change it one bit. So many restaurants screw it up and yours is perfection! The atmosphere in the front and in the backyard is charming ---great place for a date.  The only things I would suggest to improve are more 'seasonal' specials since sometimes the menu feels like it doesn't change enough. There are some bad booths by the bathroom -- to be honest, if that is all that is left, I leave & go somewhere else. This area could be improved with better design -- for example raising the booths up on a platform (so you step up into them) and give them higher backs and sides to make it seem like a special, separate space from the bathrooms...or somehow curtain them off!\", u'We had a drink on special -- watermelon, tequila, jalape\\xf1o -- that was tasty but not ultimately that special. We also ordered pizza that was not super exciting.', u'Overall - good experience. Drinks were tasty. Service excellent. Atmosphere really good - especially the garden.\\nThe food was good, but had both highs and lows.\\n\\nThey definitely can do great cocktails. I had a bourbon drink with egg white (my dear julius) and it was top notch - strong, complex. So 5 stars on mixology front\\n\\nThe food was a mixed bag. Some small plates were very good - boquerones (anchovies), chicken liver moose, and oyster mushroom salad - all great. On the other hand pork butt sliders were not good. Sliders came on weird cornbread like bun that just did not work, and meat itself was overly spicy - and along with spicy pickles the flavors were off... just spicy on spicy. Hence 4 stars.\\n\\nStill for a great drink and a nice small tapa\\\\snack - great place to hang', u'I had 2 delish cocktails and shared their boquerones appetizer. Spot on. The menu, decor, staff and appeal were in sync and stylish. Definitely memorable and a place to return to try many more items.', u'You might walk pass this place a few times before discovering a very quaint cocktail bar. I have. I frequent other restaurants on the same block and have never realized this great place. My friends were visiting from out of town and found this place randomly. We arrived on a Sunday afternoon for a few bites. We ordered the burrata bruschetta, baby octopus, house cured fish plate. It was all so good. We were so happy to try it all. The burrata bruschetta is almost like a grill cheese bruschetta but better. The baby octopus is deliciously seasoned and paired with potatoes, and the house cured fish plate was great for sharing. I mean we shared these 3 plates amongst 4. (we had other dinner plans) But I could totally see myself stopping here for a night out!', u\"Wanted to try a new place for a drink and some apps in the neighborhood and this place stole my heart. It's perfect for a romantic date night or catching up with your girlfriends. The menu has something for everyone and the happy hour list did not disappoint. The bathrooms were clean and everyone was super friendly. This might be my new fav place for a low key night!\"], u'84.Smoking Monkey': [u\"Totally my neighborhood go to oyster spot! The drinks are on point. If you are lucky enough to catch the weather and backyard open; you won't be disappointed. \\n\\nCrab sliders- check(awesome)\\nLobster roll- check (awesome)\\nThe damn peanuts and pepitas I'm addicted!\", u'This inconspicuous restaurant on Greene avenue has a tranquil vibe about it. I celebrated a friends birthday in the backyard with a total of 14 people, eating decent seafood, having decent drinks, engaging in cool conversations while passing around a fidget spinner. What scream more calm than that.\\n\\nI kicked off the celebration with the spicy cocktail which is a mix of tequila, triple sec, lime and a Serrano pepper. This drink definitely excited some pain receptors in my mouth and throat but still had this refreshing taste to it. \"Spicy\" has a great taste to it but risky enough to tamper with your tastebuds if you have plans on eating there. So one spicy tequila was my limit, thank you very much.\\n\\nFor dinner I had the lobster roll, cole slaw with potato chips. The lobster roll was satisfying and the potato chips was marvelous. Light, not to much salty, with just the right crunch. I also had the lobster mac and cheese, now that was outstanding. (Only thing is they could\\'ve put a little more lobster in that mac and cheese) I would highly recommend it though.\\n\\nFor the remainder of the night I drank some ros\\xe9 cider, (2 thumbs up) enjoyed the company of cool friends and ambiance that is Smokey Monkey.', u\"It's a really good attempt at an okay restaurant.\\nThe wait staff was rude and seemed to hurry us from our table from the moment we were seated. \\nThe menu focused on seafood and on burgers...which is fine, but there was little else that was interesting. \\nI wish they were awesome and unique...but they are not. Having a solid, reliable, friendly neighborhood restaurant in this part of Clinton hill/ Bed Stuy would be ideal - for the owners and the clientele.....but this place sadly has no charm, no style, no comfort, and no vibe. It is one in a number of forgettable brooklyn restaurants that we all have higher hopes for.\", u\"This is an adorable spot with really yummy food. We came here for brunch and had the croque madam and bloody marys. The food and drinks were really delicious. The service was a bit abrupt & lackluster. The waiter rushed us out to the point of grabbing my plate before I had even finished eating. There were only three other tables and it was totally empty inside so not sure why. The chairs outside are hella uncomfortable so I ended up switching to a bench next to my date. Other than that i'd still keep this on my top 10 brunch spots in the area on food alone.\", u\"If ever there was a spot was begging to be described as 'chill.' it's this one.  From the instant I walked in, I liked the relaxed energy.  And a tranquility-inducing backyard patio added to the vibe.  Even the crowd, a seeming mix of locals and randoms, like hubby and me, was mellow.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if it also included a few rejects from nearby Meckelburg's.  And there was a table of guys that looked like they were straight out of a Fung Bros video, if you're familiar.  But anyway, onto the food:\\n\\nOysters:  I happen to love 'em, but most people don't.  At least the ones I know.  And the thing is, for some reason these briny, slippery morsels always seem to taste best shared with someone who is equally enamored.  Hubby is usually in the hate 'em camp, but on this particular evening, perhaps sucked in by the $1.25 a piece Happy Hour, he agreed to try Oysters again.  Thankfully, they arrived fresh, plump, and properly shucked, aka sans grit and bits of shell.  But hubby still wasn't sold.  Maybe it was the meh seemingly housemade cocktail sauce or the overly acidic mignonette.  I would've been happier with bottled cocktail sauce and a bit of jarred horseradish over these two options.  \\n\\nOxtail Sliders: These were thisclose to being a total winner.  The meat was tender and full of flavor, but for some reason, the kitchen neglected to apply that same TLC to its accompanying mini brioche buns.  They tasted like they were taken directly from the package and plopped onto the plate, and they were a bit stale at that.  Toasting and buttering them would have gone a long way imo.\\n\\nShrimp & Chorizo a la Plancha:  This was another dish with lots of potential.  The Chorizo was lipsmackingly good, but the Shrimp were overcooked.:(  \\n\\nCrab Cakes over Arugula Salad: This was an off-the-menu hybrid dish that we requested, combining two listed items.  The Crabcakes were well-seasoned and again, full of potential,  but they were mushy, with no crispy exterior whatsoever.  Boo.\\n\\nService was as laid back as the ambiance.  Unfortunately, this translated into some major lags as we waited for each small plate to arrive.  \\n\\nBecause I liked the atmosphere of this place so much, my overall experience was more like a 3.5, but am choosing to round-down because the food wasn't four-star for me.  \\n\\nWord to the Wise: Intrigued about the reason behind the name of this place, I looked up 'Smoking Monkey,' on Urban Dictionary.  Do not make that same um... regretful mistake.\", u'This is a cute bar, they have an oyster happy hour, I think it\\'s ~$1.50 an oyster, and it goes until 7 pm. The ambience is dark but nice. They do have a backyard that looks like a fun place to hang out. Only weird thing is that I asked for the wifi password and got a \"we don\\'t share our wifi\" response.', u'Love the vibes in this place! The waiters are so kind and the seafood is fresh and delicious. The prices are so reasonable for the quality of food and you must get the lobster Mac and cheese. So delicious!!!! The drinks are also really great (pink panther try it now) has all the right marks. This is a great local place in the area for delicious small bites. Will be back again and again!', u\"Came to this place with my boyfriend because he loved the people at the former Mary's of South slope. We came for the Oscars party and had a great time. The people are very nice. They offer great suggestions such as the Mac n cheese, the candied bacon and the burger. My boyfriend rarely likes to eat bacon because of the fatty content, but he basically ate my order. They also make great drinks! Can't wait to come back for happy hour. \\n\\nThe decor is also very lovely. I liked the vintage clock as well as the lighting all around. This place is getting popular very quickly! And the food is reasonably priced, as well!\", u'Came here this past weekend.  The lobster mac and cheese and shrimp and chorizo a la plancha were inedible.  Both tasted like they were attempting to mask the taste of old seafood with sauce.  Sent both dishes back.  Oysters were very small -- not worth $2.50 a pop.  Cheese and charcuterie board had a multicolored pate on the plate.  On the plus side, the Riesling was good.  Spent $70 and left hungry.  Would not recommend unless you are exclusively coming here to drink.', u'cute atmosphere great waiter and apparently their kitchen is open hella late because we arrived around 11 and had dinner. \\nFood: the lobster mac is just alright while the oxtail slider was everything and more. I also tried the watermelon beer which was nice and refreshing. overall good experience. Wait did I mention the SUPER FRESH CLAMS?!', u\"Very quaint place with good food. Had the clams, oysters, and the burger. Loved all of it! The oyster happy hour is nice. The burger was cooked very well and the mushrooms were a great touch. The chips are chips and are solid. \\n\\nTook one star off just because $14 for a burger is just a little too much. $12 or honestly $13 would be a better price. \\n\\nWish I could give a 4.5. If I'm ever in the area I would go back for a good dinner!\", u'Really fun local hangout. Great drinks and if you like oysters, the place has your name on the door! Give it a try.', u\"My #1 problem with the bar scene in Bed-Stuy and Clinton Hill: there are not nearly enough bars for the number of bar people that live here. So the good bars are packed to the gills even on Tuesdays.\\n\\nMy #2 problem with the bar scene in Bed-Stuy and Clinton Hill: very few places have TVs with a sports game on. This means it's kinda awkward to get dinner by yourself at the bar, without an 'excuse' like baseball to watch.\\n\\nSmoking Monkey seems to have answered both these problems for me last night. Mekelburg's nearby was overflowing with trivia night, and me and my bud just wanted to have a mellow beer and some food. It was easy to find a couple seats at the bar. And the beer menu was good: a few interesting drafts and inexpensive Lion's Head for cheapskates like me. And the food is very reasonably priced, with lots of hearty 'small plates' for under $10. I think they are going for a French vibe (mussels in white wine, chicken liver pat\\xe9, oh and the bartender and chef were talking to each other in French a lot). But, somehow, they managed to have a TV with basketball on in a casual way, not detracting from the romantic setting otherwise.\\n\\nI'll come back for sure! Good date spot. Only problem may have been that it was slightly too quiet, but I'm sure that will change as people try this place out. Do it!\", u'Perfect if you are trying to make a good impression on a date. This place was Awesome loved the food with the exception of the crab cake slider I have had better, but like the concept of having it as a sandwich. We bought 2 Lobsters which were  $28 a piece 1/4lb well worth it! Was served chilled and  was fresh served with a house made Mayo. Oysters were good and served with 2 sauces. Drinks were good as well. It was like at you call service after your initial order but with the rais of the hand Someone was assisting me. This experience was worth every penny.', u\"Great place! The food was good, especially the oxtail sliders and the mac and cheese. Burgers were Ok - I'm looking forward to trying the seafood at another time. \\nMusic and atmosphere were awesome, overall a great experience.\", u\"I came here on a Monday night to try out this new restaurant. They have a lot of small plates and some big plates. This place has an outdoor seating which is good for people who wants to enjoy the nice weather. At the outdoor area, there is a mini water fountain which was pretty cute but it's kind of in the middle. This place seem like a good place for a date night or just a night out with friends for dinner. It wasn't pack at all. Hopefully it won't be super pack as more people check this joint out. As for foods, I tried the beef tongue slider which the bun was too thick that soak up the flavor. It definitely tasted better without the bun. Also got the small seafood platter which was fresh. I also got this other dish with cooked shrimps. I didn't find anything super special about that dish. The shrimp tasted a bit over cook. As for the cocktail menu, I got the pink panther. It wasn't as fruity as I hope but it's still refreshing. Overall, I'll come back here for their oyster HH.\", u\"I can't tell the different between Smoking Monkey and the bar that used to be at this location, Copper Cliffs. Appears to be the same food, definitely the same exact decor. Still enjoyed myself in the backyard yesterday. Pretty good lobster Mac n cheese and my boyfriends chipotle burger satisfied him, but he hates when the bread gets soggy and it came out that way - dear restaurant owners, serve the bun on the side and toast it dang it!\", u'Beautiful, quiet, shaded patio for brunch Prices are incredibly Reasonable and portions are sizeable. 2 people for brunch with coffee and their \"sunshine juice\" was $45ish. We will definitely be back for happy hour.', u\"I think it's the best place around !!  \\nAmazing atmosphere, very high level of food. \\nThe oysters are top grade , sea food soup is too die for !  Great cocktails !! \\nI can go on and on .. a must for Clinton hill / bedstuy ppl ! Better then lots of places in the city and Williamsburg.\", u\"My favorite place for oysters and beer. \\nOysters during happy hour are really good and inexpensive. \\nThey are so good that I simply can't stop ordering. \\nExcellent beer and hamburgers as well. \\nNice inside and great outdoor patio as well.\"], u'139.Pig Beach': [u\"Awesome indoor-outdoor spot.  There are TVs inside and outside so you can watch any games that are on.  There's a bar inside and outside.  The inside is set up like picnic tables. This place is huge, plenty of space.  You are allowed to bring your dog, too. \\n\\nThey redid the place recently, expanded the space... such a great move. \\n\\nYou order up at the counter, they give you a card with a number on it, then quickly call back your number.  Quick turn around time. \\n\\nWe got the ribs, purple coleslaw, Mac n cheese, and the hatch vinegar wings. Everything was great. If you want good BBQ, come here. \\n\\nSuch a relaxed, fun hangout spot. Good mix of friends hanging out along with families.\", u\"This place makes me sad that my extended family keeps kosher, not because of the food, but because this place would just make a beautiful venue for all kinds of events -- outdoor seating, a huge fully stocked bar, frozen drinks, clean bathrooms, a dance floor. But even if getting outside food was an option, this place is still called Pig Beach and I don't think my family would show up.\\n\\nThat being said, our meal was good. The options were limited to the tri tip and pork shoulder. We tried both, as I obviously do not keep kosher. The pork shoulder was excellent and a great place to try their four different barbecue sauces. The tri tip was disappointing, though. Can definitely miss it next time we go. And! They have little buckeyes prepared, they were very tasty.\", u\"SO. MUCH. FUN.\\n\\nNow don't get me wrong, I said Hometown BBQ was my favorite restaurant, and a big part of me still harbors that feeling (I would give a slight advantage in food to Hometown BBQ, but Pig Beach definitely has more variety), but where Hometown BBQ, brings a country vibe to BK, Pig Beach is purely Brooklyn.\\n\\nA big part of that is probably due to the outdoor area (where you can bring dogs! EXTRA STARS!), and on a perfect day with everyone having fun and hanging out and playing games, it's a great atmosphere. The tab system is convenient - the bar and the food systems are connected, so if you've started a tab at the bar, you can just have the food counter put it on your tab.\\n\\nIf you like your drinks strong, they make them strong here. I personally am not a big alcohol person, so I had to go to another bartender to sweeten the drink up a bit. And everyone who works here are just really lovely people.\\n\\nAlso, the space is huge. Huuuuuuuge. Indoor and outdoor. And if you want to have an awesome party/wedding reception at a BBQ place, they have a whole separate space for that too! \\n\\nHighly, highly recommend to any and all!\", u\"Let's secure this Pig Beachead!\\n\\nI'm going to a 4pm Yankee game and we need to eat so they'll be no need to buy a $15 hot dog during the 7th inning. I see my my Yelp buds have hit up PB with 5 stars so it must be the real deal.\\n\\nMy son & I walk into a pretty empty joint. Pig Beach is an outdoor funfest with a bar to one side of the courtyard, the other side is where you order and pick up your food. In the middle is where the fun happens at this cement beach. Cooked meats and beer, this isn't too different how I grew up. Picture twenty Italian guys in tank tops drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon and homemade wine cooking sausages, now replace them with hipsters wearing Ray-Bans. Its still a Brooklyn thing.\\n\\nWe came for BBQ. Some history on Pig Beach crew. This isn't a few Brooklyn yahoos saying we need to cook! The team is comprised of some of the best restaurants in NYC. The partners originally formulated the idea for Pig Beach when they met working on America's highly competitive barbeque teams. \\n\\nThe final product I can taste in the pork shoulder sandwich. Topped with their famous vinegar purple slaw made this one of the best BBQ sammys I had in 2017. My son ordered the yankee (Lets go Yankees!) red hot sausage which is stuffed with provolone and hot cherry peppers. \\n\\nAs for Alcohol? The $10 beer and tequila shot has this Italian Yankee asking for more. \\n\\nPig Beach is a cool spot to sip some suds and eat some good cue in the heart of Brooklyn. \\nBrooklyn baby!\", u'The image of a beach filled with swine might not sound so aesthetically pleasing, but perhaps it would be better if it just meant BBQ in Brooklyn. That\\'s the case when we\\'re talkin\\' about Pig Beach.\\n\\nBack in those hotter months, a few buddies and I were in BKLYN and needed to eat (especially after plenty of beer). I did a quick Yelp search before we left and landed on this not-so-sandy spot. Yeah Pig Beach might have that name, but it isn\\'t by any real body of water (I knew this, but thought I\\'d clarify). Instead, we walked into a truly hoppin\\' \\'que spot.\\n\\nLots of outdoor tables (mostly picnic style) and some standing room if you can\\'t grab a seat (which happened to us). There\\'s an indoor area as well, though a private event was taking place. Oh and I can\\'t forget the bustling bar. On a non-brewery day I probably would\\'ve partook in a brew, but I stuck with agua.\\n\\nSo let\\'s get to the most important part: food! I saw a video after our visit about PB being considered a \"Yankee BBQ\" spot due to these guys having no real BBQ roots. Well they could\\'ve fooled me! A deliciously tender pulled pork sandwich along with some house made pickles began the meal. They were fresh with just a little vinegar nip. I followed that up with the Yankee red hot sausage which is stuffed with provolone and hot cherry peppers. The quality and originality could be tasted in each bite. \\n\\nI loved these items, though the best might\\'ve come via sauce. Uniquely tasty is a good way to describe these sauces, especially the Alabama white (my fav). Good BBQ needs good sauce and Pig Beach has got this covered (and then some). Also gotta mention the buckeyes my chums got because I had one and they encompassed that peanut butter Ohio treat perfectly. By the end I was wishin\\' I could always sit and chill at Pig Beach, but there was more beer to drink (and if I stuffed anything else in me I might\\'ve ended up on the menu).\\n\\nOverall, Pig Beach may not have any real coastline, but who cares?! Their food is the real BBQ deal. Summer months make this a place that can\\'t be beat and one I\\'ll totally return to if I\\'m lookin\\' for quality barbecue grub. Come join me in this Yankee pig land.', u\"I've been here twice so far and for me I think the food and drinks are good  (not great) but it is a little pricy for not being super amazing.\\n\\nFood:\\n\\nThey have a variety of sauces and bread available to eat with the meats too.\\n\\nI've had the ribs, the meat falls off the bones.\\n\\nPulled pork is good too, I had it as a sampler not as the sandwich.  My friend ordered the sandwich and it was on the small side. \\n\\nThe tri tip tasted okay but it was so fatty that I wouldn't order it again.\\n\\nSides... my biggest issue with this place is the lack of sides.  They don't have corn or mashed potatoes,  no baked beans, corn bread... if be happy with at least one of those options.\\n\\nDessert is sad too.  A house made chocolate cake and ice cream would make a nice end to a meal.\\n\\nThey had 2 frozen drink flavors.  I had the froze and it tasted good there.\\n\\nAtmosphere:\\n\\nThe outdoor seating with great weather is fantastic.   They have corn hole around for people to use.  Picnic tables, bar seating.  It can get a little loud but it's a good time.\", u\"Well, the secret is out for this amazing spot in Gowanus. It's really a great space to truly hang all day with friends and it's even kid friendly, a very fun and yet chill atmosphere. Drinks are good, food is even better. Brisket, off the hook. Cheeseburger, I'm salivating just thinking of it. \\n\\nGood spot for large parties and day drinking too. Come about 30-40 minutes earlier than you thought you would need to to avoid any unnecessary lines.\", u\"Absolutely adored this place. My friend and I drove 2 hours just to eat here and it was absolutely worth it. \\nFirst of all, this place is HUGE! Second of all, the service was really fast. Third of all, the food was heavenly. \\nI had a side of Mac n cheese which was delicious. Possibly the best Mac n cheese I've had in a really long time. Highly recommend. I also had the pig beach burger. Wow! I could eat three more. \\nThe only downfall would be that it's a little pricey. My burger was $8 and my side of Mac n cheese was $6 but the portions were ridiculously small. Still worth it though.\", u\"This place is right up my alley , and it seems like everyone else's alleyway well . This place is jammed packed & rightfully so because it should be.  It's amazing!\\n\\nPig Beach is like Southern BBQ meets The Hamptons meets Brooklyn. \\n\\nUpon walking up to this down to earth, outdoor eatery we are greeted by a friendly security guard (aka Bouncer) and the music is blasting and all I see is some huge grills & smokers in the corner and everyone just laughing and enjoying while sipping their Brooklyn Lager. I turned to my wife & said are we still in Brooklyn?!?! Feel like I'm at Summers or Neptunes. \\n\\nThe food is something you order at the counter.  Everyone was very friendly & professional.  The woman at the counter that took my order even Up sold me on my burger toppings. Good call on the pulled pork on the burger. Thank you. Then to order drinks is a different line. Another pleasant experience. \\n\\nLoving the whole outdoor vibe and everyone is just chillin'. They even have Pig Beach corn hole boards. How great is that?! \\n\\nThe food is ready for pick up pretty quickly because with this amount of customers they better be on top of their game - and they are!\\n\\nEverything is juicy, tender, delicious!!!  Wings, Yankee stuffed sausage, ribs,turkey, everything was awesome-sauce! Oh that burger though...\\n\\nLove the vide, love the outdoor atmosphere , love the food , love this place...I think I'm in love.  \\n\\nThe only bad thing- seating is pretty scarce.\", u\"I can see why Pig Beach gets mobbed on weekends.  The huge concrete yard, filled with picnic tables and endless racks of ribs, 2 large bars, almost transport you out of the city.  I finally had a chance to stop in and experience it all for myself.\\n\\nBF and split a half rack of ribs and pulled pork sandwich and coleslaw.  The ribs were smothered in a tangy but sweet glaze, not exactly falling off the bone (the larger pieces were a bit tough). I get that this isn't South Carolina (Go, Ron's Home Team bbq in Charleston!), the but I've definitely had better in NYC.  Pulled pork sandwich was soggy and nothing transcendent.   \\n\\nThe weird thing was, during our meal, there was a little curly haired dog that the annoying group next to us kept putting on the table  (they were finished with their meal and drinking cocktails at this point). It was disgusting, and didn't really help my impression of this place.  Where are the managers?  I get that dogs get to come into an open air restaurant but they do NOT belong on the tables.  \\n\\nWhile the food was not bad, I've definitely had better, and generally, I'm looking for more sides to round out the meal than just pickles and prepackaged coleslaw.   Glad I got to see what the fuss was about, but I'm not sure I'll be returning.\", u\"Definitely a meat market, no pun intended. The food was amazing!! The space was larger than expected, but very young crowd, lots of drunk people and very loud. The beer selection could use some help, but we weren't here for the beer. The ribs fell off the bone, some of the best wings I've ever had, the variety of sauces was great and the Mac & Cheese was delicious. \\nDog friendly, family friendly (in the private event area) and plenty of space to move around. \\nThe restrooms are gender neutral and multiple bars preventing build up. \\nWould definitely eat here again, EVERYTHING looked soooo good!\", u\"Grab a bunch of friends and head to Pig Beach asap because this place is awesome. The vibe is chill and casual with plenty of picnic tables, live music playing in the background, and a limited but delicious menu and frozen cocktails too.\\n\\nDefinitely order the ribs, tender but still wonderfully satisfying to chew. Get some sausage, which is stuffed with cheese - do you need anymore convincing? The pulled pork was really good as well, and my vehicle of choice for trying all the sauces (XXX was a moderately spicy sweet chili sauce, and I loved the mustardy one!). The tri tip was surprisingly good and really uncommon for a BBQ place, a good option to try if you have room. I'm all about the BBQ sides, and I'd recommend at least getting the pickles and the deviled eggs (a mixture similar to macaroni salad with noodles).\\n\\nWings were a bit dry, but the sauce on them was great - a spicyish sauce with a drizzle of white sauce (but no it doesn't really taste like chicken over rice). We ordered the burger with pulled pork, but just get the pulled pork on its own because the burger itself was good but not amazing. \\n\\nThe frose was ok but tasted more like pink lemonade, the frozen rum drink was good but strong!Service is a little confusing, but there are actually people to help clear plates. \\n\\nTLDR: Basically this is a perfect backyard BBQ that you wish you could throw (but you really don't want to deal with cooking and cleanup). Bonus points for being spotlessly clean, allowing dogs, and having clean indoor bathrooms. Get there earlyish around 6:30pm to grab a table, because like everyone else you're going to end up hanging out for hours.\", u'This place is SOOO good, you must go NOW! Food is consistently delicious and the backyard bbq atmosphere is perfect! The burgers and ribs are a must. Also try the house made sauces. Place is always packed but line goes quick and theres always a seat.', u\"Very cool bar.  Great for summer and big groups. It is a little out of the way, but I kinda like it better like that. \\n\\nThey have a full bar, with a bunch of mixed drinks for only $11/12 and they're strong! The food is amazing, a bunch of different types of BBQ and it is TASTY. I just wish they had nachos or French fries or something that you can munch on. I'm not really one to eat two burgers and a hotdog just to fill up.\", u\"I came here on a Monday evening.  The place was pretty packed and the space is huge.  The space is nice to hang out with friends on a nice day.  There's many picnic tables inside and outdoors.  I ordered a Brooklyn Summer Ale at the bar and my friends grabbed a table.  The bar wasn't that busy but took a while to get drinks.  My friend ordered half a rack of ribs at the food counter which was on the other side.  I tried a small rib - the sauce was way too sweet.  I tried their other sauces - red, alabama white, malt vinegar, and xxx.  The xxx and the malt vinegar seemed to taste better than the sauce the ribs were covered in.  I feel like I could go down the street to Dinosaur and get better ribs.  The one thing that's better here is the space.  The food and service at the bar could be better.\", u\"Pig beach is a good place to go!! Lots of people and the best thing is that it's outdoors! So you can enjoy the weather! Great place to go in the summer. Good to go with a group of friends! Prices are very reasonable. Music was good!\\nThe food is terrific!! Had the rack of ribs and it's was amazing!! The burger was good! And the drinks were very well mixed!! Great place to get food and a beer in the summer!!!\", u'Great place!\\nOnly outdoors (just for summer?) and is very large with numerous picnic tables and two outdoor bars.\\nThe first bar, when you enter, is limited but the one after entering has everything!  :)\\n\\nThe food is a bit overpriced, I think.\\nI had the tri tips (which is basically sliced steak) and was prepared medium rare.  It was pretty good.  The cost was $15.\\nI also had the vinegar cole slaw which was $6 and not a great sized-portion.\\n\\nI would have liked it more if there was more of a food selection and possibly some corn bread!', u\"Just disappointed by the counter service or the lack of there being service inside. We arrived on a bustling Saturday evening. So excited to see so many people and dogs everywhere. We were soooo hungry and went straight to the counter and realized it was closed. Then we were directed to the outside ordering pit. We put in our order and then were told they didn't have any sides and the inside counter would open in an hour for any side orders. So at this point we were so hungry we ordered our food anyway I opted for the tri tip hubby had the pork and my sister had a single burger. I would have appreciated maybe throwing in some coleslaw for the inconvenience but that didn't happen. I looked for a table while my husband waited for our order. Inside the music is wayyyy too loud. Like people are loud to begin with in groups. Now add alcohol and louder music and it you can barely think in there. We left a little hungry after sharing that and ended up at another more satisfying  and further away BBQ joint (not dinosaur bbq).  What we had was tasty. But I felt like service is passed over since they are so busy and can afford to lose a few dissatisfied customers.\", u\"I really like the space. It's larger than I thought. They were renovating the indoor space when I went and given that it was supposed to rain, we sat at picnic table under building canopy. We ordered the food and they gave us a ticket and called our number when it was ready. I was disappointed they didn't have brisket. I was told it was only sold in the city pig beach location. My friend and I ordered ribs, double burger, pulled pork sandwich, pickles and cole slaw. The burger and pulled pork sandwich were delish. The ribs meat was tender and easily came off the bone. The cole slaw was so delish had pineapple in it. There's a bar and made it an awesome spot to meet with friends and hang for awhile. Saw a few ppl here with kids. As the night progressed it was mostly an adult crowd.\", u\"Pig Beach catered my company anniversary party on 9/26 for about 60 team members at Five Boroughs Brewery! The BBQ and beer paired very well together, I highly recommend both venues.\\n\\nFor the final menu, I ordered Mac & Cheese, ribs, and hatch vinegar wings. They included the Alabama White sauce and Rob's Righteous Red sauce! My team enjoyed their food and their food paired very well with beer from Five Boroughs Brewery!\\n\\nI worked with Bridget on this order and she helped create my menu, worked with my budget and dietary restrictions. I highly recommend ordering from Pig Beach for any crowd. \\n\\nThank you from UncommonGoods!\\n\\nAnita\"], u'62.Talde': [u\"Love this place! They could do more with the decor but the service was excellent and the food outstanding. The waiter recommended the crab fried rice and that's something I will get every time I come here. It's supremely delicious. We also had the beef with noodles, it was tasty and well prepared but a little forgettable. I did like the drink he recommended as well, it was the ginger rose and it was dry and tasty. The bartender definitely knows what he's doing\\n\\nThey have a brunch service as well so I'll be going for that.\", u\"My husband and I came for dinner tonight. We made reservations just in case, even though it was a weekday. Good thing we did because the restaurant got crowded. \\n\\nWe were greeted promptly and seated by the host. We sat towards the front of the restaurant near the bar. Their menu is not extensive at all, which is nice, because I don't want to take an hour trying to pick out what I'm going to stuff my face with. We ended up ordering the Korean fried chicken, the branzino, the market vegetables, and a side of roti (since the entrees didn't come with rice - you have to order rice in the side dish section and they are pricy). When the food came, we got a huge plate of the crab fried rice, compliments of the chef!!! Super nice of them. \\n\\nThe food was pretty good. The vegetables (long beans) were a little salty but the Asian flavors were delicious. The fried chicken was boneless, crispy, and juicy. The branzino was ok... a little too much dill and cumin for me. \\n\\nThey were not joking when they said the dishes are family style. We ordered too much and took a lot of the food home in doggy bags. Can't wait to eat the leftovers!\", u'This experience was so great! \\n\\nFrom the attentiveness of the server to the food. I made reservations and was promptly seated. We ordered the following:\\nChicken wings - amazing! The flavor was to die for with the hot sauce. \\nYuzu guacamole - yum yum, the rice was perfectly cooked and the guacamole was delicious\\nKorean fried chicken- sauce was amazing and the chicken was great\\nBranzino- hands down my favorite dish here \\nCrab fried rice- my second favorite dish here, so yummy. \\nDrinks- lychee martini and whiskey smash ginger are the best \\n\\nOverall the staff, management, and all of the dishes are to die for. Also, I love that the menu is not crazy big, they know what works and stick with it. Will be coming here once a month.', u\"This is a great and a good lookin place. \\nThere were originally 7 of us but we ended up adding another person and we had to move the reservation for 15 min. The restaurant was totally cool with that. \\nThe wait staff, the host and the management were funny and super cool. \\n8 of us barely fit in the booth, thankfully we are all rather small people but it was tight. \\n\\nHere is what we tried:\\nGuacamole - both kinds, it looks like sushi, small portion, it was probably my least fave thing in comparison with other flavors there. \\nKale salad - miso dressing amazing \\nSamosa - ok, ask for hot sauce\\nBrussels - delicious! \\nSalmon tartar - delicious!\\nBranszino - LOTS of very unique flavors, it's deboned too, wrapped in a banana leaves \\nFried chicken - very crispy, tasty sauce, comes with sweet cherries \\nLemongrass pork shoulder - tasty peanut spicy sauce\\nFried rice - very pleasant, good for sharing, tasted light and not greasy \\n\\nDesert: they only have one - halo halo. It comes in a big bowl and its content gets mixed before serving into individual bowls by a waiter. It's definitely a weird concoction. It's like a milky icey crunchy sweet soup with tapioca gelatin bites, blueberries, oranges and strawberries, topped with captain crunch cereal. I still have mixed feelings about it. \\nSince there were so many of us, the manager ordered another one for us and that was very nice. \\nAll of us liked the experience, the only thing I would like to see or confirm if they use organic, wild caught and grass fed proteins. I was reluctant eating meat and fish there and was only sampling. \\nAs for the drinks, we tried large watermelon margaritas and ginger smash. Both were just ok, there is definitely room for improvement there.\", u'\"The next day, I could still smell that Kung Pao sauce on my fingers\". That\\'s the new title of my autobiography, which goes on sale next week for $495 on the Big Baller Brand website. You get a free pair of basketball shoes with it, while supplies last. \\n \\nOne of the best things about Talde is all the light you get inside from the wrap around windows. Because of this, there\\'s no real bad seat in that you never really feel trapped in a corner. Unless, you choose the chef\\'s counter. We did, because the wait for sitting outside was dumb long dong.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to know how my food is made. I don\\'t want to see how they touch everything (including scratching their nose) and then touch my food before giving it to me. I don\\'t want to know the wings are pre-cooked and then tossed in that sauce before it\\'s set in front of me. I don\\'t want to see the expediter taste the plate before sending it out. I don\\'t want to see how tired & run down all the cooks look behind the hot ass stoves, to make food for me. Who the fuck thinks this shit is a good idea? Not me, Gyna. And NEVER AGAIN, will I do this to myself. \\n\\nI\\'ll skip these on the next visit:\\n\\nKung Pao Wangs. First of all, it was cool in the middle (see above) and the sauce was the only thing that made you think this was just cooked. Sure, it\\'s somewhat flavorful, but unless, you\\'re a weirdo who eats wings with a knife and fork it\\'s messy AF to eat, so take that into consideration if you\\'re here on a date. Then again, any girl who orders this on a date with me, is wifey material. \\n\\nHouse Cocktails. We had two orders of lychee martini and whiskey smash to start. It would take 6 of these to get me smashed and I\\'m a cheap date. Ito ay basura. I\\'m not saying you need to have a lot of alcohol for me to call it a good drink, but for $13 each, I need to feel like I didn\\'t just drink sugar water. I went with the champagne of Filipino beers for the rest of the time, aka-Red Horse, which is malt liquor. It\\'s actually more like the Colt 45 of Filipino beers, minus Billy Dee. \\n\\nThis was a maybe: \\n\\nThe branzino. It looks like it would have a lot more flavor, but it was subtle and very moist. I think they wrapped it in banana leaves? I\\'m not a huge white fish fan, so this kind of fish normally isn\\'t my thing. It had intentional burnt parts to it that I enjoyed immensely. More foods should have burnt edges or sides to it when appropriate. \\n\\nI need this in my life, weekly:\\n\\nThe smoked bacon and fried oyster Pad Thai. The thick cut \"bacon bits\" has a more ham texture to it and I haven\\'t tasted anything this amazing since I had a Benton\\'s ham, aka-the Bentley of Ham. The spice was mild, but flavorful. The crispy/creamy play of the fried oysters were the perfect compliment to the salty, extreme smokey goodness of that bacon and both danced in harmony with the rest of the dish. I\\'d spread this all over my body and eat myself, if that was humanly possible. You may pause here to throw up. \\n\\nFinally, a rant from me to all you douche\\'s out there: \\n\\nAt the Chef\\'s counter, my back was turned from a table of Asians, but I could hear those dicks.   One of them was Filipino and the rest were a mix of jungle and fancy Asians. The Flip kid started talking about how he ate some kind of Filipino dish here the last time and it wasn\\'t even close to what \"real Filipino\" food taste like. Don\\'t even get me started on how he thought, Filipino food isn\\'t supposed to be \"expensive\". \\n\\nThis infuriates me to no end. I wanted so bad to kick him in the throat, but I\\'m a lady, so I refrained. This debate, which happens a lot with my people is apples and bowling balls. You don\\'t go to Sandusky, Ohio looking for NYC. Unless, you\\'re a buffoon. It\\'s wannabe, hipster, food blogging foolios (aka \"foodies\") that take food pics standing on chairs like they\\'re some kind of fucking drone, and don\\'t have a clue - like this kid, that give places like this a bad rep. \\n\\nIf you don\\'t like the food, I get that. However, to say that a dish that was created by Dale Talde, a Filipino, isn\\'t Filipino enough for you is, for lack of a better word: retarded. First of all, this place doesn\\'t claim to be like your momma\\'s or lola\\'s cooking, retarded Flip kid. It barely has any Filipino inspired dishes at all on the menu, actually. And second of all, if the intent was to modernize a traditional Filipino dish using modern technique and different ingredients it\\'s still, in it\\'s soul: Filipino. It\\'s just not traditional Filipino, you jackass. Lastly, price has nothing to do with authenticity or how good something tastes. If the cost of a dish that gave you a foodboner is the main reason you don\\'t like it, you\\'re a basic bitch. \\n\\nI feel better. And, I think for the most part, you will too after eating here.', u\"My biggest takeaway from Talde is that it's a much better place for meat eaters than vegetarians. The menu is almost entirely meat - except a few appetizers. But they can make the pad thai vegetarian or vegan and they can make the fried rice vegetarian (I even called ahead to ask about the options and the woman I spoke to was very nice and accommodating). Good enough - I'm usually pretty happy with a plate of pad thai.\\n\\nIt was very clear when we ordered that we had 1 vegetarian and 3 meat eaters - I even explicitly told the waitress I was vegetarian (and she seemed super conscious of it) - and we ordered 1 vegetarian entree and 3 meat entrees (for the meat eaters to share). For some reason, they decided to bring out all the meat dishes first one after the other so there was nothing I could eat until the very end. She did mention that they bring things out as they are ready, but a more experienced restaurant certainly wouldn't bring dishes out that way so that it was very obvious 1 person would be sitting idle, and also I find it hard to believe 3 meat dishes were done before 1 veggie pad thai. \\n\\nOnto the food itself: again, the meat dishes were much better than the vegetarian pad thai. The pad thai is not a traditional pad thai - don't exepct the slightly sweet, peanutty flavor you get from a standard thai place. It had more of an East Asian flavor (salty and soy saucy) and it was a bit slimy. Honestly I was not a fan. The meat dishes were pretty good - the fried chicken had good skin but the meat was a bit too thick, the oyster and bacon pad thai my dinner companions enjoyed because of the bacon flavor, and the standout dish was the pork shoulder which was incredibly tender and had a delicious sauce. \\n\\nSo in conclusion - come here if you eat meat (and order the pork shoulder).\", u\"I've been wanting to try Talde since I moved to Park Slope. I religiously watch Top Chef and Dale was one of my favorite contestants. Loved his style of cooking and was excited that I'd be able to try it.\\n\\n11 months later...I finally try Talde! I booked a reservation for my dad and I at 6 on a Sunday. This was one of the only options that night, and when we got there, the restaurant was packed! We didn't have to wait for a table because of our reservation, but we did notice a few people sitting at the bar.\\n\\nOur server was really great and friendly. Explained the style of service (sharing, family, etc.) at Talde. This was super helpful, as the menu looks pretty traditional. \\n\\nWe tried the pretzel dumplings which were so good - could have honestly ordered enough of those for a meal and been satisfied. Really tasty and crispy! We then shared the beef and broccoli noodle dish and the crab fried rice. Both portions were massive and we left with food left over. Both dishes were really great - salty, savory, amazing. The beef and broccoli was on the spicy side as it had Thai chilis in it. Nice heat, though.\\n\\nMy one suggestion is the music. It was a little loud in the restaurant, especially for a Sunday at 6 pm. Other than that, we had a great meal and it was definitely worth the wait!\", u'Talde\\'s brunch selections are great! Ive been here several times for brunch, but specifically came here with a group of 7 for Mother\\'s Day, and we had a great experience. \\n\\nAmong our favorites were the Pad Thai, Fried Rice, lemongrass chicken, and kale salad. All the options are tasty, but be prepared to order a fair amount of plates if you come with a larger group as all items are served family style. Among the more \"substantial\" plates are the Pad Thai and Fried Rice, in case you\\'re looking for fillers and your party came to eat. \\n\\nNote that they do not serve drip coffee - only French press pots (for $9). Ours took a little while to come out (we were already eating by the time we got coffee) but the waitress did communicate the delay and make us aware. \\n\\nOverall a good brunch experience and would definitely return.', u'Last night I went to Talde for my second time, with tempered expectations, and came away disappointed. The waiter was quite pleased with himself every time he came to our table, reciting arcane ingredients and proudly detailing the processes by which our spirits were spritzed and served, but his visits were as periodic as they were verbose and professorial. He missed orders, forgot drinks, and did nothing to make up for the over-twenty-minute wait for a health inspection to finish. The drinks were overpriced and underpoured. As for the food, I rather imagined i was eating a peacock for all the pomp and hidden meat. \\n\\nThe final dish presented was our first ordered, the Brussels sprouts, which were plated with great ceremony. The sprouts appeared to be throughly charred, all the way into the center, leaf after leaf. An impossible feat, you might think, but not worth exploring or attempting to replicate, as the sprouts, like the restaurant itself, present a great deal going on, but reveal inside little more the illusion of flavor. \\n\\n\\nOverburdened by its considerable affect and adornment, Talde has no heart and is best avoided unless you seek another expensive, unforgettable night you wish you could forget. \\n\\nThe second star is a courtesy for the departed Pork Slope.', u\"My then boyfriend now husband took me here for the first time during our early courtship, knowing I love Asian food and knowing the guy who owned it was somewhat famous. It was love at first sight the first time I tried their pretzel dumplings, kung bao chicken wings, fried rice and Korean fried chicken. It was delicious! The drinks were awesome too. Since then, we order take out and we went back to the place to dine a month ago. The food is absolutely fantastic and I love meat so it was awesome that the place is meatcentric. However, the dessert disappoints. They only had halo halo and the guy was trying to explain what it was and failing. It didn't sound right to me. Lol. I'm Filipino and have eaten halo halo a million times. I know what it is and I know what it should taste like. That wasn't it. I won't take off points for that but I wouldn't come here for dessert. 5 stars for the appetizers and entrees and 0 stars for the desserts.\", u'Nice staff but the food was cold & over sauced. The quality was not worth the price. Seemed more fast food than elevated.', u'Been here twice since I moved into the \\'hood, no third time is planned.\\n\\nFood is OK - kind of an \"International\" potluck at work where office workers of varying culinary talent attempt to reproduce something they tasted a year ago on an outing to Queens. Not inedible. Would probably have given 3.5 starts.\\n\\nBut the service... just really bad. Either gloomy and downward rude, or they don\\'t speak English - which is totally fine, but then they should just cheerfully admit it and get someone who does. Instead they assume a frightened expression and very tensely try to blow you off. This happened last time, and today as well:\\nMe: \"what beer do you have on tap?\"\\nWaiter: \"Here\" (pointing at the menu)\\nMe: \"It is a food menu, doesn\\'t list the drinks\"\\nWaiter: \" Other side\"\\nI turn the menu over to demonstrate that there is nothing there about the drinks.\\nWaiter (looking more and more frightened, as if I was asking what kinds of crack they were selling): \"I ask my manager\".\\n\\nThe manager never comes.\\n\\nNot a big deal, but I suspect that these guys don\\'t get treated well (or why would they all be so uniformly uncomfortable?). Or maybe there is another reason. Either way, the atmosphere and the interactions are fairly unpleasant, and the food is just not worth it.', u\"I think Chef Talde liked my aunt because he treated our table really nicely lol. \\n\\nFood was good. Unique experience. It's like Filipino food with a twist! Food was fresh and yummy!\", u'Awesome food, great staff, perfect experience, will definitely be back! Brunch was crazy good.', u\"Arrived at Talde 8pm dinner time, main purpose . Mission: To try out Chef Dale Talde's Korean fried chicken\\n\\nRestaurant is clean and busy with out side seating available.\\n\\nSeating options are Booths , Window side tables, Bar and Chefs bar with a direct view of the kitchen.\\n\\nRestaurant staff and service was cordial and quick.\\n\\nParking is on street only with a few bike racks near by.\\n\\nReview:\\n\\nChicken was served cold, and under seasoned both of these got corrected right away with out any issue, the crunch on the chicken was awesome, the chicken was well drained and not oily. The cook was just perfect keeping the chicken moist, however the chicken breast was cut after frying causing it to rapidly loose moisture.\\n\\nTip: Eat the cuts up parts first and chit chat later.\\n\\n\\nThings that I would alter for my next visit, and some suggestions for the chef\\n\\nKimchi Yogurt on the side instead on the plate,\\nA wedge of lemon to zest the chicken, or some kind of butter and garlic based dip would round off the flavor,.\\nChoice of meat can be added to the order I personally prefer dark vrs white chicken meat.\\nDo it cut up chicken after this robs the pleasure of biting into a steaming piece of freshly fried chicken.\\nAdding red chili pepper of black sulfurous salt to the batter would excite the flavors\\n\\n\\nAll in all a great experience, I salute Dale Talde skill of turning this simple dish a please to eat.\", u'As a San Franciscan foodie, the only thing I love more than hating things is feeling like I\\'m in on a secret. When my wife and I found ourselves in Brooklyn for a 5 day trip, we were intent on eating my way through it. I came here on the recommendation from a local, and it didn\\'t disappoint! Crab fried rice, chicken wings, delightfully strange guacamole/sushi bites, and the best fish I\\'ve had since, well, maybe, ever. We topped that off with what we lovingly called the \"stoner\\'s delight\" - an Asian shaved ice dessert with fresh fruit, smothered in condensed milk, and topped with Cap\\'n Crunch. Long story short - we\\'ll came back the next night for another one of those Whiskey Ginger Smash cocktails.', u\"Had Saturday brunch here yesterday with some friends and am still full from this meal 24 hours later. If you want a truly epic brunch and want to wow your friends, I highly recommend coming here. Even if Brooklyn is a trek for you, Talde is definitely worth it. \\n\\nOrdered basically everything on the brunch menu...breakfast ramen, bacon egg and cheese fried rice, the samosas, the wings, and got the fruit juice mimosas. Everything was absolutely TO DIE FOR. My personal favorite was the breakfast ramen, incorporates classic Asian ramen with an American French toast breakfast. But, I highly recommend just getting everything on the menu. I will be honest when I say that some of the plates were a little too salty, particularly the wings, but I didn't really care because it was all so f***ing good.\\n\\nThe service here was also fantastic and the waiters walk around with dim sum that they give you to try on top of what you've ordered. I've never seen a restaurant to that before. This place is a must if you are starving and are ready to engulf a 5 course meal in one sitting with no regrets. \\n\\nCouldn't give it a full 5 stars because I wish the menu had more of a selection. There are only a few plates to choose from, all really tasty, but I hope they add more in the future. Overall, fantastic experience and can't wait to come back.\", u\"Halo halo !\\n\\nCraZy fun dessert !!!  Fruit, coconut, Cap'n crunch!\\n\\nFew vegetarian options \\n\\nHowever, they made the Pad Thai vegetarian and it  was lovely- a lot of flavor, lightly hot - great dish.\\n\\nTwo days later:\\nGreat portions too!  I am enjoying the veggie pad thai two days later as an incredible leftover!!!\\n\\nFabulous eats!\", u\"I had Saturday brunch here with a couple of friends and it was amazing! Love the Filipino sun rising above the logo.\\n\\nWe ordered sausage egg and cheese fried rice, kung pao chicken and waffles, breakfast ramen, and pork pancakes with a fried egg on top, I forget the exact name but it was on the pink specials of the day menu sheet.\\n\\nI'm blessed to have great friends who were willing to share a bite because each bite of these four dishes would make any hungry person selfish! Lol\\n\\nSausage, egg and cheese fried rice comes in a small bowl but enough to make you full. The fried rice was a bit on the oily side but hey it's that good good Asian oil. Texture of all the ingredients were pretty good!\\n\\nKung pao chicken and waffles! Now this popular Chinese entree dish seems limited to just steam rice with green onions and you're set! BUT Talde did the unthinkable and added waffles! Man what a great decision. The Alice of the kung pao and the sweetness from the waffle and syrup were literally ying and yang! Very good!\\n\\nBreakfast ramen with bacon! Now you can pretty much add bacon to anything and it'll be an amazing dish! The broth was not your usual broth meaning, your type of lunch/dinner ramen where the broth is a bit heavy due to the amount of toppings one puts. For the breakfast ramen the broth toast was made just right and light and easily enjoyable for your hangover cure! \\n\\nNow the grand finale! Pork with pancakes and fried egg (I forget exact name) but it was on the special of the day menu. The simple idea of pancakes was brought to an unimaginable level. You normally think pancakes with egg, and bacon, which is boring!!!! Add pork and egg?!  EVERYONE NEEDS TO TRY THIS DISH! \\n\\nService was average, but it was pretty busy. When I'm in town I am going here again!!!!\", u'The food here is amazing and so unique. I eat here at least 2x a month. The staff is courteous and efficient.  I love the Yuzu guacamole and samosas but my absolute favorite are the crab rice and the cashew rice.  I could eat those everyday.  And the Brussels sprouts too.'], u'3.Golda': [u'The best breakfast in Brooklyn!!!!! \\nAll the dishes are good. \\nThe coffee amazing .\\n100 % happy , i recommend all the neighbors come and taste .', u'Golda is a sweet little cafe located in bed stuy. After seeing images of their food, I didn\\'t expect to walk into a place that looked more like a cafe. Its cozy and cool, but definitely not the most comfortable dining area. Some very small wooden tables and stools. I was there today, which is midday-midweek, so it wasn\\'t that crowded. \\n\\nThe food was delicious! I had the Honey Nut Squashes with freak croquette, skordallia (whatever that is) and black toum (what is that) with a soft scramble. I may not know what all the ingredients in this dish are, but I assume the skordallia / toum was in the sauce and t hat was divine. Break off a piece of that squash and tip it in the sauce - yum. I surprised myself by liking a vegetable dish. The croquettes was what made me order the dish, but its not the best part of it, at all. The flavors of the dish was bold, but the croquettes were not that tasty. But I dipped it in that sauce and yum. \\n\\nI also tasted the Cauliflower dish with chermoula, beet tahini, quinoa, apricot and pecorino. It wasn\\'t my dish, so I didn\\'t have much of it. The cauliflower was very tasty. Nicely roasted and great accompaniments. Had some avocado, and no matter how you slice it, despite of this avocado trend, for me, its the same if I eat it at home or I pay $6 for it. But people that order sliced avocado know to expect avocado, correct? The coffee was very good as well, which makes it ideal for a daily coffee spot for people in the \\'hood. \\n\\nThere is still quite a few things I\\'d like to try, but the one disappointment was the size of the dishes. I expected them to be a lot bigger for the price. Its very pricey for the amount you get, and its not a full \"dine-in\" experience with the limited amount and type of seating.', u\"What a welcomed addition to BedStuy! Golda is a cute little shop that we happened upon while in between morning errands -- and it was the best find! Came in for a coffee, but then ended up just dining in for the breakfast foods after seeing the menu. \\n\\nThe shop is small but with a good amount of seating. When we came in, it was a little quiet, but soon after a line formed and it was busy on out. It was bright and comfortable, with a good mix of people stopping in. \\n\\nWe had the menemen eggplant and the smoked trout sandwich. Oh boy, the dishes came out and it was beautifully presented. The menemen eggplant was so flavorful and perfect for breakfast -- perfect fried egg, tomatoey eggplants, saffron yogurt, and delicious slices of toast. The smoked trout sandwich was on a really good brioche (like, really good) with chunks of smoked trout, trout caviar, a really great scrambled egg -- and to my surprise, a pine nut relish that really added an interesting savoriness to each bite. I heard a lady also raving about the egg sandwich she ordered. We were all happily impressed! \\n\\nFor coffee, my husband got a cold brew and I had a cortado. Coffee is on the mild side, but good. And it's right off the Franklin C stop, so what a great location. \\n\\nService was awesome too--can't wait to come back!\", u\"In the shadow of the shuttle, the Franklin Ave shuttle is a special bakery with Middle Eastern/ Eastern European shades. Cozy perimeter seating with a sweet and savory menu. Highly creative small plates- I went with a savory brioche with eggplant and a salad with carrots.\\nAmazing brioche unlike anything I've ever tasted in a little Bed Stuy bakery that was worth the trip. The onion roll sandwiches looked off the charts as well.\", u\"Amazing new trendy cafe in a very ungentrified part of Bed Stuy from one of the partners from the short-lived but great Tilda All Day.\\n\\nRight near the Franklin Ave C train stop, this place sticks out among the dollar stores and fried chicken shops, but it's well worth it for amazing pastries and the menu of small plates, salads and sandwiches.\\n\\nTry any of the pastries, which are all excellent. We also tried the great Fried Chicken Sandwich, so we'll be back for more food too.\", u'Yummmmmm the egg sandwich is perfect. The flat white is excellent. The space and ceramics beautiful. I love that there is a made to order served all day as well as pastries. So happy to have this spot in the neighborhood. Although it really does get busy even on a weekday morning.', u\"Visited Golda's today for breakfast and started planning our next visit even before we finished our meals, it's that good! \\n\\nRoasted Turnip with collard greens, apples, einkorn and chillies - beautiful presented, delicious flavour. \\n\\nBaked Spinach and egg with herb toast- warming, hearty, nicely spiced. I could've eaten two of them! \\n\\nChic pea flour, raspberry, almond pastry - really enjoyed by a celiac customer, excellent! \\n\\nWe'll probably be back at least once more before we leave town.\", u\"Super lovely little place - great iced tea and coffee. And then the food. Wow. I've never had cauliflower done so well that I felt like it was an actual meal. And it was beautiful to boot. Will definitely be back to try all the other interesting dishes!\", u'This is my favorite place in the neighborhood. Sun drenched, top notch cappuccino and amazing dishes. This place is heaven!', u\"We live just a few doors down from Golda so it's very exciting to see a fun new neighborhood cafe open up. The ambiance is bright and airy, with cool decor that isn't distracting. While it's a small space, it feels comfortable and inviting. \\n\\nDanny recommended the cookie milk latte, the bacon pastry, and the smoked trout egg sandwich. The latte was a sweet, creamy iced coffee that is super addicting and the sandwich was the standout dish, freshly made with high quality ingredients. I cannot wait to continue to eat my way through the entire menu. \\n\\nWe're happy to have Golda on our block!\", u'Great food. I had the trout sandwich and it was amazing. The owner and staff are super nice.', u\"Just stopped by for lunch with a friend and WOW. Golda's menu is so beautifully curated I absolutely adore it. The interior decor is so cute and welcoming, I feel like this will definitely not be the last time I visit. Also, the barista made a mean espresso, which quite honestly, is very hard to find in Brooklyn (coming from a barista, who struggles when making espresso based drinks.) DO not even get me started on the food: Oh. my god. Best place to brunch or lunch in Bed Stuy, that's how good the food is. My friend got the Cauliflower and it was plated so beautifully and with so many colors, no to mention how good it tasted. \\n\\nAlso met the owner and he was the sweetest! He greeted my friend and I very warmly and chatted with us, making sure all our questions were answered. In short, Golda feels like home and I really appreciate the addition to the neighborhood.\", u'So glad to see Danny back in the neighborhood! Great ambience, delicious coffee, super cute decor. Just what the neighborhood needs- we plan to be regulars!', u'With friendly staff, an outside-the-box breakfast menu and superb coffee, Golda is a welcome addition to an otherwise (gastronomically) barren Bed-Stuy neighborhood.', u'This place is a necessary addition to our little piece of Franklin Ave. Went in initially just curious about what they sold, and left appropriately full from a delicious egg sandwich and s pastry. This place has a simple menu with some unique ingredients that add just the right amount of flare. Highly, highly recommend.', u\"Incredibly pleasant morning coffee experience. They took time to describe their menu, describing their pastries and ingredients in detail. The pistachio rose was incredible - not too sweet and very flavorful. You won't regret stopping by!\", u'Small place dedicated to quality of food and personal attention to customers.  I had the Turkish breakfast, which seems pricey at first blush, but it was a very generous portion of a wide assortment, kind of like a substantial graze on two plates.  Very creative and tasty.  They have been up and running for about a month.  They do all of their own baking in the basement.  I was given a custard cardamom bun gratis to finish my meal.  Owner Danny is genuinely friendly.  If they continue to deliver with the service and food, they will need more space', u\"I live in the neighborhood and was so excited to see this cafe. This review is purely for the frittata - for $17, I expected a little bit more than what I got. The dish lacked some kind of seasoning - maybe some salt would have been good - and there was no side salad, no bread, nothing else. If I'm going to pay $17 for a frittata that was mostly greens and not very filling, I'd expect a little something on the side to tide me over. I did try some of my friends bread that came with the hummus dish, and it was really good. Overall, the place is cute and has good ambience, but this dish was lacking.\", u\"Great new addition to the hood. Great food and coffee and it won't break the bank. Lunch for 2 is around $30.\"], u'46.AlMar': [u'**CASH ONLY**\\n\\nMe and my friend just got done eating a lobster roll near the water area and were walking back to our place when we stumbled upon the hole in the wall.\\n\\nWe were still hungry so we decided to stop in. When you come inside it is a rustic dark feel. They also had a old twilight show on the wall playing. Very unique!\\n\\nI started off with the italian lemondae cocktail (gin based). It was good, not too strong or sweet. ust enough to get a good buzz on. My friend had ordered the spritz. It was kind of too sweet for us since it is prosecco based. But the presentation was great!\\n\\nThey give you sourdough bread with olive oil to much on. I liked how our server even asked us if we wanted more haha.\\n\\nFor my main course I went with the tagliatelle bolognese with boar i believe. It was good. \\n\\nMy friend got a pesto pasta with shrimp. Hers was much better than mines. \\n\\nThe only reason why I am knocking off a star is because I felt like my server was not happy every time he came over to us. We got the feeling he either hated his job or he felt that we did not have money to give a good tip.', u\"We had mixed experience here. It was an unplanned visit and this was the only decent Italian restaurant that we could find in the neighborhood so we decided to take our changes. \\n\\nWe were there on a Saturday evening and the host informed that there is about 20 mins wait for a party of 4 so we decided to wait. Our table was ready in preciously 20 mins but while we were entering the restaurant one of the guest had heated argument with the owner/manager not sure what it was but surely they were bing kicked out. After we sat down the disgruntled customer again came in and threaten the owner/manager and we found out that now we are sitting on the table that they had occupied. (not sure how i feed about that!)\\n\\nWe placed our order of pasta and a bottle of wine to share.  Food was decent. two out of 4 dishes were 4/5 where as other two were 2/5 so averaging them at 3/5. The wine was quite small for the price but still it was fine. It was one of my friend's birthday and they did give us a complementary Tiramisu which was quite nice of them.\\n\\nNow when it came to billing, they gave us a bill with the food ordered by people whom they had kicked out( remember they were still on the same table that we had occupied now) added to it. Things go resolved quickly. Another thing which bugged me is that it was a cash only place. A place where 4 person meal cost about $120, it's odd to keep it cash only. They have ATM on premise but not a fan of paying $2.5 for the ATM changes and extra what the bank will change. Might now go back.\", u\"Came here for our wedding anniversary.  Food is clearly solid. Great salad, fantastic pasta and the fish was perfectly done. \\n\\nThere was however a wedding party that was (and of course for good reason) very boisterous. They crowded around our table for the first part of our dinner.\\n\\nI went and spoke to one of the staff, who turned out to be the owner, and asked to be moved to a quieter table when one opened up.\\n\\nThey kindly obliged. And at the end they comped our meal. This was in my mind overly generous, but extremely kind. Good food, kind service, wonderful setting...in an area generally starving for good food (dumbo)...can't go wrong with that!  Will be back for sure.\", u'Delizioso! From my Aperol spritz to my espresso and everything in between. The pasta was perfect and the branzino was moist and flavorful. Alfredo was an incredible host and I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner solo at the bar. Grazie mille!', u'Came here for brunch on a Saturday with a group of girls and we definitely enjoyed ourselves.\\n\\nNOTE: CASH ONLY!! There is an ATM inside but not sure what they charge.\\n\\nRESERVATIONS: Called 2 days in advance for a party of 10 for brunch on a Saturday and was able to make a reservation easily.  \\n\\nATMOSPHERE: The location couldn\\'t be better, it\\'s in DUMBO but located almost right in front of the famous Washington Street Manhattan bridge shot where two buildings frame the bridge and then through the bridge is the Empire State building.  Great for taking pictures beforehand or afterwards.\\n\\nThe inside is intimate, a bar to the left, lots of natural light and wooden tables with a movie being projected on the screen in the back.  It had a long table for the 10 of us and they also have a large table in the back that another group could fit at.  Definitely a cute place for brunch.  It has more of a dark/rustic vibe than a clean/minimalist/trendy vibe.\\n\\nFOOD: Their famous thing is the eggs in a cloud.  I felt that there were mixed reviews at the table, one the one hand it looks very cute and picture worthy but one girl said it was a little too \"light\" since the egg whites are whipped.  The portions here are not HUGE but not super small either and most dishes are under $13, which is good.\\n\\nKALE SALAD - trying to eat healthy I opted for a kale salad and added chicken.  Although there is no option to add meat you can if they have it on the menu (for example, they have a chicken panini so I was able to add it).  The salad was good because it had shavings of pecorino cheese which gave it a nice salty taste.  The dressing was light, but tasty and the chicken wasn\\'t bad.  It\\'s not the best kale salad but good to know they have options for those not eating carbs.\\n\\nOther dishes that looked good was the breakfast sandwich and the traditional old fashioned breakfast plate.\\n\\nOverall, a great pick for a Saturday brunch with a group of girls.', u'Great staff. The food is priced on the heavier side but it was flavorful. Very open floor plan and nice ambience.', u\"There are only a handful of affordable lunch options in DUMBO, but it's good to see that AlMar is there for when you want to treat yoself and spend just a *bit* more for an amazing sandwich. I would order their slow roasted pulled pork sandwich again in a heartbeat. The pork fell apart so easily, and there were all sorts of pickled veggies and onions mixed in.\\n\\nI ordered it to go, and was able to wait for it at the bar. The sandwich came out to a little over $12 with tax for a whole portion, but they actually pack you two halves, which is super convenient. I ended up saving half for the next day because it was pretty heavy (it was also delicious the next day). They also do a half sandwich and half soup or salad deal as well, so maybe that's the move. Or I guess just half a sandwich. Lots of options.\\n\\nCash only!\", u'Excellent pasta and ambience. Love the warm decor and feel of this place. A little in the higher end as far as pricing goes but the food is fresh and delicious and the quantities are pretty generous. Will definitely go back especially for their pesto pasta.', u'Cute restaurant, Great menu choices , reasonable price for delicious food. I must come back :)', u\"Al Mar\\nNY BK DUMBO\\n9pm Tuesday 15th November 2016\\nFour-ish Stars\\n\\nThey have the best chalkboard artist in town. We sat at the bar on this relatively quiet Tuesday evening. The dumbo cocktail had rye, Orange, and bitters. It was served in a taller rocks glass with three cold draft ice cubes. The drink was well balanced. For food: Tiff had scallops and mussels and I had the Rabbit Ragu. The food was solid but could have been better. The scallops were cooked perfectly with golden brown seat and layers of textural differences. The mussels were plentiful but had a bit of funk on them. The toasted version of their bread was infinitely better. The rabbit was a bit dry and the pasta was very al dents but I enjoyed it. The service was attentive but not suffocating. It is a bit pricey and it's CASH ONLY which they write on everything.\", u\"I came across it while looking for a  restaurant in the Dumbo area on a Saturday night.  The wait period to be seated was very short, it's very low key and they have a great wine selection. I had the crab cocktail with avocado and oranges for appetizer and it was a great combo.  Service was also great.\", u\"Great brunch! The ambience inside the restaurant has a very cozy feel to it. Limited menu, however, there is something for everyone! My table received the egg toast, egg in a cloud, and homemade pancakes, and I have to say it was all delicious! If you want a more traditional breakfast they even have an old fashioned breakfast with eggs, toast, and meat. Had a great latte and a great experience dining here at AlMar. Just don't forget that it is CASH ONLY! There are ATMs around if you forget.\", u\"Like the other reviews, I must caution this is CASH ONLY. Not a criticism just know before you go. \\n\\nWe happened upon Almar at an odd time - 3ish on a Sunday. They were still serving brunch and were able to get a seat right away.  The menu is simple but interesting. Pete got a porketta panini with broccoli rabe and I got a kale salad. We each asked for mozzarella to be substituted for the cheese our dish came with. This request was accommodated by the waitress and kitchen without issue.\\n\\nThe food was tasty with clean, fresh flavors. The panini's bread was soft and chewy in the best way. The broccoli rabe was so perfect and complimented the pork. The kale was crunchy and cut into thin strips to make it palatable. \\n\\nLots to like here.\", u\"We stopped at Almar for brunch on a Saturday while looking for an alternative spot to Atrium, due to the really long wait. I like the layout and decor of Almar. It's very inviting. We started at the bar, grabbing a cocktail while we waited. The menu is quite interesting and the cocktails we tried were all tasty. I especially like the New Fashioned, different take on a classic.\\n\\nAfter a short wait, we were seated and ordered. For brunch we had the Burger and the Eggs in a Cloud. Both were good, tasty and the presentation were very nice, especially the Eggs in a Cloud, which prepred egg whites in a way I have never seen before. You may be asking why I didn't score this higher? Well, while everything looked nice, nothing blew us away flavor wise. It was all very tasty, but I think we were expecting more in terms of flavors. Nothing was bad, just nothing was amazing. Since they are Italian themed, we may come back here for dinner to try out their proper faire. When I do, I will update this review then.\\n\\nOther things of note, Almar is actually rather reasonable price wise and the staff are great. If you happen to be in DUMBO and looking for a chill spot to have a bit, Almar is a good place to check out.\", u\"Updating my previous review for service and food quality during our (4 of us) second brunch trip.  15 minutes after placing the table's order our waitress came by the table to let us know that the kitchen was out of roast beef and that one of us would need to choose another option.  We did, but in the end the wait for the food was just not worth it.  Three of the dishes looked and tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for the 15 min it took to make the new dish.\\n\\nThe staff does not seem to know the menu very well and provided incorrect information about menu items, of which we did not realize until our dishes were served and it was too late.  \\n\\nThis place is in a great spot which is why they will continue to be busy, but the service/quality and cash-only requirements are major hits to Almar as a whole.\", u'I thought this spot was good - I had the lasagna and burger.  The lasagna was good with some good flavor from the tomato/marinara sauce...it was topped with a  good amount of cheese that made it even better.  The burger was solid - a nice, juicy burger that was cooked as requested at medium.\\n\\nThe service here was attentive...I think the staff did a good job of taking care of everyone despite the busy lunch atmosphere.', u\"I'm gonna keep this short and to the point because it's pretty basic - this is one of the only brunch spots in the area and I went there for the IMAX shift to spin studio so while walking around we popped in here and although it was crowded we got a seat pretty quickly. The service was not great. I don't know if they were shortstaffed or just because they were a little busy but they weren't slammed and we should've had a little better service.  \\n\\n first of all they were allowing children to actually sit at the bar and take up bar seats so we couldn't wait there for 10 minutes before table is ready which wasn't the end of the world but besides for allowing children to the bar and also hinder us from getting a drink which is not exactly smart on their part. And then once we were seated it took the waiter actually it took me asking for the waiter for him to actually come around. Once he did though I ordered a Frittata with I believe sausage and leaks, but I can't be positive and it was only $10 and more than worth the money. My friend had a shrimp salad and loved it and only ate half and took the other half home. Their body marys were really good as well, and overall for probably $20 apiece when a really nice relaxing brunch - it was a little warm inside, and a little loud with children running all over the place but that is to be expected and not something that would deter me from ever going back\", u'We had a little tea and chill here. Cash only, which is kind of annoying, but a nice place.', u\"Love the food , but old guy who served the food was very rude .dinner ; forget it , wont come back here. Water was over , he never asked how's the food ? Why do people work when they don't like their job .\", u\"Arrived during the week for lunch and was immediately seated. However, I feel like we got the worst seats in the house considering the restaurant was fairly empty - my boyfriend's chair was wobbly and it was an awkward spot. I wouldn't say the menu has many options but I'd compare to maybe Panera in the sense that they have soups, salads, paninis. I tried a half smoked salmon panini (definitely recommend) with a side of asparagus which enough to have me more than full.\"], u'199.Sip Unwine': [u'This is my new favorite neighborhood spot.\\n\\nThe drinks and food are amazing. My favorite cocktail is the Hummingbird. I\\'d tell you my favorite dish but they sell out of it often! lol\\n\\nThe staff and owners are friendly and personable and I simply adore the fact that the bartender remembers my drink! \\n\\nIt\\'s very intimate and ideal for a date or an evening with good friends and good conversation. To help you \"unwine\" they have conversation cards on the table that encourage you to put down the cellphone!\\n\\nFinally a place in Flatbush that is classy, sophisticated and BLACK OWNED!\\n\\nDo not walk - run to Sip Unwine!', u\"What a great find right on Flatbush! \\nINTERIOR AND DECOR: B+\\nThere is outdoor seating in the back, a small bar and a few tables inside the rather dark interior. It IS kinda dark, but I thought it was a romantic dark, not a creepy one. The music is HOT! Caribbean beats that you can groove to as you eat but not loud enough to annoy or prohibit conversation.\\nSERVICE: A++\\nI believe we were helped by Rose. Friendly, knowledgable enough about the menu to give us a few suggestions. Attentive without being bothersome. Our orders were taken quickly and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.\\nFOOD: A++\\nWe had the bbq lamb which came with mashed potatoes, veggie flatbread and a side of macaroni pie.\\nThe lamb was fabulous! Delicious and well seasoned. You get 4 decent sized pieces in your order that are beautifully plated. The mashed potatoes tasted homemade. Definitely not from a box.\\nThe veggie flatbread was also great. Nice and crispy and full of veggies. Next time I'd love to try it with the jerk chicken.\\nMacaroni pie was Trini style, more of a casserole than the classic American mac and cheese. It's pretty hard to find a good macaroni pie, but Sip Unwine does it really well. Nice and cheesy with that crisp top. Loved it!\\nI can't wait to return and try other menu items!\", u'Well.... this place is def a whole in the wall\\nAnd o.m.g\\nSo their food is absolutely amazing!!! My fiance got lychee martini and lyche mojito both tasted delicious and were made strong\\nI got a between the sheets which was okay and a fresh berry drink which was INCREDIBLY STRONG ( not on menu but they have a chalk board on their wall w other drinks on it)\\nTheir food was amazing!!!!!!!! We shared parmesian fries which were good\\nKing pao calamari which were literally amazing and cast iron mac and cheese with jerk chicken which was phenominal it was sooo good they really made it amazing\\nThe only thing i disliked was that their air conditioner was a bit weak so when we got our food (which was hot) we felt really hot eating \\nAnyways 4.5/5 from us', u\"I've been dying to come to this establishment ever since I heard a new spot opened up in Flatbush. This place did not disappoint! Their happy hour drink specials are on point. The drinks are strong. The staff is welcoming. Most of all, the food is to die for. The wings and Mac and Cheese are a must! I look forward to coming here again and trying other appetizing options on their menu!\", u'Sip Unwine is really spectacular in some areas and lacking in others. \\n\\nI will start with the good. Their food is freaking delicious! The tamarind wings are sticky and crispy and savory. Their Parmesan fries are perfect. And their jerk corn is really good as well. I didnt love the calamari but my gf did so I wont knock em. I saw some other plates come out and I have no doubt it was delicious.  Honestly the food is so good I am more than willing to wait for them to work out the other kinks. \\n\\nSo here are the kinks. The place is really dimly lit and a bit lacking in the design area. They tried but there is basically a couple trinkets sprinkled throughout the restaurant. Some more art would be a nice touch. Some nicer napkins or drink coasters would go a long way. \\n\\nThe service was slow. Not walk out in frustration slow but still needs improvement. Its a new place so they only have one front of house and one back of house person when I visited on a Tuesday. That meant extended wait times for drinks. \\n\\nThe drinks are also priced a lil high for flatbush. The rum punch was $12. It was good but not better or stronger than the $10 rum punches throughout the rest of flatbush and it took a while. \\n\\nI think its 3.5 star place that I will gladly visit again. And will be 4 or 5 stars when growing pains are worked out.', u'A gem. Perfect for a date or speak easy meet up with friends. Great cocktails and amazing bites to accompany it.', u'I came in as an out-of-towner and experienced amazing service from the owner, all of the staff, great food, great wine, great music.

We stopped in to celebrate my friends 51st birthday.  He had an entree made exactly as requested.  Delicious meals all around. The staff was very accommodating.  I hiighly recommend this place.  I found it by accident, now I take two trains just to get here.', u'The second thing I noticed about this small restaurant was how gracious and attentive our waiter was; that man was doing his best and very on point. . I did not get his name but this gentleman was nothing but professional.  What was the first thing? Lack of air conditioning!. It was about 90 degrees outside and felt like 83 degrees inside.   The flat bread pizza is amazing, the mac n cheese w jerk is good and wings are standard. Great food and great service . Will highly recommend of they promise to get functioning AC.', u\"Saw this place one day on my way home. Told my good good girlfriend and we was on it lol. We had the best time here. Our hostess was nice the food was goooooood. It's a good spot to chop it up and they have happy hour lol my kind of place. Gotta get with your good good girlfriend and check it out. You can take ya boo there too. Just go\", u'Went last night with my husband and a friend for the first time and had the best time there! Rose is a great bartender, very friendly and sweet. We had Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling. Chilled out for a few hours and then went home. Very nice local bar with good vibes. We are happy to have found our new local spot to kick back. Their backyard opens next weekend and they will also have dessert on the menu.', u\"New Neighborhood Go-to. Nice Lounge with great music and good vibes. Happy hour specials through the week and wing specials on Tuesday's. I highly recommend the salmon with kale salad (so good). And for the wings I've had all flavors but my ultimate fav are the pineapple wings. Sweet with a little kick to it (yum). Will definitely recommend to friends.\", u'The food and service is amazing. I highly recommend the spicy Asian wings and the jerk fries. Laid back chill spot with good music, drinks and great food!! Will definitely be back.', u\"I came here on opening day and I'm in love! Such great food and service! \\n\\nDefinitely give the salmon and mac n cheese a try... DELICIOUS! \\n\\nA great place to unwind after a stressful day at work. Will come again!\", u\"I had a great experience from beginning to end! It is good to know that a great place like this is nearby my home. I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for place to hang out and chill. Good drinks, good food, good prices and good ambiance. It doesn't get than that!\", u'Amazing Place. Everyone must try ! The food is unexplainable you have to try for yourself !', u'Calamari, asain wings and the chefs soup of the day. \\n\\nMeal was exciting and the spices of the Caribbean pot stood out on my taste buds with every bite. Great place to sit and lounge with friends.', u\"Pleasantly surprised after visiting this cozy, colorful, and inviting bar! The dim lighting offers an intimate feel. I ordered the vegan bowl and it was excellent! I've been craving it all week. The staff was friendly and attentive and my rum punch was delicious! I cannot wait to return.\", u'The food was great, drinks also great. We had the veggie flatbread. Zero complaints. Definitely a new neighborhood \"go-to\"'], u'205.James': [u\"Finally grabbed brunch here and it was not only really, cute ambience but delicious food. \\n\\nFor the record, best bloody mary in Prospect Heights. \\n\\nI ordered the kale salad which was HUGE and most definitely massaged...not joking. hah. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp with polenta. He thought it could've used more salt but I thought it was just fine. Our waitress was also very attentive and good humored. \\n\\nCan't wait to come back and try the balance of their menus, especially the lemon ricotta pancakes :)\", u\"James looks like a little restaurant in a summer movie. It's away from the main streets, surrounded by houses, which makes the place feel even more intimate. But that's all the restaurant has going for it.\\n\\nCharred Octopus\\nHeavy on the char, which made the entire dish taste more like ash than anything else. The fingerlings had a soggy/chewy texture.\\n\\nHerb Fries \\nLimp. Every single one.\\n\\nHeirloom Tomatoes w/ Sheep's Feta\\nThe best thing we had all night! The tomatoes were juicier than summer's best watermelons.\\n\\nChardonnay, Eastern Mountain Daisy, Augustine Spritz\\nAll the drinks tasted bland.\\n\\nTable placement\\nI wish restaurants paid attention to how it arranges tables. Every time the person at the next table moved, they bumped into my friend's chair, which shook our table.\", u'After moving from SF to BK I was searching for a place with simple yet delicious food as is the SF style. I love this place. I have been here for dinner as well as brunch and I was very happy both times. I feel like James offers seasonal and fresh food that feels clean and healthy but is also indulgent in all the right ways. I kinda want to make this place my go to neighborhood restaurant. I feel the staff is very friendly. \\n\\nHere is what i would say is the only downside. I feel like the cocktails are not at the level I want them to be at. I feel like they are missing a clean fresh approach that I love in the food. I am not knocking stars off of it because I have only tried cocktails here and not beer or wine so I feel like I cant take off stars for just that. Plus I dream about the food at night in my sleep. \\n\\nOverall a must try.', u\"Always drove by here but never stopped in so for Friday night dinner we specially planned in the area and remembered this (not so?) hidden gem. \\n\\nThe decor is classy but the ambience is relaxed. We were greeted immediately and a table was set for us a a high chair fit perfectly in the middle of the dining area in front of the bar. The baby got to converse with the bartenders and many other diners. \\n\\n\\nStarted with the special peach, cucumber and radish salad. All ingredients fresh but dressing could of used a bit more flavor. Husband loves his oysters. Scallop entree was cooked perfectly and cauliflower pur\\xe9e paired well. We also got a side of the Parmesan truffle fries which were served warm, crispy, and flavorful!  Husband got a summer squash salad that he thought was ok. \\n\\nService was excellent!  Can't wait to come back for brunch and Monday night burgers!\", u'Not blown away by this place.  Wanted to love it, and it was cute, but nothing exceptional.  Its in a really cute neighborhood and has that local vibe I live.  I loved the ambiance, but the food was nothing to brag about.  I only came here for brunch and never dinner, so I can only comment on the brunch.  I actually disliked the lemon ricotta pancakes.  They looked great but tasted bad.  I would definitely give this place a try again if I am in the area.', u\"Absolutely LOVELY experience.  My coworker and I were really hungry before a late dinner so we decided to head over at 5 when they opened to split something and grab a quick drink.  We split the burger - which may have been one of the best burgers I've ever tasted + fries.  Let me just say this place is worth the hubbub.\\n\\nThe literally had a line at 5 pm - so you know it's good.  The bartender was a sweetheart and made fabulous cocktails.  If I lived in NY I would be a regular.  Two thumbs wayyy way up.\", u'Excellent local place in the neighborhood! The sea scallops and the kale salad are must try items.', u\"I've been here twice now and really enjoyed it both times. \\n\\nThe food: Standout dishes are the roasted beets, skate wing with bok choy, spaghetti squash and brown butter sauce, and the crispy pork belly. Had those last night and they did not disappoint. Eggplant fries are really good (although probably something you can get similarly elsewhere?). The truffle parm fries are also quite good, as well as the Brussels sprouts. One callout: if you want your food staggered, ask. The first time we came here, all 5 mini plates came at once and things got cold. This time, when we asked, it was timed perfectly.\\n\\nThe drinks: Very good. I've had their old fashioned as well as their take on a 'colada' and both were tasty - but my real favorite is all of the dessert wine and liquor they offer. I love the sambuca they keep behind the bar and they serve it with the traditional three coffee beans, which I love!\\n\\nThe atmosphere: First of all, I am very appreciative that the tables are spaced a reasonable distance apart. Thank you. However, when we went last night, it was a little (read: very) warm inside which was annoying. Overall, the place is small and charming. \\n\\nThey don't take reservations but we went at 7pm on a Friday night and immediately got a table for two. Wait staff is very friendly and accommodating. This will definitely continue to be one of my go-to spots nearby!\", u'Height of summer\\nNo air conditioner\\nWe have to suffer\\nTo get cocktails with killer\\nFries with diller', u'Longing for the days of a homey meal and genuine customer service\\n \\nThis week I enjoyed a milestone birthday.  I went back to my childhood neigborhood in Brooklyn to celebrate.  Prospect Heights has grow a bit over the decades and now is dotted with more restaurants, ice cream parlor and boutiques.  We landed at the James Restaurant, a quaint neighborhood spot with a menu that would rival many artisanal restaurants but a wait staff with the skills and manners of a Tasmanian devil.  \\n\\nFirst the food.  As we settled into our meal we were met with a mix bag of flavors and quality in preparation.  The chefs strength is meat not seafood.  The meat dishes (burger, hanger steak and short ribs) were seasoned, cooked and served to perfection.  By contrast, the seafood dishes we overcooked, dried out and lacked flavor (octopus, trout and scallops).\\n\\nNext up the service. Over the course of the meal, the quality of the food and the ambiance of the restaurant was marred by spotty service and the ruddiest, most unprofessional and non-attentive wait staff.  As the first customers seated for the evening, we hungrily watched as the first seating of guests ordered, ate and departed.  When we asked about our meals,  waitress was belligerent  and instead of checking in with the kitchen about the food decided it was more important to discuss us with the other wait staff.    \\n\\nWhen asked again about \\nthe food, the waitress threw more shade and when confronted about her behavior made excuses through a thick layer of attitude. While the tense conversation was defused with our slender dirty blond waitress, the staff\\'s posture afterward was to avoid the table and artificially add the gratuity to the bill.  \\n\\n yes the entitled, ill-mannered waitress was unhinged from reality.  After shutting down gratuity surcharge down, my party departed and reminisced how we longed for the old days in Prospect Heights when you could get a delicious homey meal with a side order of warm and welcoming customer service.\\n\\nI would not recommend this place.  With so many culinary gems in the neighborhood, service is a critical marker for setting these \"gems\" apart.  And, based on our experience with the slender blond waitress, the service at the James Restaurant is epically poor and warrants avoiding this place.', u\"My wife and I have been to James countless times in the last six years, when we moved to the neighborhood. I gave two stars because James was consistently really, really good up until about two years ago, but it's been a steady decline ever since. \\n\\nYou order a burger medium, and what you're served is either actually still bloody or very well done-- just not medium. The servers are aloof, the food mediocre, and it can take ages for your plates to arrive. And that's all at pretty high prices. I wouldn't mind the prices if the food and service were still really great.\\n\\nWe went to James for dinner tonight and will not be back. We waited for a long time before our drink and dinner orders were taken, even though the restaurant was only a little over half full (on a Wednesday night). It took half an hour after that for my cocktail to arrive. I asked the waiter about it and he said he put the order in, but no apology. Our appetizers arrived an hour after we ordered, and again, followed up with the server. We're looking around and others who had been seated after us were already done with their entrees, and some had paid their bills and left.\\n\\nSo now it's after 9:30pm (and we arrived at 8pm). My wife asked the waiter to pack up our entrees to go, because it had taken so long. She never does that! Again, no apology from the server, and worse-- no entrees. We wait 10 more minutes and then our entrees are brought out to us, plated. But now we're ready to go and ask again if they could please be wrapped up to go. We finally get the check and they charged us for everything. No apology, no taking our drinks off the check. Not cool. I would normally be happy to pay the relatively high prices if the food were exceptional, if we actually received our meals in a reasonable amount of time, or, if we didn't, if the server acknowledged the oversight. \\n\\nWon't do this again.\", u\"Dropped in here one Sunday for brunch just before 11:30. We were expecting a wait but were greeted and seated quickly by the friendly wait staff. Quickly the place filled up (not a big space) but at no point did we wonder if our waiter forgot us. He tended to us with just the right amount of care and attention, took our orders, recommended drinks, chit chatted long the way. The food came out within reasonable time and it was delicious! The ambiance is just the right amount of hip and neighborhood chill. It wasn't loud. And the patrons all were pleasant people. Overall an excellent brunch experience and it will continue to be a main stay for me!\", u'Good\\nFood and\\nCocktails but\\nThere is often\\nA wait. Nice choice for dates or anniversaries.', u'I\\'m kind of blown away by this place\\'s super-high rating. I ate here with a friend for a special night out a couple weeks ago, and we both ordered the scallops entree. \\n\\nHow shall I put this? \\n\\nFor $30 -- THIRTY DOLLARS -- I was served a tiny dollop of whipped cauliflower topped with an even tinier tangle of greens and -- wait for it -- four scallops ... FOUR!\\n\\nI\\'d call it lucky if the entire plate cleared 200 calories. Add a glass of wine and we were each in for $40+, not including tip.\\n\\nAfterward, we went down the street for some tacos because we were starving. I\\'ve been around the block in life a few times and \"eating after eating\" was a first for me.\\n\\nOur waiter could not have been nicer, but I felt (and still feel) so grossly ripped off by this place. I\\'m writing this in the hope that management reads this and decides to be much more respectful of their customer\\'s money, but I certainly will not be back.', u'We came here for our anniversary dinner and they were very accommodating with us bringing our 2 year old. Our child loved their eggplant fries, which is such a unique idea. My husband tried the James Revenge drink which he liked a lot and he equated it to being like a Manhattan. We tried their black kale salad, which was very interesting. I am not sure I would get it again but it was pretty good. Next my husband got their hangar steak while I got the risotto special. The kale in the hangar steak was delicious. Both the steak and risotto were great. Overall, it was a great dining experience and I want to come back and try their brunch. It is a small space though so it does get filled early. We went for dinner at 5:30pm and by 6:30 it was pretty much filled.', u\"Simple review: tiny portions, enormous bill. Place is certainly nice enough, service good....but you're going to spend a lot of dough for micro-sized food. This obviously is fine with some who have lots of money and thin waists, but if you have an appetite and no trust fund, look elsewhere.\", u\"I really wanted to love this place - it's interior is cozy and inviting and the smell coming from the kitchen would make anyone drool, not only an overworked art administrator on a Monday night. The restaurant was recommended by a friend who was running a bit late; when he finally arrived at 6pm, the place started slowly getting busy.\\n\\nSad fact #1: not even a slice of bread was offered toys as we waited almost 40 minutes (!!!) for a *plate of oysters.* Nada. At the point we finally gotten to our burgers - Monday is a burger night there - we were seriously concerned about whether we'll make our 8pm show nearby. \\n\\nSad fact #2: while advertised as something extraordinary, my Chef's Burger was not memorable in any way. While fried to textbook medium rare, it was unappetizingly cold inside. Brioche it was sitting on was quite delicious, but herb  fries tasted of nothing but salt, and three lettuce leaves don't really count as salad (especially when there's no substitutions for any of the things on the burger menu.)\\n\\nSad fact #3: the chocolate tarts spent way too much time in the freezer - it was heavy and flavorless (which I attribute to the fact it was e even too cold.) \\n\\nMy friend seemed more pleased with his fish sandwich burger and pear crumble, but when it came to setting the bill (almost a $100 without any drinks or coffee), the mood was not particularly jolly. \\n\\nMy general impression is that James is a victim of its own popularity - by 7pm the place was filled to the brim and the three servers were obviously struggling to keep up. Unless the owners take a closer look at what's going on, I doubt I'd be giving James another chance.\", u'First: A delicious Gibson. The bartender asked if I wanted it shaken or stirred. I said: \"You tell me.\" Solution: stirred. When giving my drink he explained that a stirred gin cocktail will look \"blue\" -- maybe because of some magical emulsification process? Science aside: perfect drink. Very pleased. And more educated!\\n\\nSecond: the service was excellent and my burger, just fine. Rare, like I like, super charred crust, moist interior. Pro Tip (or People Tip): a rare burger with a well-charred exterior is like crispy beef tartare. This is like a dream made mortal. Next time I\\'ll order it without the cheese. Because it\\'s not necessary - and if you need cheese to eat your meat there are other places to go with cheaper burgers, friends.  \\n\\nThird: enormous amount of fries--fries-loving folks, jump on this; decent-looking bun (didn\\'t eat); 4-5 mesclun dressed leaves, as garnish. \\n\\nMaybe an offer of a bit of shaved onion; and some house-made non-mayo slaw (whole cumin seeds? whole mustard seeds?). $18.00 bucks is a tiny bit steep but not a terrifying markup for a grass-fed Angus product. \\n\\nI\\'ll happily go back for both. \\n\\nSmall aside: this place is LOUD. Like no-sound-insulation-LOUD. \\n\\nBe prepared. And don\\'t dine with your elderly mentor who has recently lost his hearing aids.', u\"Had dinner here and the scallops were delicious but the portion was teeny. Felt more like a $30 appetizer, geesh. They could've went a little heavier on the braised oxtail and cauliflower that accompanied it. \\n\\nThey were pretty packed on Saturday at 6 PM, and we had to wait 30 minutes at the bar for a table. I recommend making a reservation. Because they were so busy the staff wasn't super attentive. I'd maybe go back on a slower night and get the much more filling and cheaper and delicious burger and fries my partner ordered.\", u\"If you look at other reviews, you will see that most say the food is great.\\n\\nI agree.\\n\\nFood is wonderful.\\n\\nSo why one star?\\n\\nI have never been treated more rudely by a wait staff or manager in my life!\\nWhen I complained to the manager about the server being rude, he said, she had complained that I was rude! \\nThe rest of my party and other people around, basically dropped their jaws at his rudeness! \\nI refused to get into a brawl with this man. \\n\\nIf you read other reviews here, you will see that rudeness by the staff is the major complaint.\\n\\nSo, if you don't mind dropping $650 for 4 people for good food, but treated like you are dirt,\\n\\nThis restaurant is for you!!\"], u'186.Oceanview Cafe': [u\"Sweet! Step inside and you're a world away. I feel like I just had lunch in a small city on the Black Sea. Get the okroshka.\", u'Do not be put off by the coffee shop level decor, the food is worthy of finer environs.\\n\\nNext to the side tables, digital picture frames display shots of the food, and the plates actually looks that good on arrival.\\n\\nWe began with an excellent special - a bean salad with tomatoes, peppers, parsley and dill. There were some crushed nuts in there - not the walnuts I associate with Georgian food. The white beans, similar to Gigandes but a bit smaller, were perfectly cooked, the dressing nice and light. The pelmeni were tasty too, in a little butter with sour cream on the side. I suppose I would have liked a bit more seasoning, and they could have been drained better.\\n\\nFor main courses, we both had lamb. My partner had the lamb shish kebab with grilled vegetables. The lamb was tasty and tender, but still was outshone by the masterfully executed vegetables.  Leg of lamb tuned out to be a large braised shank. Very meaty and tender, presented in a creole style sauce of braised celery, peppers and tomatoes. It could have used a bit of heat or spice. On the plate, some nicely cooked cabbage and a mound of delicious kasha.\\n\\nService was quite good.\\n\\nThe only dissonant note was my Heineken, which was barely chilled. You may, or may not like the video programming on the Dynex monitors. Chacun son gout.', u'Oceanview Cafe?  More like Under the Q-Train Tracks View Cafe. Misnomer aside, this place turned out to be the perfect way to cap off a recent afternoon at Coney Island:\\n\\nAnyway, wasn\\'t at all sure what to expect and was bracing myself for the possibility of an empty, glum dining space.  Happily, I could not have been more wrong.  In fact, there was a steady flow of diners the entire time we were there, on a Sunday evening.  Plus, the ambiance exuded an intangible Old World charm that I found enchanting. Service was also pleasant and friendly.\\n\\nAs for the food, I found it almost as bewitching as the atmosphere:\\n\\nGreek Salad:  I\\'ve noticed that Eastern European restaurants often use ripe olives in place of traditional kalamatas, and this spot was no different.  It\\'s a travesty if you ask me.  It also came with a small, metal tureen full of chopped dried beef, which I didn\\'t expect and wasn\\'t into at all.   But this being said, there was still plenty to like about this Salad.  It featured gorgeously ripe, red tomatoes and a really interesting salty white cheese that tasted like a cross between Feta and Ricotta Salata.  \\n\\nCold Borscht:  Growing up, my Mom used to make a version of this that involved throwing  cooked beets into the blender with some stock, chilling, and then swirling lots of sour cream into the mixture. This was was not that.  Instead, it featured shredded cooked beets in a cold broth.  Refreshing, but no match for Mom\\'s. \\n\\nVareniki aka Stuffed Dumplings:  Out of the three different fillings that we tried, Meat was the winner, if only \\'cause I\\'d like to order these again when I return.  Cherry came in second \\'cause duh... Cherry.  These were filled with Sour Cherries and topped with a Cherry Sauce.  Got \\'em for dessert and while interesting, would probably go with something else next time.  Compared to these two, Potato, while good, tasted very standard.  Plus I was pining for the more enticing sounding Salty Cheese Vareniki that hubby talked me out of choosing.\\n\\nLamb Kabab:  I didn\\'t see an option on the menu to order Kabobs a la carte, so we went with an entree, mostly for the kid.  He insisted on getting Fries as his side, but had it been up to Mama, we\\'d\\'ve gotten Kasha. Luckily, as it turns out, those Fries hit just the right crispy, salty notes.  The Lamb was tender and just as fellow Yelper, Stefany V. describes, \"more beefy than gamey.\" With one of the bites I tried, though, I encountered some gristle.\\n\\nKompot:  Essentially sweet \\'n tangy Cherry Juice with Sour Cherries at the bottom.  Lovely. \\n\\nVodka: If you want to do a shot, there are various labels to choose from, including Smirnoff, Absolut and a rather sketchy sounding \\'Russian,\\' which intriguingly is the priciest at $5.  I opted for the latter and gotta say, it went down smoothly, with no harsh aftertaste.  \\n\\nUltimately, I think what I loved most about this spot is that it made me feel transported.  To where, you may ask? Well, someplace far, far from Brooklyn.  Some days that\\'s a good thing.  A very good thing, indeed.', u'Bright and airy and 2 blocks from the beach.  The place serves up Russian comfort food.  I tried the dumplings with potato and mushroom.  It was good and you get about 20 small dumplings.\\nI also had the combuca to drink which was  very good.\\n\\nThe most interesting part of the meal was the guy from Georgia- the country- who asked to join me!\\nSo random but he helped me ordered and was interesting to talk to.  So there you go -- a very authentic meal indeed!', u'Oceanview Cafe does not have an ocean view. What it does have is a large menu of classic eastern European dishes and some American staples with a Euro twist. Their fish soup has plenty of fresh dill and a light, flavorful broth. Their lamb kabobs are perfectly cooked with a great gravy dipping sauce, but oddly tasted more beefy than gamey.  The blini with caviar and the pierogis look to be popular choices here, too. Order a Baltika and check out the old school photos of Nicolas Cage on the wall before you go.', u\"4 stars for food and 5 stars for service, which is truly impeccable. The waiters are so nice and helpful, they really accommodate and give honest suggestions about the menu. Best things tried: home fries, pelmeni, fried cubed liver, salad Olivie, most soups, avocado salad with sesame dressing, fried tilapia fillet, and surprisingly...omelette (it's crispy and fluffy with the add-ons inside). We are regulars at this point.\", u'as we browsed through the Russian restaurant options in Brighton Beach, we made our decision on this small restaurant on Brighton Beach Avenue. They didn\\'t look flashy, and had no obnoxious \"only for tourists\" vibe (expensive bad food) to it. We didn\\'t want to go to a tourists spot, but where actual locals (Russians, Ukrainians, etc.) would go and eat. This place looked just right.\\n\\nThe price might seem a bit high, if you don\\'t know how much food you are getting. It was rather large portion on a large plate, you can see the size in the photo here. Pretty big, right? But it was so tasty that we finished the dish without effort.  It also had pickled veggies as well, which was nice pallet cleanser.\\n\\nI heard they serve really great desserts also, but we were very full after our meal. So, we decided to get coffee and tea without dessert. The cappuccino came in a nice glass mug and sugar stirring stick! The tea came in the traditional tea glass holders, which was amazing!!! I loved the traditional look, and it came with tea bag (I asked for Earl Grey), lemon slices, and preserves. Perfect way to end the meal.\\n\\nOverall, we really enjoyed the experience. The waiters were very nice, didn\\'t speak perfect English which added to our \"Russian experience.\" They were super polite, and provided efficient, fast service. Read my full review of this restaurant and food on my blog, foodlovergirl.', u\"Came here for lunch with 2 friends on a Sunday afternoon. The place was pretty lively but not crowded so we were seated right away. Our waiter was a young blond gentleman, looked like he was 19 and adorable, and was very polite throughout the whole time. We ordered 3 items to split amongst ourselves - the mushroom julienne, the blini (Russian crepe like pancakes) with caviar and the pierogis with mushroom and sauerkraut topped with fried onions. Each dish we tried was more delicious than the last. The blini disappeared first, the pierogis were not over-fried or too oily, and the julienne was in a delectable light cream sauce that it was my favorite julienne I had ever tasted (considering I'm used to getting it from the Russian supermarkets across the street, there was a distinct and improved difference of getting it from an actual restaurant and having it fresh). It's also nice that you get a bread basket and can have refills so you can scoop up any sauce left over on your plates. And it's funny to see the pictures of Nicolas Cage on the wall from a 2005 movie because I actually can recall when he was in that neighborhood filming.\", u\"...living in this neighborhood for the past 15 years I have to say that this is No.1 on my recommendation list for anyone looking to experience Russian culture. Being Russian and having tried the dishes served here thousands of times in my 37 years of existence it's hard to impress me but you can't fake Russian cuisine. I grew up with 3-Grandmas and each had their own style of cooking. So do the ladies working in the kitchen here. I believe there is two of them and they bang out dish after dish of awesomeness. The staff is always nice and on point and I really appreciate that it is always the same fellas. I took some of my close friends from Astoria a couple of weeks ago and they just had a blast! If you really want a true Russian experience bring a bottle of Vodka and call me tomorrow.\", u\"Placed order for pick up 2 1/2 hrs prior, but still waited 15mins at the restaurant.\\nThe food overall was too spicy; chicken teryaki was just too spicy and had to be washed to be edible.  The lobster bisque was just ok, but the portion too small for the price.\\nThe duck was horrendous, and way overpriced.  \\nAnyway, it's a no go for me.\", u\"As a born and bred Russian, I have high expectations of food and little expectations of service (no wide smiles expected). This place was perfect - food was delicious and service was prompt and courteous without any unnecessary gimmicks. Everything tasted fresh , and exactly as it should! Please come to this unassuming cafe for your taste of Russia. You won't regret it.\", u'After reading about this place on Gothamist, my husband and I decided to give it a shot when we were in Brighton Beach for the day. When we walked in, we knew we had made a good choice immediately. The decor is nothing fancy or flashy, but was clean and lovely. The seats were all filled with people who live in the neighborhood. The waiters were all Polish and Russian. We knew this would be a very authentic experience. We ordered the avocado salad, the salty cheese varenyky, and the potato varenyky. The avocado salad was interesting: avocados, tomatoes, some other sort of starchy root vegetables all in a teriyaki sauce. That was the odd part. The varenyky were DELICIOUS. Little boiled pockets of cheese and potato, lightly cooked in butter and served with sour cream. The cheese inside the varenyky was very interesting and not what I expected. It was mild with a little bit of a sour taste to it. Very delicious. The potato varenyky were served with fried onions which went perfectly with them. These were very tasty and very heavy, which I assume most Russian and Polish food is. \\n\\nI saw some people drinking tea in these awesome metal and glass cups and putting what looked like jam right into the tea. It was interesting! It was too hot for us to try that, but I would love to go back and give it a shot! This was a great meal, which I felt like was pretty authentic. I would definitely come back!', u\"Family friendly Russian cafe! Great food and always great service! Guys are really working hard. It's really hard to find good Russian place with good service but this is like home cooked food plus great service. If you are in Brighton beach check it out! I love pelmeni and borch!\", u'This place is a gem. I came here with my two sisters to unwind. The food was pure comfort and the service was warm and welcoming. I highly recommend the smoked whitefish and potato appetizer, all the palmeni, and the tea and preserves.', u'Delicious and tasty Russian food in Brighton Beach. Casually decided to eat here and I was extremely impressed. The food is fresh and very tasty and the service is excellent. The Russian salad is amazing as well as the soup.', u\"I absolutely love this place and have been coming here for years! I've even brought native Russians here and they have all enjoyed the food. There isn't one thing I've tried that I wouldn't recommend; everything truly tastes homemade. I'm honestly drooling, thinking about all the delicious items that are served here. The herring is perfect as an appetizer, every one of their soups is fantastic, mashed potatoes and  are perfect, homemade potatoes with mushrooms are to die for. The service is always great; waiters speak both Russian and English and are always extremely polite and accommodating.\", u\"Very nice restaurant.\\n\\nSimple, good and the waiters are very nice!\\n\\nBtw, I just noticed that it's the restaurant were Nicolas Cage and Jared Letto went in the film : lord of war\\n\\nTook : \\nBlinis and borsch, both perfect (specially during winter)\", u\"This is a great Russian diner.  They have a wonderful selection, great food and great service.  The prices are very reasonable too.  The only reason I'm taking off a star is due to limited space and poor decor.  If they would only get a larger, freshly renovated room they would be a solid 5 stars!\", u\"Great food for reasonable prices! My friends and i went there after going to the beach because wr found the place on yelp. My favorites were the  avocado salad, the meat vareniki, and the Ukrainian borscht! The people were friendly and they had pictures of their food displayed on the wall so you see the pictures of what's on the menu!\", u'Best syrniki in the world!\\n\\nVery clean cafe with outstanding traditional Russian food. \\n \"C\"- is my favorite breakfast and I can travel an hour  or more from my house just to have them.\\n\\n\\nThey serve coffee latte with a very cute sugar candy.'], u'101.Lima Mill Basin': [u'Enjoyed a wonderful meal in this hidden gem. The service was lovely and we were hungry.\\nWe started with drinks. I wanted a savignon blanc. They only had Pinot grigio but it was wonderful. My friend had the white sangria and enjoyed it too. My friend\\'s daughter liked her lemonade. \\nWe then ordered some appetizers:\\nManchego Croquettas-Cute, but very small and overly salty\\nGuacamole with tostones-tasty chunky guacamole with fresh tostones as a  handy\"vehicle\" for the guacamole\\nLeche de tigre: shrimp cocktail around a large glass of ceviche in white marinade. Refreshing and delicious\\nCeviche de pescado:Diced fish marinated in lemon juice with a small fried sweet potato (would have preferred the larger boiled one that is usually served with this dish) and large peruvian corn. This was my favorite dish\\nI also tried the  Entree: Arroz Chaufa with seafood-Fresh, flavorful, not overly fried, with 2 mussels and a nice amount of calamari and other seafood. \\nWe shared a tres leches for dessert-tasty and sweet.\\nToward the end of our meal we were treated to live Peruvian music.\\nThe cheque was kind of high for the portion sizes, but the food was very good and the service was excellent.', u\"Advice: Order out, do not dine in. \\n\\nI came here on a Wednesday night, arguably not a busy night regularly. We ordered our food at 7:20 and didn't get anything until about 8:30. We ordered the steak churasco, half chicken and a seafood fried rice. It took about an hour to prep steak, rotisserie chicken and a fried rice. It was confusing because there were only 3 tables. We were apologized to by I assumed the manager and told there was only one cook in the kitchen. One cook for a restaurant that can support 12 tables? The manager tried to make things better by comping a dessert, which also ran out....it was just the perfect storm.\\n\\nDespite the wait time, the food wasn't bad but waiting an hour for your meal makes the blood boil and anything taste less palatable.\", u\"Wow where do I start the food took so long to come. Everything was cold and I mean everything even the appetizers. The sangria was filled with ice so I'm pretty sure I was very hydrated more the buzzed. I would avoid never coming here again.\", u'I ordered Jalea 1/2 on Seamless\\nThe delivery was prompt, but the food is bland and overcooked, mostly calamari that tasted like rubber. The so called \"homemade salsa\" is red onion in the lemon juice and pepper.\\nThe portion was very small, but when I tasted the food it did not bother me anymore--it went to garbage anyway', u\"This a wonderful and fantastic Peruvian restaurant. You will not be disappointed for a date. Dinner with friend or family.... The 1/2 of chicken is to die for... and don't forget about the green sauce.... so delicious. It is a small restaurant but big enough for the area. The inside is so beautiful with a spend feeling and also include a small bar for drinks. Take out is the big thing there... There are always orders coming in for pick up or delivery.... Happy Eating!\", u'Came here for dinner after a movie, and apparently we just beat the night crowd. We were seated quickly when we got there. We got empanadas for the appetizer which was really tasty. I got the Jalea and my wife got the lamb chops both of which were really tasty. I got a chicken to go which was delicious as well. The green sauce was really good with a nice kick. Sangria was on point I got the red my wife got the white we both enjoyed our sangrias which were nice and strong. Also, there was a live band on Friday which was unexpected especially in this part of Brooklyn which was a nice touch to the dinner experience. Also, the waitress was really nice and attentive during our dinner which was much appreciated, and the owner checked in on us twice to make sure we enjoyed our experience. We will be coming back here again for dinner in the future.', u'SAD - they did not pay taxes\\nREALLY\\n(oh, the state repossessed it btw)\\n(crap)', u\"Didn't like the food. The anticuchos and the lomo doesn't taste not even close to how it really should taste. Oh and gawk your bill, Their menu has one price but their computer charges a higher price. Gratuity is automatically included even though there's option to pick percentage they ring you up with highest percentage. But the food was not good at all. Not even the Rotiserri chicken was flavorful\", u\"Hits the spot if you're looking for that Latin flavor, but it's lacking just that. The flavor was mild, I expected a bang, since most Hispanic food packs a punch with flavor. Not bad, if you're in the area... I wouldn't take a trip out to this place. \\nGood sangria though!\", u\"Dropped in for lunch food was very good but pricey. Staff was friendly but slow. With only two tables in the restaurant service should've been a lot faster. Overall we'll be back.\", u\"So I'm tackling my list of all these great restaurants in NYC. This happened to be on my list for a few years or months. I'm glad I finally went. I love love love ceviche and the ceviche de mixto was excellent. The white sangria was delicious as stated by other reviewers. For the main course I got the jalea (1/2 jalea) and it was delicious. The fried seafood tasted so fresh and delicious. Btw, google maps (if I'm correct) told me to turn on 66th street when the restaurant is actually located in the strip mall by Key Food.\", u\"Food was very good. Although a bit pricey as other patrons have stated. That green sauce is everything and I enjoyed the chicken.  Didn't enjoy having to buy a  side with it though. \\n\\nSangria was delicious. Had the red and white. Both were good.  \\n\\nService was attentive. We got there early afternoon so there are only a few patrons inside. \\n\\nMusic was horrible and became annoying after awhile. There was no variety and after a while it just droned on\", u\"Great place. Quiet atmosphere. Very clean The bar selection is amazing. Speakers in the ceiling that can make the place into a club if you're doing a private party. Try the chicken soup, wow is it good. \\nGiant parking lot, always parking\", u'Great food, hospitality and service. Must have the fried rice, chicken with green sauce and the Tres Leches Guava dessert. As a critic of good food I must also compliment the owners gracious attitude and humble spirit. \\n\\nI\"ll be back,soon!!!', u'After passing this place a few times, always wanting to try it , plus hearing other people rave about Lima & finally stopping in to say hello, I wish I didn\\'t take it TO-GO. \\n\\nThis place has such a nice , cool vibe inside. Kinda small yet vibrant. We were greeted at the host stand with menus in hand. \\n\\nI had the skirt steak which was pretty flavorful with some special marinade , yellow rice which was just rice nothing more , yet still delicious & I ordered a side of Tostonas- which were absolutely delicious. It was a pretty generous portion for being a \"side\". Don\\'t know the names of the accompanied sauces/dips but they were delicious. I didn\\'t try a desert but I will be in the future.  \\n\\nThe bar seemed to be fully stocked , service was great (from what I witnessed). The people that were dining in seemed to be enjoying everything & people kept coming in.', u\"We trecked to Brooklyn to take part in a giant water slide at the Aviator Sports Complex. It was a cold and rainy day and all we could think about was a warm meal. I looked on Yelp for anything that was nearby and would be delicious. I found this place and thought it would work for our party of 5. Upon arriving my hopes quickly went down. This restaurant was located in a shopping center which I'm not a fan of but it was getting late and we were restless and HUNGRY. \\nI am the only Spanish person in my group and although I'm not Peruvian, I am familiar with the cuisine and have eaten it many times before. After ordering pitchers of red sangria, my friends asked for my suggestions and I gave my thoughts. We also asked the waitress and she mentioned a few of the ones I had also picked. Oddly enough when the waitress was talking I realized she could barely pronounce the items on the menu. Maybe she just didn't speak Spanish it wasn't Spanish at all? Either way that doesn't matter just something I noticed. \\nAs we waited for our food and drinks, the waitress brought over some toasted hominy corn with a spicy green sauce. This was so good! I could have eaten the whole bowl by myself. I enjoyed this treat a lot more than just the usual bread brought to tables. \\nThe sangria that finally came was weak. Flavor was lacking and it tasted more like juice with fruit. \\nService was extremely slow despite the fact that we were the only ones there. \\n\\nAppetizers:\\nLima empanadas: filled with spinach, corn, manchengo cheese and figs: these were delicious. The flavors all complimented each other and was a hit with everyone. \\n\\nPapa a la huancaina: boiled potatoes in spicy creamy sauce: a Peruvian staple. They tasted OK. I had asked if they could make Yucca a la huancaina which I prefer, but was told they could not even though yucca is offered on the menu...\\n\\nManchengo croquettes: another hit with our group. Cooked perfectly with just the right amount of crunch and cheesiness. \\n\\nChaufa: fried rice with shrimp. Another popular Peruvian dish. It did not have the presentation I normally see at Peruvian restaurants. The color looked pale (it usually has a brownish color) and as an experienced rice eater (hey I grew up on this stuff!), I could immediately tell I was eating minute rice. Absolutely not acceptable at all. \\n\\nLamb chops: my Canadian friend had these and she loved it. \\n\\nLomo Salteado: beef tenderloin chunks saut\\xe9ed with onions and peppers: again a popular Peruvian dish which I absolute love but the flavors were lacking here. \\n\\nThe chefs need to be retrained in cooking Peruvian good and the service needs to improve. For the amount of time we waited for our food, I could have quickly forgiven them had our food been excellent but sadly it just wasn't.\", u\"This was my first time at Lima and also my first time having Peruvian food. It was absolutely excellent. Every dish I had from the appetizers, main course and dessert were tasty and fresh. The owner Frank was a good host and personally made our San Grias. They were the best San Grias I've ever had and everyone at the table agreed. The place is well designed, clean and feels very homely. I would definitely go there again whenever I'd be in the neighborhood.\", u'Authentic Peruvian Food...Awesome Service...I really enjoy eating at Lima,Though the Place is small I still find it to be very cozy.The first time I had eaten there I wanted to try their Steak so I went for their Churrasco,it was really really good,and the second time I went for the Chicken the pollo saltado.Can t wait to go back and this time I will go for their shrimp and skirt steak my friend went had it and was raving about it.Thank You Lima you are a hidden gem in Brooklyn.', u'\"Sometimes you wanna go, where everybody knows your naaaaame...\", except the owner who greeted us didn\\'t know our names, but still welcomed us like we were his long lost cousins! Heyyyy primo!!!\\n\\nThus charmed, speedily seated, and armed with Yelp knowledge, we went ahead and ordered the sangria, Jalea seafood platter and the fried rice with shrimp. Of course it all came with that delightful greenish sauce, which was the perfect relish for the food.  But Listen Up: I don\\'t know what they\\'re putting in that sangria, but I was giggling after the 3rd sip. I\\'m no lightweight, but hey - strong drinks @ weak prices are A-ok with me!\\n\\nRegarding the food: even though we ordered the half-Jalea, we couldn\\'t finish it all between the two of us. It consisted of a ton of calamari, a good amount of shrimp, some fish, a few baby octopi, and a soft-shell crab. The taste was great, but it would have been nice to have less calamari and more fish or crab; but it was still a solid meal overflowing with deliciousness. We found the fried rice to be a bit too salty, but still flavorful. \\n\\nOverall, we had a great experience - good food, charming and clean surroundings, and a robust sangria. Looking forward to the next time!', u'The waiter was great. I was surprised he was the only one doing the greeting, the food ordering, the serving and everything! As impressive as he was as a waiter, the food was ok. We ordered the empanadas, the fried calamari, the lomo saltado, and the skirt steak. The empanadas had a peculiar taste. The fried calamari was ok but I barely tasted the calamari. The lomo saltado was good as well as the skirt steak. The price was decent, the portion was enough for 3 people. Definitely worth trying.'], u'121.Juliana\\u2019s Pizza': [u\"Okay, being lactose intolerant and all, I already committed to not eating anything here. After seeing 2 huge pizzas arrive at our table, my discipline proved weak. Their crust is divine and held onto the cheese and toppings wonderfully. It's not the most filling pizza, but after going on an all day, self-guided food crawl, this was exactly what we needed.\\n\\nWe had a larger party, which usually sucks at busy places like Juliana's, but it worked to our advantage. We were the only big group, pretty far down the line, so our wait was relatively short. \\n\\nI'd love to come back and try a red sauce pizza, since both our pickings were white (specials 1 and 6). I'll bring my lactase pills next time! Lol.\", u'Thanks for the response and explanation. Considering the fact that I was hung up on 2 times before even speaking to the manager, who abruptly hung up on me as well when my my response to his \"we are very busy, you know\" was \"well I\\'m happy for you\", I\\'m not sure in what version of reality you think i would call back a fourth time to speak with you or anyone else in your facility. \\n\\nYou used the platform of my review to highlight your product and defend your establishment (which, as a business owner I get) , but justifying every turn and shifting the blame isn\\'t an honest approach to what happened in my experience with your staff. \\n\\nI\\'m glad you have such a wonderful product and I wish you continued success, sincerely. However, no part of this experience or your response will inspire me to ever come and find out for myself what all the fuss is about.', u\"3.5 stars\\n\\nThe pies here are ginormous. They're good, especially if you're a fan of the floppy. Tried the margherita pizza with fennel sausage and arugula. I like my pizzas most with unusual toppings and flavors (and less cheese) so while I probably won't be coming back to stand in line, I definitely understand the hype. Just not my personal favorite (although perhaps if I ordered a marinara pizza with roasted peppers / prosciutto  I would feel differently). (Also the line here is noticeably shorter than Grimaldi's and based on reviews / recommendations of friends, Juliana's is the better rendition. Don't get sucked into the wrong line.)\", u\"Juliana's Pizza lives up to the hype. Being a born and raised in Brooklyn you get to know your pizza places very fast. It was the first time visiting Juliana's Pizza. After you walk in to Juliana's Pizza you are greeted with a nice welcome. As we arrived right before the peak of the lunch hour.\\n\\nAfter being seated you drink orders are taken. Our server came over after couple minutes to see if we had any questions on the menu. As we already knew what to order. So we started off with an appetizer. The meatballs with tomato sauce. For the pizza we had Margherita Pizza. \\n\\nIf you are a true pizza lover and never had NY pizza you are in for a real treat. Living on the west coast you really miss NY pizza. On my visit to NY it was a must to have pizza. The meatballs were truly amazing. Very fresh and perfect flavoring. I have to admit it was the best Margherita Pizza I had in town. You can be the judge about the pizza.\\n\\nNo questions the next time I am back in NY I will be visiting Juliana's Pizza. From the minute you arrive to the minute you leave Juliana's Pizza the customer service is first class. If you live or visiting NY Juliana's Pizza is a must.\", u\"Soooo glad I got to try this place out as it was ranked #1 pizza in NY. We had a party of 7 and thought it was going to be a long wait as there was a long line but we were lucky a big table was just leaving. We got sat maybe after 10 minutes and the guy who was helping us was very kind.\\n\\nWe ordered #1 (without the egg) and #6 (the one with guac). So far, it's my favorite place for pizza in New York. It didn't take long for the order to come out after we ordered and both pizzas were super delicious! For the #1 specialty pizza, the bacon was a bit too salty for me but it complimented #6 as that was on the less salty side. However, I still enjoyed #6 much more even though my friend described it as a quesadilla pizza. I think what really made me like the pizza here was their crust. I'm generally a thin crust girl so their crust on their entire pizza was amazing! It was just the right amount of crisp to where it was not a dusty texture and still warm and cheesy. \\n\\nOne day I'll be back to try their desserts because it looked really good but I was so full from eating throughout the day. I'm not sure how it's next to Grimaldi's and both restaurants had lines waiting to get some pizza but if I had to choose, it would definitely be Juliana's. Looking forward to trying their pizza with prosciutto on it as well.\", u\"Excellent pizza bear the brooklyn bridge! You can either wait for Grimaldi's or wait for Juliana's. The Juliana's line is shorter (although barely) and the pizza is very good. Plus they take credit cards. You can either eat at the restaurant or take your pizza to go and eat at brooklyn bridge park. If you take out, make sure you tell the person you want to order to go in order to skip the line. If you want to try classic New York style pizza, you can't go wrong with Juliana's.\", u\"Don't be surprised if there's a line formed outside the restaurant! It's known to always have line because the restaurant itself isn't huge. Don't let that line intimidate you! Make it! The wait wasn't terrible. I think I waited about 20 mins. Few tables outside can be found, although fall has started and I wouldn't recommend to eat there. The pizza is thin crust and may get cold very quickly. It's cozy inside and the staff is lovely. The bathrooms were very clean, which is always a plus. On to the pizza... we ordered two large Margherita pizzas. Enough for four adults. By far one of the best pizzas I've ever had! I wish we had a location in Orlando. The beer was also great (don't remember what it's called) will definitely go back and highly recommend to others.\", u\"I wasn't that impressed by their pizza but maybe because since I don't eat dairy anymore, pizza without cheese is just not as good. Anyway, The line to get in this place gets very long during dinner time. I waited for a table for 6 people for about 30 mins. \\n\\nStarted off dinner with some meatballs. These were really good. Moist and soft and flavorful. Would highly recommend. Then also got spaghetti and meatballs which was a really small portion and the spaghetti tasted like those canned ones. Was not impressed  \\n\\nOn to the pizza. Ordered the marinara which was just sauce on the pizza dough and the margherita pizza and no 4 (tomato, mozzarella, arugula and mozzarella). They sauce was good because it was fragrant and had lots of garlic which I like. However, the crust an dough were such a miss. It was hard, and kind of tasted burnt and I didn't enjoy it too much and we all know pizza is all about the crust!! \\n\\nAnyway, personally to me; this place is a tourist trap in a touristy neighborhood. I will go elsewhere for pizza.\", u\"I was a little iffy about trying out New York pizza because it was quite similar looking to Italian pizza, which i am not a fan of. After watching so many vlogs and reading many reviews, we settled for Juliana's, and boy were we impressed. The pizza here is amazing. It's nice, and fluffy, and crispy. The dough is so good. We ordered a large margaritte pizza, and added sausages. To accompany this meal, we also added a salad. The bill came out to 47$, super pricey, but it was definitely that good. The line is quite long, so I recommend coming on the weekday or off hours.\", u\"I am not the biggest fan of pizza, but the pizza at Juliana's was pretty darn good. Be prepared to wait since this place is popular. My friends and I waited outside for around an hour before we were seated, but looking back, it was worth it.\\n\\nWe ordered 3 pizzas in the smaller size to share for the table: the Margherita, No. 1, and No. 4. I was pleasantly surprised by the Margherita pizza--I didn't know that something so simple could taste so good. The crust was thin and baked to perfection. The No. 1 pizza was good, but it was a little too heavy on cheese for me. No. 4, however, was amazing. The pieces of prosciutto went wonderfully with the bitterness of the arugula, which added a nice freshness to each bite.\\n\\nI forgot that New York was famous for its pizza, and Juliana's was the perfect representation. If the wait wasn't so long, I would definitely be coming here with large parties on a weekly basis.\", u\"This was my local friends recommendation and I had bookmarked this place to try for Pizzas. I am glad my friends could join us and made the evening more memorable. After waiting in a queue for 30 minutes and reaching around 10 pm and getting seated at 10:30 pm we just made it to this amazing place. We were lucky as we were the last to be picked for seating:) as I wouldn't have made it again to this place until I visit NY/Brooklyn again. The place is not very big but they made sure we were comfortable. The menu is not extensive and it is to the point. The service was quick. \\n\\nAbout food -\\nWe had classic 1) Margherita Pizza - Simply delicious. Fresh ingredients, simple and yet so tasty. 2) Marinara pizza with veggie toppings pineapple and mushrooms. 3) Carol's Cannoli - Such fresh and perfect homemade ricotta cheese filling was such a good dessert. \\n\\nIf you can ignore the wait time as they don't take reservations and just for those pizzas and cannoli this place is 5*. Must try if you are looking for authentic and good classic pizzas.\", u'YUMMY \\n\\nYou aren\\'t the best pizza in New York just like that. Clearly this place is doing something right!!! \\nThere can be a lot of wait, so come early and hungry!! \\nHowever, little tip for you or you want to \"skip\" the line... you can just order your pies to go. That\\'s what I did and I was in and out in less than 20 Minutes. And the staff was very nice to me! They gave me a seat and a glass of fresh water. It was lovely. \\n\\nI took my pies home, back in Manhattan, turned on my mini oven, reheated the babies and it was heaven at every bite!! The fun part was the train ride from Brooklyn back to Manhattan with my big pies. The subway car smelled delicious, and by the look of the people around me, I probably could have sold some slices...\\n\\nWe had a classic margherita and a numero 1!', u'Really tasty pizza, great service! Worth the wait in line', u\"Awesome pizza, if not the best I've ever had, but this is solid as far as dedicated NYC pizza shops go.\\n\\nOur group of six waited around 40 minutes for Saturday dinner. The interior is pretty dark (not in an ambience-additive way, more like dingy dark) and cramped, and service can take a while since this place is HOPPIN'. Our waiter was very garrulous and friendly though, and told us several tales about his previous career and his kids and complained the customary New Yorker  complaints about apartment rents.\\n\\nWe ordered the Margherita and Nos. 3, 4, 6. Four pies for six people - *barely* enough if you have several big appetites in your group. Majority favorite was No. 6 with the chicken and guac. I also loved No. 3 with the broccoli rabe and sausage - whatever sausage they used was delicious. Margherita was pretty standard, wouldn't order it again because it didn't add much to the table.\\n\\nPizzas take anywhere from 10-25 minutes each to come out, so don't come in thinking you can dine and dash. Come with a hungry group, wait your 30+ minutes in line, order all the pies you can handle, and leave stuffed and happy.\", u\"Delicious NY pizza, hands down!! I would say that I'm more of a deep dish pizza person than a thin crust guy so I was a little skeptical. Juliana's might have swayed me to the thin crust side!!\\n\\nPeople go crazy for this place. I'd recommend getting there before they open and lining up because if you come a little after they open, you miss the initial wave of people that get seated. We ended up waiting for about 45 minutes but it was sooo worth it. They even have a water jug outside so the humidity isn't killing you while you wait.\\n\\nFor 2 people, we got a large #4, which comes with tomato, mozzarella, arugula and prosciutto. I love simple the ingredients are. The pizza was delicious.. oh my goodness. Even though it was thin, it was chewy and doughy, something I didn't expect. The pizza isn't overly oily and isn't too heavy either. My mouth is just salivating writing this review!!\\n\\nI would definitely make a stop at Juliana's if you're in NY and looking for some terrific pizza. Trust!!\", u\"Pros:\\nAmazing pizza\\nFast service\\nSimple menu\\n\\nCons:\\nNeed a better waiting system \\nWait is ridiculous!! \\nIt's 2017- take a number, send a text when the table is ready \\n\\nI'm all about good food, so naturally when I come to any city, I hop on yelp to see what my fellow yelpers recommend. Given that this place had such a high rating and we were craving pizza, I had to check it out!!\\n\\nFirst attempt was on a Saturday evening at 6pm; the wait was almost 2hrs and people were standing in line for the food. No thanks. I will never wait that long for food, don't care how good it is. Second attempt was a late Sunday brunch around 2pm. The wait was an hour which wasn't as bad as before, so we went for it. We were seated about 30 mins after waiting. Not too shabby! \\n\\nThe food was DELICIOUS ITALIAN, PERFECTION. We ordered the meatballs and Caesar salad, which was plenty to split between 3 people. The meatballs were flavorful and authentic. Juicy and saucy. The salad was not over dressed. And the pizza- man oh man- was it Goooooodd. We ordered the no. 4 and had it doused in truffle oil (after figuring out we could do half and half but it was too late, this was the compromise). It was outstanding!!\\n\\nThe service was quick and the food was delicious but I genuinely can't give 5 stars because of their need for a better waiting system. They really need to get it together to keep people coming back.\", u\"Overall: 3.5/5\\nExpect long lineups, even during off-peak times. We went on a Saturday early evening and the lineup was fairly long.\\nThe pizza is thin crust. Good to try once but I wouldn't come back on a regular basis. Service stands out tho.\\n\\nWhat we ordered:\\n-Margerita pizza\\n-No 1\\n-No 3\\n-No 6\\n\\n\\nFood: 3.5/5\\nWe were all really hungry and the pizza was decent. Good experience, but not something I'd come back for.\\n\\nService: 4/5\\nService was decent. The waiter tried to be humorous, despite spilling water when refilling.\\n\\nValue: 3/5\\nOn the somewhat pricey side ($20/person for just pizza) but not too bad for a hippy gourmet pizza place.\", u\"Brooklyn Pizza!! \\nWow!! Looooong lines for Juliana's Pizza in the raining evening.... We gave up waiting line and takeout Pizza instead!! Since we stayed really close @1 Hotel Brooklyn!! \\nWe takeout Salad and Half Margarita and White pizza with prosciutto!! \\nPizza was pretty good but I wouldn't want to wait over hour for this pizza. I know better pizza places in Japan!!\", u\"Many may think pizzas may taste the same whether it is purchased at a Dominos, Costco, or at a Juliana. Well, that is not the case as your original thoughts on pizza will change when you try Juliana's! \\n\\nAmazing experience that you can share with your friends, family, and loved ones. We walked the Brooklyn Bridge from Lower Manhattan to cross to Brooklyn. Once we were there, it started to heavily pour rain in which we quickly hailed Lyfts to make it. Despite the rain, the line was pretty long. Our party 8 was eventually seated and off we go\\n\\nOrdered \\n- Housemade meatballs (5/5). Beautiful. The sauce was delicious and it is recommended to cut the the meatballs in halves for easy sharing. I cannot imagine how this would taste if made into a spaghetti\\n- Margherita Pizza (4.5/5). Classic tomato, mozzarella and basil style pizza\\n- No. 4 (4.5/5). Amazing pizza with tomato, mozzarella, arugula and prosciutto\\n- No. 6 (5/5). To die for! Toppings consist of grilled chicken with tasty housemade guacamole and cilantro \\n\\nBest Pizza in NYC and one of my favorite dining experiences overall. A must try whenever you're in NYC / Brooklyn\", u'Very good pizza. I got the margarita and added pepperoni and sweet onion to half. Everything was so fresh. The pasta figoli soup was good too. Great customer service here as well.'], u'99.Salem\\u2019s Hour': [u\"What a great neighborhood place!  It started as more of a breakfast/lunch go to and has now transitioned into more like a lunch/dinner + brunch on weekends. \\nSteve, the owner and chef, is a truly conscious human being. He cares about the neighborhood, the planet....and that's reflected in the food he serves. Local, organic and delicious!\\nThe waffles are the best I've ever had in my life (I'll be turning 63 in 11 days). The menu is available all day, so you can get the waffles anytime they're open. \\nAnd, oh yeah, the water. Steve's a righteous dude and spent big bucks to acquire a special water filter that purifies and alkalizes the water. It's the tastiest water you'll ever drink, and it's really really good for you. He cooks with this water, rinses the meat, fruits and veggies. He really cares!\\nStop by, eat some delicious healthy food, have a drink (they've got a liquor license) and talk some music. Steve's also a helluva drummer!\", u\"What can I say! I'm baaaccckkk! After being MIA, off the grid if you will, the enchantress returns! \\n\\nI'm officially a Brooklinite! Living in the city and Queens most of my life, who would've thunk it?!\\n\\nAnyway, enough about me and let's get down to business. This place is legit clean eating, along with your basic yet decent selection of wine, beer and the hard stuff. I had the Albiano, one of two whites on the menu. Smooth medium body finish. Again, they keep it clean up in here. \\n\\nYou must try the meatball entree - it comes with so much hella goodness. Rice and beans, flavorful salad and so much heavenly  \\n\\nService, what can I say! Hot damn! Nicole is a sweetheart.  Mike ensures your glass is never empty. Steve, the owner, and the only chef in the joint, makes you feel right at home. \\n\\nJust had breakfast that's served any time; breakfast sandwich with all the fixins.  That's right, the best meal on the face of this earth any time you desire! Holllaahhhh! Fresh, juicy, moist and delectable. \\n\\nIma be a regular me thinks!\", u'Delicious, healthy food\\nfriendly staff\\nairy space, love the rustic decor\\n\\nThe pancakes and the Cowboy toast were delicious and filling. I love the fact that they serve alkaline water. \\n\\n\\nBottomless brunch is every weekend too!', u'The food here is really good lol I was surprised at the amount of flavor. It\\'s truly nothing fancy but it gets the job done. I also loved that they had milk alternatives for my iced coffee. It seems like a \"locals\" spot (aka neighborhood newbies) but it\\'s cool nonetheless.', u'So great! The bartender was incredible and provided excellent service. We tried the breakfast sandwich, steak protein bowl, omelette, and cowboy toast. All of it was plated beautifully and tasted delicious. The coffee was served in large painted mugs and totally hit the spot. Glad we found this place on yelp during our short time in Brooklyn.', u'The Bigly Omlette was amazing. The blend of coffee was delicious to wash it down \\n\\nCannot wait until deserts are available', u\"Let me tell you about Salem's Hour.\\n\\n1.

I love a good baked wing.\\n6.The ambiance is great.\\n7. Double Happy Hour\\n\\nTo sum it up this is a wonderful place and I will be a life long customer!\", u\"The food was amazing. They offer French press coffee which I highly suggest getting. You'll have a great time at this local spot.\", u\"I live quite close by and was excited to see this addition to the neighborhood. In general it was a good experience but as the place was still quite new I am interested in seeing (as many others mention) how both the menu expands and the hours change when they receive their liquor license. \\n\\nOn the first snowy day of the year, my boyfriend and I made our way to Salem's Hour for a late brunch. The space is intimate and rustic, chic decor. We took our seats at the window, where there's a high table and stools. It was a great place to people watch.\\n\\nWe both ordered cups of black tea, he got the waffle, and I got the huevos rancheros. When asked what the waitress preferred between the waffle and pancake we were told that it's the same batter for both. The tea was fine, nothing crazy, but it came in a nice big mug and the staff wasn't stingy on hot water refills. I will say though, they didn't bring the tea out with any sugar or milk, or even offer it, but brought me honey when I asked. Additionally, it seems there was only one container of honey for the whole restaurant, as partway through our meal our server asked if she could grab our honey for a different table (they might have run out, too, and this didn't disturb my meal but as it gets busier I hope this isn't the case.)\\n\\nWhen we received the waffle, it came in an interesting stone grey color! The plating was nice, the amount of food was above average for the price. It was very pretty but by the looks and taste of it, it was certainly not a typical waffle (with traditional white flour, etc.) You have the option of ordering a gluten free waffle for an extra fee, so I wondered if we were accidentally given the gluten free waffle. When we asked, they explained that the batter is made from a mix of rice, buckwheat, and plain flours, which explains the color and different taste. This waffle tastes more airy with a bit of a grainy texture similar to some wheat pastas. I, myself, am not a fan of buckwheat flour so I wouldn't order this again, but I can definitely see folks really liking it as a healthier option. \\n\\nMy order, the huevos rancheros was better for me. The plate is quite full, everything is salted and seasoned well, and it's worth the extra cost to get the guacamole (which is really good and the amount they give you is pretty OK for the plate but it's only as much as one of those small metal sauce containers that other places might put their ketchup in, so essentially I'm saying there could be more guac involved, but there could always be more guac, right?) I liked that they added bits of fruit into the dish, which isn't the most typical way I've seen the dish presented before, and it added lightness, freshness, and sweetness to the dish. I do wish that there was meat with the dish, or at least the option to have some, but it was good even without it.\\n\\nMiscellaneous: \\nThe bathroom is very clean and comfortable, which is a hidden perk of any restaurant. \\nYou can pay with card or cash but they don't do paper receipts for cards, FYI. \\n\\nUltimately, I must reiterate that this is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. I would definitely come back even if there weren't any changes but I do look forward to seeing how the restaurant grows.\", u'+++\\n- gluten free pancakes should be renamed guilt free pancakes\\n * They are delicious and not as carb heavy\\n\\n++\\n- owner really cares about his product and it shows\\n- shout out to the side salad\\n\\n+\\n- shout out to the food presentation\\n- the quesadilla was good\\n- huevos rancheros was good as well\\n\\n-\\n- I would give five stars, but the waiter put out to-go food on the floor', u\"My brother and I popped in here for some delicious jalape\\xf1o margaritas and awesome baked chicken wings, we'll definitely be back! Unique farm-style/eclectic decor, great music.\", u\"A welcome addition to the neighborhood. I think this was week four that they were open. You could not tell this from how impeccable the attention to detail was. \\n\\nFound them on Yelp. \\n\\nI had the Turkey Bacon and omlette sandwich on nine grain bread with goat cheese. \\n\\nThe place is named after the owner's daughter and it sounds like he plans to expand in due time.  The interior has been decorated with wood from his brother's farm in Virginia along with various metal light pieces and decorations- most notably the giant metal lotus behind the bar. \\n\\nStay tuned for dinner and happy hour after their liquor license clears. \\n\\np.s. we caved and had a pumpkin muffin. So fantastic and it's topped with what seems to be house whipped cream and strawberries. it wasn't too sweet and the spice balance was perfect. \\n\\nWe will absolutely return.\", u\"Came here to have a nice brunch. It was okay. Nothing really special. The service was good. The protein bowl I ordered wasn't what I expected. There was too much going on. There was way too much beans. The salad was okay. Could of added more to it. The French toast tasted too much like egg and wasn't very fluffy. Overall, it was okay. The attire was nice and rustic. The service was good. But the food was just okay.\", u\"This place has food that's much more interesting than he menu suggests! The meatball bowl was absolutely delicious. Nice drinks and a friendly vibe make this a great neighborhood spot.\", u'When Yelp emails me \"suggested hotspots near you\", I normally overlook them. In this case,  I couldn\\'t help but give a hotspot a block away from where I reside I try. Had Sunday lunch/brunch here recently and was pleased with the service. My French vanilla iced coffee was amazing.....not so much my chicken salad sandwich. The onions and scallions took away from the enjoyment and taste of my sandwich. My side of fruit was a bit watery. I must say that the menu is overall very affordable. Don\\'t see myself coming back here, not even for the coffee.', u\"So, on this snow day that we had, I decided to check out Salem's Hour.  I heard a lot of good things about it and figured this would be a good day to try it out.\\n\\nReally loved it, the only thing I regret is that I did not come here sooner.  I had the Bigly Omelette with Steak.  Was delicious.  The cook really gives you more than what I am used to in most of these smaller restaurants.  The price was reasonable, because the food was delicious.  Would definitely go again!\", u'Went to brunch here, very good food and great service/atmosphere. They are still sorting stuff out, as is common for most new restaurants/bars. Seem like good folks all around here! Will return.\\n\\nMy only serious criticism (haha)- the tables are a bit small for food. However, the problem might be my own, as I occasionally forget how to eat/put-glasses-and-forks-down-properly-on-tables/etc.', u\"The French toast  I ordered were very bland and tasted mostly like eggs. There was no fluffiness to it or flavor. The side fruit that was provided is a tiny cup with very watery strawberries and blueberries and wasn't very tasteful. The service was speedy and quick. The place had a rustic feel to it. I just wish the food wasn't so bland.\", u\"Lived on Maple st for one month and found this gem!! It's amazing! Super chill, good food good drinks and chill people.\", u\"Great food, awesome drinks!!! It's good to finally find a restaurant that offers Wholesome food on Nostrand ave.\"], u'79.Della': [u\"Neighborhood gem alert. Staff has an easy disposition, they know their stuff but don't take themselves too seriously all at once.  I only had appetizers here, but I want and will come back for the specials of the day and the entree.

Bread was dry, gnocchi was salty, meatballs dry, liver mousse was nice, but the duck pasta was really nothing special.\\nTiny kitchenette operated only by one cook that was working relentlessly to keep up, and the sweet server was helpless to the situation.\\nThe restaurant was less than half empty..\\nReally dysfunctional and we will never step food there again.\\nAlthough we did not all for it or expected it, they did take responsibility and ducked all the entrees from the bill.\\nNOT recommended', u'We were the first party at 5pm sharp. In contrast to my fellow Yelpers, the service was good. The food was fresh, however, every one of 5 appetizers and main dishes was either under seasoned and/or cold...even the crock of cheesy mashed potatoes, with which were hoping to burn our lips on at that point, was room temperature. \\nI think we went through most of the salt and pepper that we also had to ask for. \\nAt the conclusion of the meal, as we were telling the waitress our disappointment, the table next to us apologized for interrupting but had to agree with everything we said!', u\"This is a really cool place -- romantic, charming and lively.  I was hesitant to come here since they offered a Groupon deal (I've had some bad experiences with restaurants on Groupon) but Della's outperformed all of my anticipated expectations.  The service is amazing!  The waitstaff is very friendly, accommodating and attentive.  The food is absolutely delicious.  It's a cozy small place with a handful of tables.  There is also some outdoor seating.  I highly recommend the duck wings, fried oyster and the pasta of the day, which is homemade.\", u'I\\'m so happy that Della opened in my neighborhood! I\\'ve had nothing but positive experiences here. First of all, the interior of the space is absolutely beautiful. Another review mentions the \"dome\" ceiling, which is really cool and makes it feel like you\\'re dining in a tunnel. The small, intimate booths alongside the bar couldn\\'t be more perfect for a romantic date. The drink menu is clearly designed with care, and the bartenders have also been happy to come up with custom concoctions for us on occasion. The housemade pastas are really nice. And the service is always so friendly here!\\n\\nI especially recommend this restaurant for brunch. I don\\'t like eggs and I don\\'t eat red meat, so it\\'s tough to find a brunch menu that actually has options for me. At Della, I was actually torn between pretty much every thing on the menu - so much seafood! I ended up getting the shrimp boat, while my boyfriend got the salmon cake. We both loved our meals! The shrimp boat was one of the most memorable brunch meals I\\'ve ever had. The home fries were amazing, and I loved the salad that it came with (just the right amount of delicious dressing). I had a bite of the salmon cake, and that was incredible too. The portions were nice & filling. And the brunch cocktails were fantastic. I had the Bloody Murray, and my boyfriend had the Della Playa. Highly recommend both! Can\\'t wait to come back again for brunch!', u\"We finally ate at Della and are so glad we did! The food was delicious. Like it's across-the-street neighbor, Le Paddock, I'm delighted that more upscale, fine dining options (yet reasonably priced!) are coming to this part of Brooklyn. I took off a star because we ordered a bottle of Chardonnay, and they charged us for the most expensive bottle. I've been a server before, and if people order a bottle of wine but don't specify which bottle, you pick one that's average priced. Also, we chose to sit at a table that was half inside, but half outside on a covered porch. I walked out with 2 mosquito bites, but I understand that's tough to manage in the summer. Will definitely be coming back..but will be sure to specify my drink choices!!\", u\"Went on a Sunday night so no issues with the kitchen getting food out. Overall enjoyed the experience. Decent prices and an excellent bottle of wine always helps! My son and I had two pasta dishes: duck ragu and pesto. Pasta tasted homemade. Duck ragu was really good but I must say I was a bit disappointed in the scant amount of duck in the dish. Pesto was fresh and we'll balanced. I tasted my daughter's chicken dish and it was well cooked and we'll seasoned and the sauce was excellent. I tasted the gnocchi and I was not a fan. Not the correct texture for me. The hamachi crudo to start was just ok for me.  Portions are definitely not huge but I think they are not unreasonable.  Our server was timely and pleasant.  If I lived in the neighborhood I would return.\", u\"J-What about the dome place?\\nMe-What?\\nJ-It's a dome. \\nMe-Is that a new type of cuisine?\\nJ-It's Italian but the food is probably better because the ceiling is a dome. \\nMe-We should probably find out.  \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I initially heard of Della when I was browsing Facebook's Kensington group. An article mentioned a few new places in the area, and when it comes to food, we're all up on that scene. \\n\\nThe conversation you read above is the exact conversation we had while walking towards Windsor Terrace around 7 on a Sunday night.  \\n\\nWe arrived to a very friendly staff member who seated us quickly. Our equally friendly waiter came over and shared the specials. Once our order was in and we had a chance to take a look around, we relaxed in our comfy booth closest to the bar. Since our table faced all the other booths at the front of the restaurant, we watched everyone eating and listened to their conversations. Don't lie...you aren't any better than me. \\n\\nMy lady got the handmade pappardelle with duck ragu and I got the short rib. Looking around at the other diners, we noticed that most people chose the pappardelle as well. \\n\\nEvery bite was delicious. The pappardelle was cooked beautifully, the duck was moist, the short rib was flavorful and super tender. I could even hear the people at the other table moaning with pleasure as they complimented each dish. \\n\\nSo I guess my girlfriend was right. Della figured it out. Those dome ceilings must really enhance the flavor of Italian food.\", u'Unreal. Waited 40+ mins for mediocre 16 dollar pesto pasta. Meanwhile, table next to us got royal treatment I guess cuz they knew the owner? Sat after us, got their meal 15 mins before ours, free dessert, etc. Totally fine if you want to give extra attention to regulars, NOT fine to put their order in first and ignore other customers.', u'Went to Della to celebrate a birthday and had a lovely time. The place was empty when we arrived and the service was very attentive. They were able to veganize enough dishes (Bitter Green and Farro Salads, as well as the Roasted Eggplant entree) that I had more than my fill. The food was a little slow to come out, but that suited our style just fine.', u'Amassing food !\\nGreat service !\\nAnd wonderful atmosphere !\\nVery recommended.. definitely will go back there soon .', u\"Had brunch here with a couple of friends. It looks like the perfect neighborhood joint. They did not have lots of options, especially for vegetarians nor did they have interesting sides but their menu is definitely sufficient.\\nThey have a really cute garden area in the back, which is where we sat. The service was very friendly. \\nWe ordered lots of Latke eggs Benedict, the potato pancake was really tasty and crunchy but it was not seasoned at all, with a little extra salt it was yummy. They had a omelette special which was the star of the show, really tasty. It has peppers, spinach and Parmesan. We also had the Challah French toast. It was ok, nothing special. They do not have espresso drinks, their coffee was fine. We also ordered a couple of cocktails, a version of Bloody Mary which was particularly tasty. \\nIt's a nice place to go if you are in the neighborhood\", u\"An ok neighborhood restaurant.\\n\\nOur server was a bit frazzled and we ended up not knowing about the specials and we didn't get the olives that everyone else got to start.\\n\\nWe also asked for a recommendation for a wine and she just pointed out one bottle without any description -- weird for a wine bar.\\n\\nWe shared the bitter greens salad, which was not bitter at all (luckily for me). We also had a pasta each. The puttanesca was a touch overcooked, but the fettucine was good and full of flavor. We were both still hungry after the salad and pasta, so we added the pork loin. The pork was seasoned well but was a bit overcooked too.\\n\\nOverall, the service is spotty, but it's ok for a neighborhood restaurant.\", u\"Fantastic! My son said his skirt steak was the best meat he ever ate. I drank the hellblazer- just beautiful. The pasta was done perfectly al dente. The service was attentive, and they took care of my other son's dish (he changed his mind) quickly. I'm so psyched this place is in the neighborhood.\", u'My daughter and her family live close by and this is one of their favorites of the local restaurants, and I can see why.\\nFrom the outside it looks tiny with a very narrow facade. Inside is surprisingly roomy with a long main dining area followed by an enclosed terrace and then an open garden with picnic table seating.\\nThe menu features a wide variety of unusual dishes prepared with ancient grains and fresh vegetables.\\nI started with \"Bagna Cauda\" which consisted of crushed anchovies in a bowl of warm olive oil with crusty country bread and raw vegetables for dipping. I followed up with a dish of beef short ribs on a bed of beans which sounds banal but it was very nicely flavored with an unusual variety of spices. \\nAll in all a nice discovery.', u\"Came here for dinner with a friend the other night and the quality of the food seems to have gone downhill a bit.  It's been a few months since my last visit and I ordered the duck ragu parpardelle which I've had before and loved.  This time the pasta tasted like it hadn't been cooked and I was eating raw sheets of dough.  I know pasta should be al dente but this was a bit too raw and all I could taste was flour since the duck and sauce flavors were barely there.  My friend had the short rib which was tasty and hence the 3 star review.  \\nI had such hopes for Della and would try it again, but the pasta was really a let down.\", u'Went here because the place across the street, Le Paddock, was too crowded. This place was also packed - it was a Saturday night around 7:30. The service was slow and one server made a few mistakes. They brought us waters with no ice on a warm summer night. They brought ice when we asked, but that took another ten minutes. It took an extremely long time to get our food. You can see in the open kitchen, the two chefs were cooking on hot plates. Without a full kitchen and with such a varied menu, it is hard to get food out quickly. We thought the food itself tasted pretty good and we want to give props to the chefs for working their assess off and producing good food in such conditions. This place could be really great if they get some streamlining systems in place.', u\"I didn't have a good start for this place. Putting a reservation down for a date night a week before coming, I was asked to seat at the bar for a table to open up. Beside asking for a quiet table on my reservation, I was given a table next to the kitchen and their work station. It's really unfortunate that they take reservation however never follow up with request.\\n\\nDrinks are decently priced but really mediocre. We were looking forward for the fried oyster however they ran out. If you are looking to try something specific, do call ahead I guess. They have a few dinner special introduced by a happy waiter which is really nice. We went along with a few special without being pressured of course.\\n\\nI would say the portion is pretty generous. I had their seafood plate and you can really share that among 2 light eaters. In term of ordering, I would go for 1 app, 1 entree and maybe maybe 1 pasta homemade. With 2 drink, that will set you back around $80. In the city, you can't really do that. Food quality is definitely fresh and delicious. \\n\\nI really hope this place will do well however please step up on your commitment.\", u'My favorite items were the pasta.  A sweet little place with nice ambiance.   Fast service and a good neighborhood vibe.', u'Went there for first time last night March 2017. Had heard good things. Good food. Before 8pm on a Saturday, they were out of lots of food and drink items that were basics on the menu. Service was really bad. People next to us had been there for almost 3 hours without getting dessert. If they can get their act together, it would be a good addition to the neighborhood. No plans to go back.'], u'167.Don Chingon': [u\"Elotes, elotes, elotes. You could probably come here and just eat 15 of these and die happy. \\nWhat an awesome local spot. Came on a Thursday night, waited about 5 minutes for a menu. They are super busy and could use more wait staff- this is in no way a knock to the current servers though, ours was friendly and attentive as he raced from table to table.\\n\\n-Do not not leave without having the delicious, salty, flavor packed amazingness that is the elote. Grilled perfectly, plated cool with the husk. Tastes even better than it looks. Even if you are on a date, you won't even feel the slightest bit hesitant picking this up and going to town...AND licking the plate clean.  \\nCarnitas tacos: juicy pork, sweet and tangy salsa and pickled onion, awesome flavors, would get again for sure.\\nCarne asada tacos: moist too, similar awesome flavor as the carnitas. I came back again one night and ordered the carne asada platos by mistake. It is delicious too, but there's a greater flavor profile (avocado, pineapple) if you get it in the tacos version. \\nLast but not least...mmmmm, beans.\", u'Wow. The food here is amazing. I was pleasantly surprised. The space is a bit small so you wanna get in early in a busy night (maybe call ahead?). I had chicken tacos, jalape\\xf1o poppers and queso dip and the food came out speedily and was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place. \\n\\nThe pricing, I think was fair.', u\"I've been on the hunt to find phenomenal Mexican food in Brooklyn and I finally found it, Don Chingon is SO good!\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I stopped here on a late Friday night for drinks but we also ended up ordering some food. He had the chicken burrito, it was great. I got the corn to start and chicken tacos for my main. They also don't skimp on servings, we were pretty stuffed after. \\n\\nWhat I loved about this place was that nothing was bland, the food had so much flavor--you could taste every single thing in food. So good, can't wait to go back. If you haven't been, must try!!!\", u\"Surprisingly really good.  It's kind of amazing how many places can't make a good quesadilla.  Don Chingon makes a great one - particularly their chorizo one, it comes together in a salty, fatty, greasy mess of deliciousness. The drinks are great and everything was reasonably priced.  A good place for pre/post Barclays.\", u'Came here with my friends & the food was veryyy good and flavorful. Everything had seasoning in it and it was very hot and fresh. The waiters were always asking if we were okay & filling up our water cups promptly. We came in around 10 and stayed until closing but no one rushed us to leave. Simple menu but the sizing of each plate will get you very full. Nice atmosphere too :)', u\"I am VERY satisfied with Don Chingon & here's why. \\n\\nWe went to Barclay Centre to see The Weeknd on a Tuesday so naturally I had to find the good eats in the vicinity. \\n\\nTex Amex for two latinos sounds perfect. We walked in for happy hour $7 Margaritas (they're $5 on the Island) but I'm not complaining. They were easy to drink and deff hit the spot.\\n\\nThe server was fantastic. She was nice and smiled and offered us all the promotions for the hour. There was a hair in a Margarita (woah) and they comped it. \\n\\nWe both ended up ordering steak burritos medium cooked. Portion was perfect. Came with rice, beans, sour cream, spicy salsa (yum!) and a scoop of guac. Such a pile it yourself burrito but it was damn GOOD. \\n\\nThe place was flooded with people seeing the concert and you can easily see why. The food is delish! I would come back for any other event I attend at Barclay!\", u\"Came here just for drinks and guac & chips. I had a Dos Equis and my friend had a margarita which she liked. The guac was creamy and the amount they give you is quite generous. There are pomegranate seeds and I think maybe grapes (?), but it was something sweet that gives the guac more depth and flavor. Also ended up getting elote and it was delicious. You can ask for it off the cob so it's more convenient to eat. It's flavorful, sweet, and cheesy. \\n\\nAlso, service is good and interior is spacious. \\n\\nWill definitely be back to try their food.\", u\"It was a really busy night when I went here. I went for a quick dinner before a Barclay's Center concert with family. The wait was insanely long for 4 people, as they have very little seating!! We waited for about an hour but the food was definitely worth it. The chicken quesadilla was amazing and their guacamole & salsa is great too. It's a great little spot for dinner before a concert or if you're around Flatbush Ave looking for a good place to eat.\", u'It\\'s small size makes it much more intimate and cozy compared to other Mexican restaurants. It\\'s definitely a lot more down to earth, there aren\\'t flashy gimmicks or loud music playing like other joints. The staff was very friendly and our waiter checked on us the perfect amount of times. \\n\\nI loved the wallpaper designs in the dining area and in the restroom. The name of the restaurant \"Don Chingon\" was labeled over the eyes of the western looking models on the wallpaper. \\n\\nBooth seating is limited, but there is plenty of seating and seats at the bar available.\\n\\nThe jalape\\xf1o poppers were UNBELIEVABLE!! It had just the right amount of spice and was so juicy! Definitely a recipe for the books!! For my entree I got the chicken quesadilla and it was one of the best I\\'ve ever had!!! It came with delicious rice, beans, sides of guac & sour cream and pico de gallo! Very filling and very yummy!! \\n\\nThe happy hour prices cater only two cocktails and a few beers, I was a bit bummed that the Paloma wasn\\'t a part of the happy hour but I ordered it anyways. The lime juice overpowered the grapefruit but nonetheless was still satisfying!', u\"This place is amazing. Every time I come here I try something new and I still haven't found a favorite dish. Even if you're just stopping in for drinks, at least try the guacamole. It's made with grapes! I've never seen guac with grapes before coming here for the first time but it's actually really good. I enjoy stopping in whenever I'm in the area.\", u\"Just steps away from Barclays Center, this is a great place to visit whether you're in a rush trying to get to a game or would like to take your time and hangout.\\n\\nThe staff was fast and friendly. We were in-and-out in 30 minutes. The food was amazing. I had the Carne Asada taco plate - the steak was juicy AND the taco shells did not fall apart. I call that a win!\", u\"Someone recently told me that burritos are an American invention, and not Mexican. My worldview was irreparably changed since then.\\n\\nI guess by that token, Don Chingon isn't strictly Mexican. Because they serve burritos, and a damn good one. No, really, try the chorizo burrito. So good.\\n\\nThe Tex-Mex tagging on Yelp is pretty accurate, because they also do things like jalapeno poppers (which are among the best I've ever had). They also like using tempura in their breading, so... Tex-Mex-Japanese? Who knows.\\n\\nSpeaking of tempura, I had the tempura fried pollack tacos, which were also damn good. With a side of fluffy rice and black beans. Pretty good amount of food for $15.\\n\\nPrices for most of the entrees were reasonable, but they charge $11 for chips and guac (which is what an entire meal at Nacho Macho costs), so...\\n\\nAnyway, love the decor, especially the wallpaper.\", u'Awesome food and nice, chill atmosphere. Worth a trip over to Brooklyn for this place.', u'This place is right up my alley.  Its in a good location, nice spacing, good seating and helpful service.\\n\\nThe food was very tastey and the guac with pomegranate seed and grapes was eye opening and soooo good I was happily surprised!!!  So far I have come alone, with the girls and date night each time was very good no problem and service was quick.  \\n\\nOf course I will be back keep of the delicious work!!!', u\"So happy I finally came here! My friends and I came on a Friday night, when we first got there it was packed and seating is kinda limited, but we were able to grab a couple of seats by the bar and have a cocktail. We waited about a half hour for a table. The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is fun, definitely a good place to go for dinner and drinks. \\nAs appetizers we tried the guac and the salsa sampler. The guac was seasoned really good, but it had pomegranate seeds and green grapes in it which I didn't like too much, it kinda threw me off. Each salsa was really good, and the chips they give with the guac and salas were also good. As entrees we all got a quesadilla. We tried the chicken and the steak ones, which both were both tasty, and they serve their quesadillas with a side of rice and beans which is always a plus! The margaritas, frozen or rocks were also delicious. I'll definitely come to Don Chingon again\", u'The food was fine. Nothing special. There was also not much for vegetarians which is disappointing because Mexican cuisine is my go to for \"ethnic\" veggie food', u'Great Mexican food- very filling and delicious\\n& service was good- server was very friendly\\nLocated at a prime location- only a few blocks from Barclays Center', u\"I'd always assumed that having no soul was a bad thing. A very Linda-Blair-head-spinning-360 degrees-worthy bad thing.  Am not so sure anymore after eating here.  You see, I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but something about this place felt very corporate and soulless. This includes the food, and yet, I found most of it deliciously compelling:\\n\\nGuac & Chips ($11):  I am a fan of zesty guac, made with plenty of white onion, tomato, cilantro, lime, and fresh chili peppers.  This was not that. But the addition of sliced grapes and a sprinkling of pomegranate arils added a fruity burst of sweetness that grew on me.  This was served with warm corn chips which should be a thing everywhere if you ask me.\\n\\nJalapeno Poppers ($4):  Four jalapeno halves were filled with an herby, cheesy aioli and then lightly fried, tempura-style.   Yeah, tempura...  Not exactly Tex-Mex, but it works.  LOVED this!!!\\n\\nElotes aka Mexican Street Corn ($4):  Another big winner.  Grilling, plus crema, cotija cheese, & chili powder works magic, even, apparently, on winter corn.  The kitchen thoughtfully cut this into thirds for us to make it easily shareable which was very much appreciated.\\n\\nTacos:  This is where the formulaic aura of the food started to kick in for me.  The best tacos are made with one intangible ingredient that was sorely lacking here: LOVE.  Other than this, they were, admittedly, enjoyable; just my least favorite part of the meal.  Other thing is, you cannot mix 'n match fillings so we ordered 3 different, individual Taco platters to share, including Fried Avocado, Chicken, & Carne Asada. The latter was the priciest @ $16.\\n\\nA word on Happy Hour:  HH runs until 6 and includes both regular & Sweet 'n Spicy Margaritas for $7.  Imo, the regular Margaritas could be stronger & less sweet.  Fine for HH, but I'd be p.o.'ed for the non-HH price of $11.  If memory serves, Beer plus a Tequila shot runs $6 during HH.  I wound up swiping hubby's shot to supplement my totally non-buzz inducing Margarita.:)\", u'We came on a Sunday for lunch, right when they opened. Me, spousey and 5 year old in tow. The place was empty. We ordered two margaritas--a house for hubs and a \"dulce y caliente\" for me. Both were delicious, and they sneak up on you in the best way. They made a virgin margarita for HRH, with a sugared rim. She was in heaven. For apps, we had queso and guac. I\\'m not into cheese, but man, that quest was yum. I was scooping jalape\\xf1os out the bottom. And the guacamole was good, too. I love the pomegranate arils but could have omitted the grapes. I might have been more of a fan If there was more spice to go with the sweet. But, alas, I gave up on spicy shared dishes when I had a kid. It\\'s the price you pay. By the time lunch came, we weren\\'t very hungry. But we hate to let the food win, so we gave it our best. Hubby had carnitas tacos, which he really liked. I took the server\\'s advice and ordered the vegetarian papas y rajas burrito over the avocado tacos. I wish I\\'d tried the tacos! The burrito was good to great. I thought the potato pieces were a little too big--they ended up tasting underseasoned because of the size of the potatoes. They were still good. What I really loved on my plate was the black beans. I wish o could make them at home like this--perfect texture, a little salty/smoky. So good. And for my vegetarian daughter, they happily made a plain cheese quesadilla. We did our best, but still couldn\\'t clear our plates. Two tables stood up and left as we were waiting/eating. It seems they were in a hurry and thought they\\'d wandered into a chipotle. I found the service to be prompt and efficient. Our server was also tending bar, but I thought he did a great job. He even brought us two glasses of \"holy water\" (house tequila) with our bill and explained that it comes from the same distillery as their high end stuff. I\\'d definitely come back here when we\\'re in the neighborhood again!', u'Amazing place. I had the tempura avocado and fish tacos that came with rice and beans. I wish it came with more rice and beans but it was a decent size I was just being greedy. Also got this groovy drink that came with an jalape\\xf1o Garnish. When you put it in the drink to set for a minute the flavor of the jalape\\xf1o makes the drink.'], u'59.Ends Meat': [u\"Went to get the chicken cutlet. I had been passing by for weeks now and finally decided to give it a go. \\n\\n\\n\\nMan, that chicken will fill you up quick fast and in a hurry. Its very tasty and the bread is crisp. That's all there is to it. I will return when the need for some real good chicken cutlet arises.\", u\"I love the concept of this place - waste not, want not.  I'm very happy to say I love the execution.  I was extraordinarily pleased with my sandwich - I had the hogfather (a wonderful blend of Pancetta, Fincolilina, provolone, lettuce and mayo with a perfectly crusty bread) and really liked it.  I will certainly have one again and there dry meats are exceptional - its antipasto time!\", u\"Hell yeah! AWESOME sandwiches at a fair price for this market! I love a place that has different cuts and products and has someone knowledgeable behind the counter. It just so happened that I ran into the owner who'm i've bumped into years ago while his Charcuterie CSA was just starting off. If you see this place I recommend you stop and order some food.\", u'Came here on a busy Sunday afternoon. Unfortunately, we were told by the staff that they had forgotten to pick up fresh bread for the day so they could not serve any of their sandwiches. Aside from that, great staff and even better food! Tried their steak and left impressed. Very juicy!', u\"So I'm loving this place! Such cool people greeting you and educating you on their curing process. I like their Coppa, Lomo, Saucisson Sec, and Nduja. They have dry aged steaks. They serve hot foot as well. The products that they sell are grass fed and are from local farms. They also sell dog bones. How clever! Can't wait to to sample these meats with the wines I just bought!\", u\"I've never been disappointed here. Food is Delicious, employees are helpful and friendly. Often times you can watch the butcher's working while waiting for your order. They really go above and beyond with the service. I eat here pretty often. Be warned... they use a lot of mustard, mustard seed. Not a bad thing for me but some may not like it.\", u\"These folks are doing such good work. Hogfather sandwich was sublime. I fear that my diet which has leaned towards less and less meat over the past 10 years may be reversing coarse due to their brilliance. One of the great pleasures of Industry City has been all the conversations with makers, hearing of their passion and curiosity and the depth of their craft. All that goes for the people at Ends Meat - do yourself a favor and ask lots of questions if you're curious - they'll tell you all about what they do, and what they do is a lot.\\nthank you Ends Meat!\", u\"I'm writing a review after having had only one sandwich from the place, but that sandwich was so good I'm inspired to write a review about it. It was the pate and bacon sandwich, and it was killer. It wasn't huge or overspilling but it was very rich and delicious. It may be a little too rich for some people, but I like rich, and it had kimchi on it that offset the richness perfectly. I also sampled the chorizo which, for chorizo fans, you might want to check this one out--the best I've ever had. \\nThis sandwich wasn't cheap, but I considered it money well spent. It was that good.\", u'Industry city is a great place to explore for the day or to take a quick trip for wine, chocolate and any of the delicious food options that are available. With that said, if you go to industry city and for some reason you do not visit Ends Meat then your trip (day, life, etc.) is incomplete. \\n\\nEnds Meat is an impressive butcher shop in which every morsel of food is delicious and all of the aged meats, sausages and charcuterie demand your attention. My husband and I have visited twice so far and we\\'re blown away both times. \\n\\nFirst trip: The Hogfather (with the optional Nduja- a spicy spreadable sausage) The aromas of provolone and a variety of their housemade meats were perfectly held together in a ciabatta style roll. So yummy. \\n\\nSecond trip: Their NY dry aged steak burger with the works (cheddar and house made bacon). Totally delicious and unlike any other common place burger. The juiciness of the meat was reminiscent of eating high quality steak. The second item we ordered was their hotdog, served with caramelized onions and crispy fried onions. I said I \"wasn\\'t hungry\" and would need to share it--once I took a bite there wasn\\'t much sharing needed. (Only $5 for the hotdog!) \\n\\nEverything is made in house and I can\\'t wait to try a new delicious option every time we visit. A must visit!', u\"New York has everything you want to eat. Brooklyn? Even more.\\nBut some days I miss the taste of the authentic Tuscan cured meats I have grown up with. \\nNot saying that these guys' meats have that Tuscan taste, no. But they do have great quality. I tasted different types of meats they cure, all were so good. \\nPat was also so kind and professional.\\nYou are my destination now when I have that nostalgic feeling!\", u\"Small, family owned, and unique! \\nI love this place. It has tasty sandwiches, friendly staff and a great selection of antibiotic free, local farm fresh meats...what's not to love!\", u'As a former vegetarian & someone that cares for the health of their family ... this is the best meat to eat if you are going to eat any . Like they say , happy animals make better tasting meat . I shop from their take home meat selections & have never been disappointed - they are Renaissance men , not butchers .', u'These guys are the best-\\nThey make all the salumi from scratch, and right before your eyes. The workspace is small so you are probably going to get to see them in some stage of meat artistry while you wait for your lunch or salumi order. They usually have some beautiful cut of beef, pork, or chicken you can bring home for dinner. You can tell everybody there is really knowledgeable, and cares about the products they make and sell.\\nGet there early before he lunch special sells out.', u\"So difficult to find good 'charcuterie' in the US. Being French/Italian I am a very picky eater and it is frequent to find processed sausages, saucissons in most of the supermarkets/delis. At ends meat they produce amazing charcuterie with local meat! Really impressed! Can't wait to try their meats and sausages!!\", u\"Soooooo good. The Beef neck sandwich was delicious. I'm planning on having the meatball sandwich next time. The staff was friendly and helpful about describing the sandwiches and recommending what to order. I like that everything is out in the open so you can see them prepare it and see that everything is clean.\", u\"I just had a Hogfather sandwich. Truly exceptional. \\n\\nNice people too.\\n\\nI can't wait to try everything else on the menu...\", u\"Ran into this place while shopping around the corner. They have a regular sandwich menu and a second menu that changes daily. Everyone was genuinely nice and enjoys what they do. Made from local sustainable meat which is cool but more importantly, its affordable. \\nThe sandwiches are amazing and delectable. I also saw some pickled goodies that I'll probably pick up next time. If your in the mood for home made meat sandwiches, head here. You won't be disappointed.\", u\"The sandwiches weren't amazing, but just ok. The pigstrami was my favorite out of the ones we tried. The muffaleta was pre-made and kind of stale. Not worth a special trip, but ok if you're in the neighborhood.\", u'Take all of the best aspects of recent food movements, throw em in a food processor, and you end up with Ends Meat. You want locally sourced and farm-to-table? You got it. I can even tell you which farm they get their cows from. You want someone who cares about their craft? John butchers and cures his meats on site. You want paleo? Doesn\\'t get more paleo than huge slabs of meat. You want vegan? Well, okay... maybe you can\\'t have that.\\n\\nEnds Meat has been on my radar for quite some time. My friends used to do the charcuterie club from John, and I had my first taste at Pig Island, where they made pork nuggets, brats, and brought along some delicious \\'nduja. It was definitely the longest line, and with good reason!\\n\\nNow, they have a storefront at the Industry City food hall. They serve well-crafted sandwiches (with both meat and veggie options) at very reasonable prices, especially considering how much food you get.\\n\\nI was lucky enough to try all of their non-vegetarian sandwiches - the Pigstrami, the chicken chorizo, and the chopped cheesesteak. They were all really, really delicious. My favorite was the chicken chorizo, which came with avocado, black bean spread and pickled red onions. Basically a bunch of my favorite sandwich ingredients. The Pigstrami was also tasty, with heaping piles of pastrami, topped with Swiss and pickle slaw. And lastly, I also liked the chopped cheesesteak, although it wasn\\'t what I expected. It wasn\\'t a traditional cheesesteak, and came on ciabatta bread, but had the typical toppings - provolone, peppers and onions. The steak was also more of a stewed consistency rather than chips. Once you get past that, it\\'s a very good sandwich. Just calibrate your expectations accordingly! I like that they toast all the sandwiches before handing them over. It may take an extra 30 seconds, but trust me, patience is a virtue!\\n\\nWe also had the chance to try some of their sides. The specials of the day were beets and zucchini with almonds (which was all kinds of refreshing) and a black bean salad with kale and feta (a bit heavier, but a great mix of fall flavors).\\n\\nOh, and they also have soup. They\\'re really going over the top with their food options, but somehow they do it all very well. Their soups du jour were beef lentil and creamy mushroom. The mushroom was probably one of the best soups I\\'ve ever had in recent memory. Great flavors and seasoning, and something that\\'ll be great to warm yourself up on a winter day.\\n\\nOf course, there\\'s also the charcuterie that started it all. Like the lunch menu, there\\'s an extensive selection available. The coppa was amazing, and the two sausages I tried were great (the chorizo seco and the saucisson sec). You can tell that there was a lot of thought and effort put into curing and maintaining everything.\\n\\nI also can\\'t say enough good things about John, the owner. He\\'s one of the nicest guys in the world and incredibly humble. Come in when it\\'s not the lunch rush, and he\\'ll be happy to have a conversation about anything and everything.\\n\\nI would be remiss if I didn\\'t mention their new meat club (http://www.endsmeatnyc.com/meat-club). We immediately signed up for the half share option and just picked up our meat in Park Slope. I\\'ll be back with an update on how everything was!\\n\\nJohn also told us that they\\'re also going to start opening on weekends on Smorgasborg (Saturdays at first, starting on 10/17!)\\n\\nP.S. It took me entirely too long to get the pun of the name \"Ends Meat\". I may be stupid.', u\"YUM, we went over to Industry City on a Saturday to check out the Flea, and I was HUNG OVER and I wanted a meatball sandwich.  Sadly a lot of venues in IC were closed on Saturday, but Ends Meat was open and it was great.  The interior and vibe was so honest and natural and you could tell the guy who owns and runs it loves what he he does.  This is even more apparent in the quality of his food, all of which he is passionate about giving you something good, wholesome, and different.  The meatball sub was delicious - every part of it - the cheese, bread and meat.  I'm a huge fan.\"], u'153.Ramen Zamurai - Williamsburg': [u\"Stumbled into this cute little ramen shop in Williamsburg since my friend and I were looking for a place to eat close by. This hidden gem is exactly the type of place I love since atmosphere and food was amazing. My friend and I decided to share an appetizer of kara age (fried chicken). Maybe we were really hungry but we finished this within seconds.. \\n\\nNext came our tonkatsu ramen. The broth was so flavor and not too salty. The chasiu was tender and meaty, while they kept the rest of the bowl with the simple toppings (scallion, egg, bamboo shoot, etc.) The best part was the noodles since it was cooked perfectly without tough chewy pieces to it. I'll definitely be back soon!! \\n\\nOne thing to note.. this place is cash only, so be prayers to bring them bills out :)\", u\"On my quest to find the best bowl of ramen, I checked out this place with a friend at her suggestion after a magazine launch which brought me east of the east river. \\n\\nThe people working here are actually Japanese which I feel like is almost uncommon. My friend greeted the hostess in Japanese and requested a table then later told me the last time she did that at a different ramen place they asked her to speak English. \\n\\n I got the samurai shoyu while my friend got the vegetarian option. The way part of the ramen for me were the noodles. They were an excellent consistency and chewy. I finished my whole bowl! The pork was quite small and not the typical melt in your mouth pork that comes with the best ramens. The friend said that the veggie was pretty bland and that the broth was more like hot water. \\n\\nIve definitely had better but I've also definitely had worse. I enjoyed the atmosphere and having the kitchen right next to the dining area. Yelpers get 10% off before checking in which we forgot about when the bill came. Also it is important to note this place is cash only.\", u\"tldr: Everything but the veggie miso is delicious.\\n\\nI live in the neighborhood and went to try out this new restaurant about a week ago with my roommate and boyfriend.\\nI got the veggie miso with poached egg and extra spicy oil as well as the chasu don.\\nMy boyfriend had the Samurai Shoyu and Sapporo.\\nMy roommate also had the veggie miso with gluten free noodles and Izeko Sparkling Jelly Sake.\\n\\n\\nPros: \\nDark lighting\\nOk customer service\\nGood wait time for food\\nGreat music\\nAffordable prices\\n\\nCons: \\n$3 ATM Fee\\nCash only\\nExtremely salty veggie miso\\n\\n\\n\\nI had been craving ramen for a few days before coming to this restaurant. I was thoroughly disappointed when I couldn't enjoy my ramen due to my extremely salty broth and some tasteless veggie noodles. \\nI expected regular carb-filled noodles. Instead, as an unpleasant surprise, I received some tasteless vegetable-based noodles. I would have appreciated if the waiter had at least said the noodles were different from every other dish on the menu.\\nThe broth was salty, which I suspect is due to the soy sauce in the noodles. Soy sauce itself is extremely briny so there is no need to add extra salt onto the dish. \\n\\nHowever, my chasu don was extremely flavorful and my poached egg was perfectly cooked. I tried a bite of both my roommate and my boyfriend's noodles and they were delicious, which only made me feel more bitter of my own unpalatable dish lol. \\nThe sparkling sake was a little too sweet for my taste but my roommate loved it. Both drinks were served immediately. \\n\\nI didn't tell the server that I didn't enjoy my noodles until after finishing the chasu don, but was told that I should have told him after the first bite, even though I had only taken a few bites of my veggie miso and my bowl was filled to the brim. There were only two other customers, yet the server didn't come around once to ask if the food tasted alright. \\n\\nAll in all, I was disappointed since I am vegetarian and could only order the veggie miso. Not returning anytime soon, unless I'm craving ramen and am already in walking distance to this restaurant. If so, I might try the veggie miso with potato noodles. \\nIf you are craving some delicious ramen and aren't a vegetarian, then this restaurant would be perfect for you.\", u\"My fianc\\xe9 and I continued on our journey of finding really good ramen places in NYC. He happened to find this one on - you guessed it. While walking in, we realized it was a cash-only joint. Luckily, there's an ATM right by the entrance. After withdrawing some dough, we were immediately greeted and seated by a cheerful Japanese hostess. The atmosphere is super chill and cozy. We both ordered the Samurai Tonkotsu. The pork broth was not as rich and savory as some other ramen places, and the egg didn't have that satisfying gooeyness that I'd hoped for. The deliciously marinated braised pork belly did melt in my mouth, however. And the noodles were perfectly al dente. Although the eating experience was delightful, the restaurant was a little TOO warm; every time I slurped on them noodles, a bead of sweat would come rolling down my sideburns.\", u\"I love their cuisine and environment, it's been one of my favorite spots for years now. Their so fresh martini is always delicious along with majority of their dishes.\", u\"Classic izakaya/ramen joint feel inside, with really kind employees, but the ramen wasn't great and it's cash only. Ordered the tonkotsu - the broth wasn't as flavorful and rich as a lot of other ramen I've had in Midtown. The noodles also weren't stellar (slightly funny texture, something seemed off with them but I can't quite place it), and the other toppings weren't very generous (not many bamboo shoots and a very thin shaving of pork). The egg however was excellent. If I was starving and wanted a relatively cheap meal, I might come back, but I'd rather trek into the city for the real stuff.\", u'Food was great. We ordered the spicy miso ramen and the veggie miso ramen. They were both delicious. Service was attentive. The only downside was the AC was broken today. \\nTip: get the Ikezo sparkling jelly sake for something new and fun.', u\"CASH ONLY and ATM charges $3 fee\\n\\nTl;dr Ramen not great ($12) and pork bun ($4) not worth it. Also, it's really really hot in there. I dunno what's up with their air conditioning. \\n\\nDisclaimer: I really like ramen so I might be harsh here. However, after reading the other reviews I was excited to try this new place. Honestly, we must have gotten different chefs or something because boy was this a disappointment. \\n\\nNoodles: In my mind, noodles should be cooked all the way through. I found clumps of noodles stuck together in my bowl very clearly undercooked. Like, this is a ramen place. At least make sure your noodles are up to scratch. \\n\\nBroth: I had the tonkotsu, a standard ramen choice. This broth was mediocre at best, bland even. \\n\\nChashu: Really subpar is all I can say.\\n\\nPork bun: Again, subpar chashu, but this bun was served with mayo, lettuce, and, get this, a slice of tomato. I guess they were going for some fusion pork bun / slider?? Not my cup of tea. \\n\\n\\nService: Our waitress was nice and smiley, but forgot my glass of Sapporo and then almost double charged for it when we reminded her of it. Food took frankly way too long to arrive considering that the place was not even half full when we visited. \\n\\n\\nOverall, would not come back.. Hope this was just a bad night for them because this ramen really just made me sad lol\", u'\"Good taste, great value, good service and a nice setting - Like in Japan\"\\nAtmosphere: This casual place is a bit of a time machine. The Japanese greetings and attention give you a peaceful feeling.\\nGourmet: Besides their original ramen they offer the classics ramen .on your table add to the experience in this almost authentic Japanese ramen place. (I like spicy miso.)Beer is also available.\\nService: Very alert, patient and attentive. Great.\\nConclusion: If you miss Japan or are up for something different this is the place to be. Probably the best ramen in NYC in this price range.', u\"where to start...the broth, oily and lacked flavor. Wish i could say that it was salty or heavy handed in soy sauce but it was just flavored w pork fat and scallion bits & the saddest looking bamboo shoots. The noodles were semi hard, waxy and oily, the pork wasn't even tender & was 70/30 fat to meat ratio. Stay away from the gyoza. It's not hard to pan fry to get a decent consistency of browning throughout but they somehow f'd that up as well. The texture was like chewing dried elmers glue brushed in oil and stuffed w/ Trader Joe meatballs. Take the L 1 stop into the city and hit up Kambi or the way to Lorimer and go to Suzume. THIS PLACE IS GARBAGE\", u\"Pretty good. The staff is really nice. Ordered the Tonkatsu which had amazing noodles but the broth was way too oily for me. The boiled egg though was perfect and the pork was too. I've been here twice before - it's a good spot to grab a quick dinner. But beware, this place is cash only.\", u'Staff was super nice and polite! I ordered the samurai shoyu and it was delicious. Would come again!', u'Really enjoyed this ramen. The spicy miso is fantastic. I do wish it had a little more meat to it though. Will definitely order from them again!', u'The veggie ramen was very greasy, I left about 95% of it and yet I was still charged for it, even after I brought it up to their attention. Not a good experience.', u\"This place wasn't good. We all had veggie ramen, it was bland, and we didn't enjoy it at all. It was four of us and two of us didn't eat ours. The other two ate theirs only because they were starving and didn't want to waste their money. We left a minimal tip (maybe 6 or 7$)on the table even though we didn't enjoy our food and service was ok. We were there for maybe 25 minutes. We leave the restaurant and some man from the restaurant runs out after us, and is holding a receipt saying we didn't leave a tip! We were all confused and caught off guard. The audacity of him! Another waitress from inside then tells him nevermind, because I guess she realized that we did leave a tip. So he's says oh nevermind sorry to us and we leave. Seriously I've never heard of such! What if we didn't want to leave a tip? You were going to come make us leave a tip? Crazy! And the food wasn't good. It sucked! Oh and to top it off they only accept cash.\", u'Tonkatsu ramen was plain in general. noodle was soggy and the broth has no flavor. The pork buns are stuffed with some chopped pork bit!', u\"Ordered delivery twice from them. Glad they deliver to Greenpoint. First time food was really great. We had the extra spicy ramen, pork bun, and fried rice. Second time we ordered a week later the same thing but also added the fried chicken. Food was still good the second time but not consistent with the first time we ordered. The spicy ramen wasn't spicy at all and looked different.. We double checked the order again and it was identical to the first time. Was still good, but just different than we expected. \\nWe will probably order again but hope it can be as good as the first time!\", u\"We're in town visiting for my brother's wedding. We've been eating out for every meal and this place was a hit. Between the 6 of us, we tried the Spicy Miso, Samurai Tonkotsu, and Abura Soba (dry style was delicious)..The noodles were cooked perfectly and the broth was flavorful. Even our 1 year old loves it...he has quite the palate and chicken tikka masala WAS his favorite. Hahaha. Will definitely pay another visit before we leave town.\"], u'192.The River Caf\\xe9': [u\"I celebrated my birthday here, and it was definitely an amazing experience. If you're entering via car, they have a driveway right to the door, and if you're driving, they have valet available. The whole place had such a romantic atmosphere especially with the little park they have beside them. \\n\\nWe did the 3-course dinner menu for $130 per person. The chef gave us a little tasting plate of fluke, which definitely opened up our palettes. The restaurant had nice bread options going around. Appetizers were Wagyu Steak Tartare and Scallop/Pork Belly, which were amazing! I definitely would order again. The chef then gave another tasting of corn ravioli and gnocchi with crispy asparagus, which were all so good. Our entrees were Niman Ranch Strip Steak and the Duck Breast. The steak came with bone marrow mashed potato, and that was a highlight on its own. It's definitely a nice size portion wherein my boyfriend even shared some with me, and that rarely happens! My duck breast tasted delicious as well; however, I was not a big fan of the sweet potato spaetzle that it came with. Now, on to dessert! We ordered the chocolate Brooklyn Bridge and key lime souffl\\xe9. 10/10 would order the souffl\\xe9 again, I just wanted a whole pint of that graham cracker ice cream. I enjoyed all the elements of the Brooklyn Bridge, and it's honestly a very pretty cake for my birthday, but would try something else if we dine here again. You absolutely need to get it for your first time! The chef also gave us tiny dessert pieces including two chocolates, jelly, and a macaron. We had a delicious bottle of wine (Napa 2007) recommended by the sommelier that both fit our entrees. \\n\\nService was amazing from finish to end. They are very attentive to your needs, so you never feel like you lack anything. They always do it before you even think about asking for it. \\n\\nI would recommend that you book at 530pm like we did because that got us a table right by the window, and it's much more intimate before the dinner rush sets in. Plus you get to see the sunset as well. We didn't feel rushed at all, and we took our time with our meals. It was very romantic especially when night came, and the restaurant was lit with candles and the Manhattan skyline. A gorgeous view to accompany such a wonderful evening.\", u'Meh..... \"the view is nice\" is about the best thing you can say, apart from that its an over price pretentious \"NY institution\".\\n\\nIf it was more reasonably priced I\\'d maybe rate it 4 stars (eg $200 pp with tip + one glass of wine etc) but the tables are too close together, the tables staff too intrusive etc for it to be considered \"fine dining\".\\n\\nIts menu leans towards \"seafood\" though from the dishes I tried the rabbit and the duck won the night.\\n\\nUnderwhelmed but pretty busy night though even for a Sunday so maybe its just me.', u'KenScale: 8.0/10\\n\\nRecently my wife Jun and I celebrated our first year anniversary since we became couples. How time flies so quickly! I was looking for a special place to celebrate that we hadn\\'t been to (after all, we\\'ve been to A LOT OF restaurants...), and found River Caf\\xe9 that sits beneath the iconic Brooklyn Bridge that we cross on weekends from time to time. The restaurant has been an old school classic until it shuttered during Hurricane Sandy. I don\\'t know how the restaurant looked before the hurricane, but the d\\xe9cor inside and outside was absolutely charming, and the killer view of East River from our table was definitely something to remember for our special day. The food at River Caf\\xe9 was overall satisfying as well.\\n\\nAt River Caf\\xe9, you can opt for three-course prix fixe at $130 per person or six-course signature tasting menu at $160 per person. For our special day, we wanted a full experience so went for the latter option. The dishes from River Caf\\xe9 tend to be on the classical side than the inventive. The tasting menu felt a little bit dated that way, and there were some issues with seasoning or execution. Jun thought adding soy to the fresh abalone was a total overkill, and I wasn\\'t quite sold on the scallop ceviche in the first dish. On the other hand, I liked the refined shrimp and king crabmeat accompanied by citrus Maltaise sauce that gave a nice flavor to the gently touched seafood (although Jun thought the flavor was a bit overpowering). Atlantic halibut that came next was nicely cooked, but we both left wondering why the maitake mushroom on top of the fish came out so salty. One of my favorites during our meal was the seared foie gras. I was pleasantly surprised that the kitchen brought out strawberry jam underneath the tender foie gras that added something new to the table. On the other hand, strip steak didn\\'t come out the juicy medium rare that we typically like our steak to be. It was still a good steak nonetheless, with minimum seasoning just the way we prefer (the side dish of bone marrow Duchess potato and red wine mushroom marmalade next to the meat helped with adding flavor). Of the two desserts that came out, we liked the refreshing touch of coconut sorbet and raspberry granita, but the \"Brooklyn Bridge\" chocolate was too sweet, even for a sweet tooth like Jun. \\n\\nI didn\\'t get much issue getting a reservation about two weeks in advance, but the restaurant was packed with a good mix of locals and tourists during our meal. There is full bar with some surprisingly affordable wine options in the expansive list. As noted above, the atmosphere is definitely a stunner at River Caf\\xe9 so if you\\'re looking for an awesome view while dining for a special occasion, this place is a nice option to consider for your next special anniversary. The restaurant requires jackets for all gentlemen, so bear that in mind as well. We wished our meal at River Caf\\xe9 were as magical as the view of Brooklyn Bridge above us, but still there was enough to like about from the sophistication of cooking that we wouldn\\'t mind coming back for another trip to Brooklyn. I look forward to more restaurant trips with my beloved wife for years to come!', u\"We went here for a small 80 person wedding and it was gorgeous! Cocktail hour service was great with passed (delicious) hor d'oeuvres and servers always made sure you had a drink in hand \\nService was impeccable during dinner service as well and all the food was cooked well also. Probably some of the best wedding food I've had but I wouldn't expect anything less from this place. Oh, and I also looooove all the fresh flowers and roses, and giant greenery (huge fiddle leaf figs) in the lobby and basically everywhere!\", u\"If any employee of the River Cafe is reading this, please let the bosses know that requiring a jacket in the main dining room when it is 95 degrees and humid outside is downright criminal. There should be some reverse-white pants rule where no jacket is required between memorial day and labor day. If the view wasn't so gosh darn pretty, I wouldn't have bothered, alas, the location and ambiance make it a good spot for a celebratory meal. Although speaking of ambiance, everything is nice except, as another yelper pointed out, the chairs are like patio lawn chairs. I normally wouldn't mind straw chairs, but I'm also not normally paying $200 for a restaurant experience. \\n\\nThe food itself is ok, Nothing spectacular, but very solid. The wagyu tartare is pretty good, as is the rabbit app. The lobster main course was a little off and a slightly stale-seafood-y taste to it, but overall still aite. The branzino was really good because of this bread crust which I can only presume to be 80% butter 20% bread. So tasty, just run a mile beforehand and you're fine. The goat cheese cheesecake is light & doesn't have a strong tang to it. The lime souffle is good but not spectacular.\", u'Romantic to the max! If you ever want to impress your date, or celebrate anything, take them here!\\n\\nThe River Cafe is located right on the East River and by the Brooklyn Bridge. While its location and view are spectacular, it is not very close to  the subway station so I recommend taking a cab here.\\n\\nI\\'ve been to this place twice, once with my gf, once with my family, so I have basically tasted every single items on the menu. Their wine list... just WOW... you can find almost anything you want... even those that cost $10k per bottles... one day... one day...\\n\\nFor appetizer, foie gras duet and roasted rabbit are two dishes that stood out the most for me. And for entree, you won\\'t be disappointed with either the strip steak (amazing bone marrow potato side), duck breast (one of the most tender piece of meat I\\'ve ever tasted), lamb (nicely charred, very juicy inside), or lobster (beautifully plated with very buttery meat). \\n\\nI feel that their dessert is a little weak compared to the rest of the meal. The chocolate Brooklyn bridge is a must if it\\'s your first time to the restaurant, it just perfectly complemented the view out the window. But the rest of the items doesn\\'t really make me say \"wow, this is a Michelin starred dish.\"\\n\\nOverall, a cozy romantic place and attentive service, I will be back!\\n\\nTips:\\n+ jackets are required for men, if you don\\'t have one, they can lend you one as well with advanced notice\\n+ after dinner, take a stroll around the Brooklyn Bridge park, amazing view of the city, especially at night', u\"Really great food in a spectacular atmosphere. The waiting staff were all pleasant and the perfect blend of attentive, and sociable, while it being over bearing.\\n\\nThe space has fantastic views of Manhattan and really is something to behold.\\n\\nThe food was incredible, I had the pork and scallops to start, and the lamb for mains, with the key lime souffl\\xe9 for dessert.\\n\\nIf I'm honest the key lime souffl\\xe9 wasn't much to write home about, but I'm the first to admit, I'm also not really a fan of dessert.  That being said It was cooked well and the flavor was good.\\n\\nThe starters and mains truly were delicious. Everything was cooked perfectly and packed flavor and texture with every bite.\\n\\nPrice wise, its $125 pp for 3 courses. For two of us the total bill came to $338 excl tip. We had 2 gin and tonics and a glass of prosecco, so pretty standard price for drinks in a nice setting.\\n\\nOverall, the River Cafe  is a really great restaurant, and definitely a great location for a special occasion!\", u\"I went here on date night and i must say it was better then I thought!!!  I thought it was going to be very stuffy and overrated.  But I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and the service.  When we arrived they immediately pointed us to the bar, not a problem for me because I like to drink:)  However a few people mention the pointed out the reservation thing?!?!  \\n\\nOur service was nice and the food was good.....HOWEVER...I was quite surprised when this place got my order wrong?!?!?  I order the steak and of course I wanted it Medium....well to my great shock it came our well well done????  Of course I showed the waiter who agreed immediately and took it back.  The issue is my BF's meal came out so he was eating(and sharing) while we waited for them to cook another steak for me.  I was a lil annoyed by that but my BF is cool as hell so he just got me more drinks and shared his meal with me.  Of course when the steak came out I did the same.  The also brought out a larger portion of mashed/puree potatoes.  Other then that I did have a good time.\\n\\nThe view/location is everything!!!!  I will be back I want to see if Brunch is the same feeling??\", u'The River Cafe has received enough five star ratings that it barely makes sense to add another -- but given some negative experiences from a few reviewers, I wanted to write to reassure others: Those most have been off nights. Because the restaurant is an exquisite, old school New York dining experience.\\n\\nWe were a little early -- they won\\'t seat anyone until the full party is there, so we sat in the small bar area next to the pianist. Our two other guests were stuck in traffic, so we were late for our reservation -- but they still accompanied us.\\n\\nThe food:\\n\\nI don\\'t eat seafood but everyone else in my party does, and everyone loved what they ordered. One had the salmon, one the sea bass. Can\\'t recall the third, but I imagine you can\\'t go wrong.\\n\\nMy appetizer was the pear salad -- I have to say, I tend not to like pears, but when they\\'re grilled a sweetness comes out that is so yummy. Loved all the different flavors in this dish.\\n\\nThen I had the steak. No, I actually had ALL the steak -- it was a perfect cut, and cooked exactly the way I like it, medium well. I know this preference often offends chefs and sometimes they\\'ll go a little far to emphasize the \"well done\" part -- the chef here cooked it exactly right.\\n\\nI\\'ve said this in other reviews: Have the bread. It\\'s worth it. \\n\\nAlso, I\\'d recommend not eating a lot during the day -- this is a prix fixe meal, and you want to enjoy every morsel. Again, it\\'s worth it.\\n\\nHAVE DESSERT. My god, what they offered was unbelievable. One person in our party was having a birthday, so like other folks, they created a specialized little dessert for her. I had the key lime souffle (it takes a few extra minutes to make). Another person got the goat cheese cheesecake, another the pistachio semifreddo and the fourth got the apple mille feuille. we tasted each others\\' and one was more exquisite than the next. We also appreciated that the chef gets that we\\'ve just gorged ourselves on phenomenal food, and so the dessert portions are not overwhelming in size or in flavors. The perfect size, the perfect combinations of flavors on each plate.\\n\\nSome tips:\\n\\n1. Try for an early reservation. You\\'re at an unbelievably high-end restaurant, and so you don\\'t want your meal to be rushed. The views are astounding. The place will be packed, so expect the timing of your meal and the care that is given to each dish for each guest to reflect that. We had outstanding service, from the beginning of the meal to the end. But you\\'re eating at a Michelin-starred restaurant. Be patient, and you will be rewarded.\\n\\n2. Don\\'t try to walk in without a reservation. I think a few reviewers seemed to be offended that they walked in and then weren\\'t accommodated -- but dude, it\\'s THE RIVER CAFE. At the very least, give a call before walking over. Also, dress nicely -- they will turn you away if you were just strolling around in Brooklyn for the day and aren\\'t dressed up. Best to reserve well in advance.\\n\\n3. Bring sunglasses. No, I\\'m not kidding -- if you\\'re there for an earlier dinner, you\\'ll be getting the beginnings of sunset -- and if you have sensitive eyes, it\\'ll make it tough to enjoy the beautiful view.\\n\\n4. I\\'d suggest two or three people in your party max -- it gets very loud because it is always full. If you want to have a nice, romantic dinner or good conversation to accompany your wonderful meal, smaller is better.\\n\\n5. Watch your alcohol consumption. This isn\\'t a safe driving PSA, it\\'s just easy to forget because what they have is so good. Only two of us drank, one of whom had two glasses of prosecco, and the other of whom had a bourbon cocktail and a glass of prosecco. That brought us to around $100 in alcohol alone. (The prosecco was wonderful, as I\\'m sure all their wine choices are).\\n\\nI cannot think of anything even slightly negative to say about this experience. I plan to save my pennies and return for other special occasions in the future. Believe me, it\\'s worth it.', u\"Best indoor view of the Brooklyn Bridge you'll get. It was raining the day we tried to walk the bridge and we gave up and came here instead. We didn't have a reservation, but were able to be seated at the bar. The irish coffees - literally the best I've ever had in my whole life. It takes almost 10 minutes to make one, but worth every minute. Didn't eat here, but the service was also spectacular.\", u'I went here for my bday dinner. Loved the restaurant and the food and the service. Would definitely recommend this place if you want a romantic/celebratory fancy dinner.\\n\\nFood: I ordered the vegetarian menu, and the entree was way too good. For a change a restaurant and their chef had put some real effort in the vegetarian food. I would always go back for there mushroom entree.\\n\\nAmbience: You get views of the East river and the brooklyn bridge. Just too beautiful.\\n\\nService: Excellent service. They check back pretty often. They also did small bday special for me.\\n\\nWould definitely recommend this place if your wallet is a little on the heavier side.', u'Spectacular Dinner with my sweetie. Good experience for whoever want to be \\nHappy anniversary', u\"My wife and I are in our late 20's / early 30's, and chose The River Cafe for our special night out on our visit to New York City. They did not disappoint! Everything is spectacular, from arrival to departure, all of your expectations are exceeded. We had a beautiful view of the restaurant / river, as well as a delicious & romantic meal together. Granted, this is the most expensive bill I have ever received for supper, but it was actually worth it. My wife was beyond impressed. \\n\\nNote that it is pretty difficult to get from Manhattan to Brooklyn around supper time, so allow yourself PLENTY of time for the taxi ride anytime between 4pm and 8pm. We were about 15 minutes late, but a phonecall to the hostess bought us extra time. \\n\\nHighly recommend for a beautiful, romantic night out.\", u\"Terrible cancellation policy!!! Don't take Physicians out to dinner here and don't reserve with a company card!!!. They need 72 hrs notice even with 6 people reservation.....Require a contract.....You Will charge $130 even if you want to rebook. Manager is completely inflexible even to move the reservation without a charge after this 72 hr time frame!!!!\", u'The River Caf\\xe9 is officially the most romantic spot in all of New York.\\n\\nYou are first greeted by tons of lush greenery strung with the brightest fairy lights. You are greeted by the most polite hosts and you are whisked away into the restaurant literally on top of the river, with the most jaw dropping view of Manhattan!\\n\\nI came here for a celebration with my hubs, and his co-workers and had the best time! The service was impeccable and the food was divine. They only offer a dinner prix fixe, but had plenty of options! I had the special of the day - a truffle raviolo topped with mushrooms. SO delicious! I went with the lobster for my main course, which came with divine squid ink cavetelli. I finished off my meal with the most amazingly soft pumpkin souffl\\xe9! Food here is top quality and well worth the price :) \\n\\nHighly recommend The River Caf\\xe9 for a romantic night out! Love this spot!', u\"The boyfriend surprised me with a birthday dinner here in the summer. I was blown away by the d\\xe9cor upon walking in, a restaurant that sits amidst a garden with fairy lights and oversees the water with a view of the Brooklyn Bridge.\\n\\nThe boyfriend tried to ask for a table by the water but we got seated in the furthermost corner instead, which I was okay with. It was a cozy enough section with us sitting adjacent to each other. Of course it would have been even better to sit directly by the water, but we were able to take a stroll after dinner along River Cafe's outdoor deck and take plenty of pictures.\\n\\nIt was $125 fixed price per person for appetizer, main course, and dessert. For appetizers, I got the Sea Scallop and Foie Gras, which I enjoyed, but the Foie Gras got too heavy for me to finish entirely without the bf's help. He got the seasonal Crispy Tempura Soft Shell Crab which was served with a watermelon, pickled jicama and pineapple salad, which was refreshing. \\n\\nFor the main courses, I got the poached Nova Scotia Lobster served with squid ink cavatelli pasta and spinach gratin while he got the 16oz Niman Ranch Strip Steak which was served with a bone marrow Duchess potato. I really enjoyed my entree while the boyfriend stuffed himself silly with the massive meat and potatoes. \\n\\nWe ended off with the iconic Brooklyn Bridge dessert for me and the Pistachio Semifreddo for him. Honestly, of the entire dessert menu, the Brooklyn Bridge sounded the least appealing to me, but the bf insisted I should try the Bridge. And when it came on the plate, it was certainly something cute to take a photo of but I didn't really eat much of the chocolate pieces shaping the bridge and ultimately enjoyed the boyfriend's dessert more. We also received a few additional complimentary chocolates and macaron. \\n\\nThe only thing that really detracted from the experience was the service. It was perfunctory and sufficient, but not the most attentive. Perhaps we looked young and we didn't order any wine, but we felt largely ignored in the corner. We tried to get the attention of our waiter so he could help take a picture of the two of us ... to the point a kind lady sitting next to us took pity on us and offered to take it for us, stating she knows how it feels. \\n\\nThe waiter was also surprisingly not the most tactful. While taking our dessert orders, he asked bluntly if we were celebrating any event, birthday, anniversary, etc. so he can jot it down in his pad. Taken aback, we replied it was my birthday. We understand River Cafe is probably expected to be a place for mainly special occasions, but the way the staff handled that as if they were a factory churning out routine celebration desserts didn't seem to fit in with the high end etiquette the restaurant supposedly promoted. My boyfriend was disappointed, admitting to me he had even purposefully excused himself earlier in the meal to remind the staff that it was my birthday. This just made us feel like they didn't really take our table into much consideration.\\n\\nUltimately, it's worthwhile to experience the River Cafe at least once. Too bad the service was underwhelming compared to the food and ambiance. 3.5 stars.\", u\"This is my first review of The River Cafe, although I've been here several times. It's all about the view and the service and the food, in closely following order. I like the fact that the menu is entirely prix-fixe. It's not inexpensive for NY standards. \\n\\nIn my experience, the fish entrees are the way to go. From the Sea Bass to the Monkfish and the Branzino, they are all great. I ordered the steak this last time and while it was very good, this isn't a steak house. \\n\\nThe ambiance is a bit old-school, the view is very much one of a kind and the service is top notch. Bring your most romantic dates, partners, wives, husbands etc. PRO-TIP - if you want the view with out going all in for dinner, just go sit in the bar and order a drink, where jackets aren't required.\", u'I had very nice dinner here ! View from restaurant was amazing and everyone working here was very kind and nice, food and presentation were excellent!', u'Amazing! From the ambience to the service and continues my to the elegant, taste creations from the kitchen, this was by far the best lean I have ever had. The view of NYC at sunset was awesome. Anytime we are in NYC we will return!', u\"Came here for lunch for mom's 50th. Food was exquisite and all waiters were friendly and attentive.  Valet guys were cute too!\\n\\nGot a free Brooklyn Bridge dessert on the house!\"], u'120.Laojie Hotpot': [u\"I've been on a hot pot binge lately and Laojie was next on my hit list! \\n\\nThe lowdown: \\n-$22/person AYCE \\n-They take reservations!\\n-Sauce bar! \\n-Free ice cream, Yakult, and cotton candy for dessert! \\n\\nRESERVATIONS:\\nI made reservations for two an hour before we wanted to eat. Not only were they able to fit us in, they were very accommodating when we had to switch our reservation last minute to three people. \\n\\nBROTH:\\nThey have a decent selection of broths to choose from. If you're dining at a smaller table, it's a communal pot, but you have the option to choose two broths. We ordered the hot & spicy and the bone cylinder (pork bone) soup base. The broths are good, but not as flavorful as Little Sheep. For $22 AYCE, I'm not complaining. \\n\\nFOOD & SAUCES: \\nThey have a good variety of food to dip into the hot pot, with my favorites being the fish paste, fatty beef, fish ball with roe, and tong ho. \\n\\nThe sauce bar is pretty standard. As long as they have all my favorites, I'm happy. My go to is usually a mix of Chinese BBQ sauce, sesame oil, chili oil, and soy sauce with scallions, cilantro, and garlic on the side. \\n\\nTip: Mix the fish paste with the scallions and cilantro from the sauce bar before dropping it into the broth! \\n\\nSERVICE:\\nService was impeccable! When we were first seated, our waiter presented each of us with a wet towel and offered me a hair-tie! He, and other staff, would drop by, non-intrusively, to skim off the fat/foam on top of our broth. Also, he was always somehow around when we wanted to order more food. \\n\\nYELP CHECK-IN:\\nThe check-in special of the night was for scallops, but we received arctic surf clams (the red tipped clams). Just a heads-up if you were expecting scallops, like me. \\n\\nOverall, Laojie exceeded my expectations. All the food we had was of good quality and well portioned. The restaurant itself is very clean, and I saw the staff wiping down the sauce bar numerous times. If you're looking for a great AYCE hot pot place at a steal, your search is over!\", u\"This is my second visit, I had a pleasant experience the first time around and wanted to bring my parents here. \\nI called in for a reservation for 4 people @8pm on Friday night (10/6), my reservation was accepted with no concerns or comments.\\n\\nI showed up with my parents & boyfriend with 5 minutes to spare (7:55) and was told I would need to wait ~ 30 minutes but it may be sooner. I saw that my name was on the top of their waitlist with other names below me already scratched off, I agreed and sat down thinking I was next in line for a table. At about 8:20 they offered us a winter melon (or some other gourd) blended juice drink for our wait. It helped with our hunger and was very considerate of them. In the end I was really disappointed as I saw two parties who arrived after us seated before us. Ultimately we were seated around 8:40. That's 40 minutes past our reservation. \\n\\nThe reason why my review isn't lower than what is currently is is due to my experience thereafter. Although my initial experience was the worse, our waitress Candice really did it for me. Many of the AYCE hotspots in the area are generally the same thing, but her service and attitude are far superior to what I've experienced elsewhere. As soon as we sat down she was already waiting at our table side greeting us and ready for our order.\\n\\nShe was calm, patient, and very helpful in all our requests and inquiries. My parents are your typical Asian parents: loud, talkative, nosy, and takes pictures of everywhere and thing. My dad was constantly moving around and asking for more things, and my mom just kept pointing at everything. Candice treated them with great care and a smile. (A plus too since she spoke fluent English & Chinese and could understand my parents whenever they butt into my requests to assist them as well ) \\n\\nThe food is always superb, my favorite is tomato soup base or the cylinder bone. They always bring a hearty looking plate of beef whenever we order ( unlike other AYCE that only bring out a plate with like 10 slices of beef). Don't forget to check in for your arctic scallops! It's free so don't expect to be bedazzled by it.  \\n\\nAfter placing and finalizing our first order, I went to their sauce station and before I was even back to my table, the soups were already situated and ready to go alongside our first platter of food.\\n\\nOverall after my initial experience everything was great. Shout out to Candice and the other waitstaffs, y'all are the real MVPs.\", u\"I was in NYC during my bday and heard that this place recently opened near me so I decided to visit on a Sunday afternoon. \\nService is nice and if you go early, there's isn't much of a wait. \\nThe food comes very fast, and you can add as you go.\\nI prefer to order a certain amount of food and add as I eat.\\n\\nI think they stop getting birthday perks but having the bday girl portion of the check wavied is a nice bday gift.\\n\\nI do like the sauce bar, but I just hope it can get a bit wider because many people are trying to make their sauces. I recommend the herbal soup base.\", u\"My go-to hotspot spot!! They offer awesome deals when you check-in on yelp (which changes here & there). A huge fan of promos! My first time there, we walked in with 13 ppl without any reservations but seated right away with no issue. \\n\\nIt's all you can eat/buffet style and you can choose if you want an individual or shared pot. The waiters made the whole experience enjoyable. They were patient with our big group as we added numerous orders of beef, refilled our drinks, and took away dirty plates when the table got crowded. The food seemed really fresh and they offer the classic sauce bar, where you can put together your own concoction. \\n\\nI went back for my birthday and celebrated with a cake after. They were so sweet and actually comped my meal for my birthday!! (Aka you don't need to go to 99 anymore)\", u\"Best AYCE hot pot place I've been to so far. It's not a huge place but the decor was cute and detailed. We were seated promptly for our reservation for 4 on Friday night and the service was amazingly friendly, constantly cleaning, clearing plates, checking in on us with a smile. Appreciated how we could have the option for a shared big pot or individual pots. We opted for our own pots since our friend was hacking up half her lung. I chose the Bone Cylinder Soup and it was pretty flavorful, a milky broth with a bone, corn and tomatoes bobbing inside. They have their own mixing section for sauces, but their House Special Sauce was tasty and made my job easier.\\n\\nWhen you check in on WeChat, Facebook or Yelp, they give you a free seafood platter. The rest of the ingredients we ordered was fresh and came in generous portions. Especially loved how they gave us Yakult drinks, a scoop of ice cream and cotton candy at the end. For $21.95, definitely a worthwhile AYCE hot pot.\", u\"I absolutely love this place. Their food is fresh, their broth is delish and the service is amazing. \\n\\nDid I also mention they have karaoke at the front of the restaurant and sometimes they just play through a collection of BSB songs and you get the whole restaurant singing along??\\n\\nRetro game consoles and cotton candy machine at the front, 80/90's memorabilia decor - everything about this place is just spot on. \\n\\nAYCE and much better in terms of both price and quality than the once popular Mister Hotpot option around the corner.\", u\"WOW. I never thought I would ever give an AYCE place five stars, but this place truly deserves it. Everything from the food, environment, and service was amazing. \\n\\nComing on a Saturday at 9:30pm, there was no wait. It was still packed at this time, but for a table for two, I was seated immediately. Since this place is quite smaller than other AYCE places, the wait can be long on a busy day. Need to wait?! No worries! They have a small console for you at the waiting area where you can play your games and wait at the same time. Great for adults and kids haha!\\n\\nThe decorations. LOVE. I am a huge fan of wooden anything, and this place just blows my mind. Really well designed. I love the projector MTV screen to listen and watch your music videos. Love the variety of music they play to accommodate the crowd, from English to Cantonese to Mandarin songs. Great choices of songs as well. \\n\\nOh the service. Spectacular from the start. I wish I got the girl's name that was serving me because she was so kind and attentive. Upon seating, she quickly offered us a wet napkin to wipe our hands down and constantly coming back to ask us if everything was okay. Food came in a quick manor and everything we ordered was served. Hate it when I order something and they just constantly forget, but not the case here!\\n\\nFor an AYCE hot pot place, food was fresh and good. They offer some other stuff like fish roe balls, beef tendon balls, fried tofu skin, and different soup bases at no extra cost which is great! If you check in on Yelp, they give you a free seafood platter which consists of scallops, red surf clams, mussels, and prawns. At the end of your meal, you get free ice cream, yakult, and cotton candy. How awesome is that?!\\n\\nI'm really glad I decided to come here and I was not disappointed. My experience was amazing and I hope their service, food quality and everything else will remain the same the next time I come back and I will be back soon!!\", u\"all you can eat!\\n\\nVERY GOOD!  first off, the place isn't that big but that's ok.  came on a sat. afternoon and was seated immediately.  the decor is very cute.  they also have a huge screen playing music videos or for karaoke.  i love that they have a separate pots option or a large pot to share option at every table.  the place is clean, no sticky menu.  SERVICE IS GREAT!  the waiters come around very often, to remove the top film from your soup, to add water, to take more orders, etc.  i used yelp to check in and received a free seafood combo - awesome.  the cups/pot/plates are very very cute!  overall, great hot pot here.  loved the yakult drink at the end of the meal.  will definitely be back.\", u\"Best AYCE hotpot in NY so far. This is a new addition to the 8th Ave (the Chinatown in Brooklyn). I think Mister Hotpot got its competitor now. \\n\\nMy friend and I came on Tuesday lunch and we didn't have to wait (and we were the only customers there). \\n\\nService: Attentive and nice. Not your typical Chinese-restaurant service. \\n\\nDecor: Cute vintage decoration. The big screen plays all the old songs from my childhood (or teens). The AC is strong enough for you to enjoy hotpot during the summer. \\n\\nFood: Pretty fresh and good quality for AYCE hotpot place. The pork bone and winter melon soup bases were pretty decent. I wish they have white rice tho (as a Cantonese I always want rice with my hotpot). \\n\\nOverall a very pleasant experience. Definitely will return if I feel like having AYCE hotpot (better than Favor 99 for sure).\", u\"UPDATE:\\n\\nI came here again 3 days later with a few friends who are Muslim and thus have dietary restrictions (ie. halal) and the staff were surprisingly super sensitive and attentive to the issue. They went out of their way to accommodate and make my friends feel welcome - separate soup bowls, painstakingly explaining what was and what wasn't halal/meat, making suggestions, keeping separate plates and utensils, etc. I am supremely impressed by how they handled us and will keep coming back!\", u'Im very iffy abt AYCE hot pots but this place had so many good reviews and after coming here, i can see why. Their service is superb, everyone at my table felt the same way. The staff was very attentive, came around very frequently to empty plates, place more orders, refill on soups, etc.\\n\\nI like the idea of havin the choice to choose individual pot or large pot to share. All the foods were very fresh, especially the meats!\\n\\nAt the end of ur meal, they give u ice cream, cotton candy, yogurt drinks and candies. Anddd they also take a polaroid pic of u!\\n\\nI also really liked the decor. Very vintage and nostalgic.\\n\\nOverall, will definitely be back more often!', u'I went here last Friday.Best AYCE Hotspot in Brooklyn , food is fresh and services is very good', u\"I agree with a lot of previous reviews that said this was one of the best hotpot places in NYC. The food was pretty normal, nothing too special. They do have great soup bases though. In my experience, it was the little things that make this place stand out. For starters, they have a karaoke thing in the back, which nobody used, but it was still nice to have really good music in the background. Secondly, their service is phenomenal. They are super attentive, and really help you out, like providing you with a side table when you have too much food. They also reminded me to check in on Yelp for the free seafood platter, which I appreciated. \\n\\nAt the end, they gave us free ice cream and yakult, which was really nice of them too. I'd def come back again!\", u\"Late lunch plan for hot pot before the weather gets even warmer. Walked in was dark ambiance.  Very cute decor with karaoke music playing both English and Chinese old and new songs. Love that they have cassette tape collections hanging on their walls. 90's pop stars portraits bought back lots of memories.  The decor deserves a star. \\n\\nWe immediately got acknowledged and got seated.  Ready to ordered.  First they mistaken our ordered but gladly took it back and offer us complimentary oysters.  Food was fresh and service was understanding. Waiter comes to fill out pots and checks up on us regularly. We even got two yogurt drink to go.  Definitely return back.\", u\"This is probably my favorite AYCE hotpot place in Brooklyn, I still prefer mister hotpot for regular hotpot but this place is pretty darn good! Decor takes you back in time and the music is a combination of old Chinese, mandarin and modern English songs. I liked that their music wasn't tacky.. it was old school hit songs that everyone loved.. I came with my co workers who were around 40 years old and they said it reminds them of their teenage years. Service here is wonderful and they refill your pot without needing you to ask, the staff speaks English!! Which is really rare for hotpot place... haven't seen one yet. They offer you wet naps to wipe your hand as soon as you sit down. There is individual pots as well as shared pots and a large variety of food to chose from, I love that they have fried tofu skin, tomato and fish roe ball as well those are literally the only three things I eat at hotpot! Our table ordered fatty beef and it had black spots on it when we asked our server what it was she promptly took the plate to the kitchen to find out what it was... turns out it was just the specks of blood which is normal, but she went above and beyond to help us exchange the whole plate. I LOVED that she did that without us asking and didn't give us a hard time like some other ayce places.  Afterwards you get ice cream and cotton candy. It is also free on your birthday and if you check in you get a free seafood platter. I have already recommended my sister and her husband here and they love it as well! I hope the service and the quality of food will always remain this good because I plan to come here a lot especially since winter is coming!\", u\"One of the best Hotpot places I have ever been to and I've had my share of Hotpot. \\n\\nLaojie is AYCE $21.95 per person. The value and quality of food you receive makes this place one of the better Hotpot restaurants. I appreciate that you are able to order a wide variety of options on the menu allowing you to try more and different things. \\n\\nFood. \\nFor someone who gets bored of one entree and like to share different dishes, this place is for you! My personal favorites include: porkbone soup-watercress, fish tofu, vermicelli, Fuzhou fish balls, shrimp, tripe, enoki mushrooms and fatty beef. If I were to get everything I wanted at another restaurant, it would be easily be almost doubled the price making this restaurant amazing in value. Check-in and you'll receive a seafood dish which has shrimp, crab claw, mussels, and scallop. The servings are small which is preferred so you can order more of a variety of items and always order more later. \\n\\nService. \\nEveryone was impressive. To the welcome and being seated. I wasn't happy with one of my stained dishes, I didn't say anything because the next second it was switched out for me. Food was expedited. The servers checked on us a few times appropriately and not overbearing which was great. They assisted us in sifting out the gross floating  remnants from the soup. Very attentive service; however one challenge for me is that they don't speak very much English which was difficult. It's okay tho because they were kind and were always willing to assist. \\n\\nI love this place! I await the next rainy day for a chance to dine here again. Service, Staff, food, just everything resonates 5star!\", u\"This is my favorite AYCE hot pot spot in Brooklyn! The service is great and that says a lot because the service at most Asian restaurants suck. The servers are attentive, polite and smiley. They come around to help you scoop out the meat foams from your soup (service I've never seen anywhere else). The music can be a bit a loud but it doesn't bother me. They offer a free probiotic drink and ice cream at the end of your dinner. The only thing I don't like is their fish roe fishballs. It doesn't taste sweet and creamy like the other places. I'm not sure if they always had this kind or if they changed it after offering it for free on their menu (they used to charge $5 for this).\", u\"Came here to celebrate my parent's birthday. Place is small can barely accommodate my family of six. Waitstaff assigned to our table was very nice and attentive; explained the weekly specials, and kinds of soup based broths for our ayce hotpots. Karaoke music in the background boast some great 90's tunes. Birthday person ate for free, and during that time they offered the free seafood bowl upon Yelp check-in. Don't think that deal is on anymore. Menu selections are pretty vast and food are fairly fresh. My parents laughed as they handed us water cups in these old aged mugs. Since I brought over a cake to celebrate the birthday they even turned the karaoke to the Birthday song and the entire staff sang to my parent. He was a bit embarrassed by all the attention, but it was all in good fun. At the end of the meal we can choose ice cream, or cotton candy, and Yakult yogurt drink. I don't know if all these deals are still in place.\", u\"Food- 5 Setting- 5 Service- 5\\n\\nThis is probably the best hot pot place I've been to in New York. The options are limitless and the pricing is amazing. For $21, you could pick and choose an unlimited amount of meat and veggies. The sauce station was clean and had a good range of options to choose from. Service is absolutely amazing and decent. They would come by every now and then to check up on us. After dinner, they offered us ice cream, and made us some cotton candy. The only small con I'd make about this is that the restaurant is a bit far out of town. My boyfriend and I did commute a bit . When we got there it was already packed. We waited for about an hour, but while waiting they served us watermelon juice. If you plan to eat here, make sure you reserve beforehand. It's absolutely worth it though- come hungry, leave happy.\", u'This place will be our new favorite hotpot spot in Brooklyn. My friends and I came here for the first time yesterday for a birthday. I made reservations in advance for party of 8. The restaurant called me an hour in advance to confirm. We arrived on-time and were seated immediately.\\n\\nEverything looked clean. Service was great.  We brought our own liquor. The corkage fee was cheap ($10 per bottle). We will definitely be back here! \\n\\n\\n\\nBirthday person eats for free. =)'], u'204.Bijan\\u2019s': [u'This place is super cozy and the food is excellent. The cheese plate is tasty and it comes with some solid pita bread. My favorite dish, hands down, is the basil shrimp. Epic. \\nThe pickled martinis are delicious and unique. Good selection of wines. Prices for everything are accurate. \\nBeen here a few times, gets better and better. Great place for conversations.\\nThanks Anita and Makeda and Henry! \\nXx', u\"I came to Bijan's a while ago with some Iranian friends who suggested this place for authentic Persian food. It's a small and intimate restaurant. Great for a date, or brunch/a night out with your best girlfriends. \\n\\nIt's beautifully decorated by the paintings by one of the owners of the restaurant, Sepideh, who was absolutely hospitable and a joy to talk to. She's funny and obviously talented. The candles, dim lighting, and the rest of the decor gives it a romantic and almost ethereal atmosphere. \\n\\nThe food really was amazing. I had the Albaloo Polo, which is sour cherry rice with meatballs, and I had a cocktail called Persian Kiss, which tastes as good as it sounds. We had a slice of chocolate cake with strawberries, one of my favorite desserts after flan, made by Sepideh herself, along with a cup of coffee and as a proud coffee lover, it gets two thumbs up. It did take a while to get our food but it was worth the wait. \\n\\nI'll definitely come back to try out more and introduce more people to this place.\", u'This place is wonderful! Today the special was sour cherry rice with meatballs, and it really hit the spot! The meatball was flavorful and the rice was fluffy/soft and the sour cherry was tangy and went well with  everything. We had been wanting to try persian food and was recommended by our Iranian friends. It is very authentic! (While also having modern twists)\\n\\nWe also had as appetizers the basil shrimp with spaghetti squash which was very tasty. The shrimp cut butterfly style and the squash gave a nice texture.\\n\\nThe decor was comfortable and has a natural feel. I like the greenery arranged in the front and the exposed brick and window in the back.\\n\\nWe also met the owner who was very nice and told us  that she painted some of the paintings decorating the wall. Very cool!', u\"I've been trying to break out of the ordering-food-to-the-hotel-room-and-inhaling-it-in-my-pyjamas cycle ever since I started traveling to NYC for work. I decided to get a solo dinner and Bijan's worked well because it's intimate and really cozy, and so I wouldn't feel out of place among large tables of groups. \\n\\nI reached there at about 8 pm on a Tuesday and seated immediately. The d\\xe9cor really works for this place and I'm happy that they didn't try to go overly kitschy with the Persian theme. There are candles, planters, book shelves and artwork, with two larger bench like tables and a bunch of smaller ones \\n No booths! \\n\\nI ordered the lavender bijan (made with gin, $11) and two appetizers - the garlic eggplant ($6) and the basil shrimp with spaghetti squash ($13), and I ended up bringing most of the garlic eggplant, served with crisp pita triangles, back home. The basil shrimp were so buttery and rich! I'm not one for vegetable noodle substitutes but the spaghetti squash really worked! The garlic eggplant was a kickier version of baba ghanoush. The lavender bijan wasn't really my thing, but that's on me. I was trying out something new instead of my regular jalapeno mojito, and I imagine that if you like strong lavender flavors, you'll really like it. \\n\\nService was good, and I felt like I was attended to without being fussed over. The server was also really helpful in giving suggestions on portion sizes. \\n\\nPortions are pretty generous, so I'd love to stop by here with a friend for a repeat round of a great evening!\", u'Super good Yelp recco.  Lovely people, serving very fresh & flavorful food.   Kitchen open until 11pm.  Saved a west coast late Sunday traveler realizing, \"I\\'m famished.\"   Ended up w/ a perfectly cooked meal.  Thanks Bijan\\'s.', u\"Solid brunch spot. Bijan's offers a $17 all-inclusive brunch, which consists of coffee or tea, 1 cocktail, and an entree. Pretty good  deal.\\n\\nPortions are large. In my last visit, I had the Persian Wings & Salad, and I was pleasantly surprised that half of my plate was wings! The Bijan burger patty is thick, juicy and it comes with truffle fries. The fries were a little too soft for my liking, but that wasn't a problem. If you want to add cheese (blue, feta, cheddar) to your burger, it'll cost an additional $1.50.\\n\\nMy favorite part of eating here is sitting by the fireplace. It is so warm and cozy, especially when it's freezing outside. Try to get a seat next to the fireplace, if possible. It'll make your brunch experience that much better.\\n\\nLastly a note on their service: I think the service here was both professional and attentive! They did rush us a bit towards the end, even though the restaurant had lots of empty tables. Besides that, we were very happy with their service! Not sure what the one star reviews were complaining about.\", u\"3rd time I've been to Bijan's and always have a good time. The staff is friendly and somewhat attentive (small staff = overwhelmed if restaurant is full) this particular occasion my friend had to ask twice for another drink before it was brought to the table.\\nThe atmosphere is warm and inviting low lights make it an intimate dinner experience.\\nI had the steak Frits and it was delicious my friend had the turkey burger and she was pleased with the over all taste. I had my drink of choice which is a jalape\\xf1o margarita which tasted more like a sweet mojito so that was why the 4 stars instead of 5 I like my jalape\\xf1o Margarita to be spicy.\\nI'll be back, the meal alone has be coming back for more.\", u\"First of all I have to say that the food here gets five stars. It's obviously very fresh, really well seasoned, beautifully plated. The portions are a great size, in some cases bigger than average.  As a table we had the pistachio salmon, chicken kabob, lamb burger and I think the last one was a Bijan burger. The burgers looked amazing, and our friends described them as wonderful. My salmon and my partner's kabob were delicious and really filling. \\n\\nI love the atmosphere here, the decor and the silent movies playing on the wall. The wait staff was very pleasant and the food was brought out in good time even though the place was packed.\\n\\nHowever I have to give this place only four stars for the following reasons:  It had just rained and in the summer when it rains, shortly after it gets super humid. They left the doors open. It was hotter and more humid inside the restaurant than it was outside. They should have shut the doors, turned on the AC and allowed us to eat in comfort.  Another thing was that every time someone stood outside and smoked, it didn't matter that they were outside. Because the doors were open it felt like they were smoking right beside me while I was eating, so what's the point of them even going outside? \\n\\nHowever if those things won't bother you, definitely come here. The food is well worth!\", u'An awesome mix of authentic/traditional Persian dishes and more contemporary Persian-American. Owned and managed by a nice Iranian couple - the wife often makes the delicious stew specials.\\n\\nCasual spot with tables and picnic seating and a \"hip\" Brooklyn vibe. Great cocktails as well.', u'This place needs to be on every \"best of Brooklyn\" list if only for the gracious service. The bartenders and waitress were all great! We just popped in for a round but there were regulars there who obviously returned for the warm rapport and conversation.\\n\\nPete had a negroni and I had a glass of wine. We shared truffle fries and I asked the girl to bring mayo with the fries (only God can judge me).  The fries were really truffle-y! The wine was great but I should have gotten beer; they have many great beers.\\n\\nThe spot is small and they only have one toilet. It\\'s a good first date spot or a spot to have a drink at the bar alone. This is a really solid awesome place and I will definitely be back soon.', u'ordered\\ncocktail : the Bajin cocktail , Persian Kiss, \\nappetizers : roasted garlic eggplant, tomato cucumber salad,\\nmain : chicken kabob + rice with a touch of coconut milk,\\nabout 60 bucks.\\n\\n2 stars to the cocktails. The bajin seems to be localized with little cayenne pepper, rich pineapple mixed juice.\\n\\nthe Persian Kiss is ok, sparkling wine...\\n\\n2 stars to the chicken kabob, impressed by the touch of coconut milk on the rice, aroma n flavor was there, fully well cooked rice. Soft n juicy chicken kabob.\\n\\n**\\nthe roasted garlic eggplant actually taste very good, match very well with the slight crisp n soft pita bread slice. \\n...but expect getting a lot of burp n gas afterwards.\\n\\n**\\nvery good ambient for small talk n chatting, small group n couple.\\n\\n**\\nwas served by a very nice, attentive server.\\na fork is replaced after it is dropped on the ground... how nice is that :p !!\\n\\nit was a weekday night, not crowded.', u\"Came here with a friend a few days ago. \\n\\nI absolutely love the decor and ambiance of this place! The vibe is bohemian rustic garden; great for just hanging out with a friend or a date.\\n\\nService was good. It was a tad bit slow (there was only one person and they were the bartender AND waitress, so I get it), but we really didn't mind because we were there to chill and unwind, not gulp our food down and run.\\n\\nDrinks were delicious... and I love that they have a happy hour that starts at noon (don't judge me!) \\n\\nThe food was delicious as well. My friend had a salad that she really enjoyed and I had the wings which earn a million hundred point emojis. I expected them to be spicy, but they weren't (I like spice, but I'm not complaining about this) and they were also packed with flavor.\\n\\nTo sum it up, I will definitely be back to Bijan's... I want to try some of the other items on their menu.\", u\"If you want to hear about the drugs that the bartender has done, the entire bottle of Hennessy that he drank the night before, and how much he hates working at this bar then this is a great place to be. \\n\\nWe walked in after an event at Barclays and asked what kind of bourbon this supposed cocktail bar (and the best in downtown BK according to Yelp) and had and the bartender point to a badly organized shelf and then sigh his way through making our poorly made old fashioneds, which are featured on the menu. \\n\\nThe place has potential but we left before we even finished our drinks because our bartender's attitude was simply just that miserable. \\n\\nNote to the owners - your Saturday night bartender has a shit attitude about life in general and is probably chasing people away from your business. Send him off to dive bar purgatory, he is hurting your bottom line.\", u\"The decor and ambiance are top class. The food was fantastic. We came in for brunch and had eggs benedict and coffee all around. The waitress was very nice, I don't know her name but she was an absolute pleasure. Definitely recommend.\", u\"A true gem in Brooklyn! If you're a fan of authentic Persian food, tasty cocktails, and cozy ambiance, this is your next spot to visit. My friend and I decided to stop by for dinner Thursday night and we started with two cocktails - the Jasmine Vesper and the Bijan Teanj. I'd definitely say the Bijan Teani was my favorite, especially since I'm kind of an earl grey fanatic in all forms . For appetizers, we got the chicken wings (always a good choice) and an eggplant trio which brought me back to my Persian roots and gave me great case of nostalgia for the good ol' days of smoked eggplant with the family. \\n\\nFor the main course, we shared the kabob koobideh AKA the Persian beef kabob. Sooo good and tasted super authentic. I heard they have Persian stews most other nights, so I think we will have to make another stop for dinner soon to try some out! \\n\\nOh and if you somehow have room for dessert with the large portions, try the tiramisu. Might seem like a random choice (esp with all the great tiramisu options in New York), but trust me--- your taste buds will thank you!!\", u\"This place is small but not uncomfortable. A reservation is not a bad idea.\\n\\nThe food is delicious and the plating is beautiful. I generally don't notice plating, but it was so good that I couldn't help but notice it. \\n\\nI got the lamb burger with feta. There was a little too much feta but I scraped some off and actually put it on my fries. The burger was perfectly cooked. My companions all enjoyed their meals. Two of us described the food as wonderful.\\n\\nThere was a silent film playing on the wall in front of our table so in addition to a great meal, we also had some unexpected entertainment.\", u\"As I sit here waiting for my friend to arrive, the waitress is already acting as if I do not exist..... I've watched her take care of people that've arrived after me, bringing them water and taking their order. While I sit here having to flag her down for both... After she took water to both tables I purposely waited to see if she was coming to me next. She just went about her business cleaning up the tables around me as if I weren't sitting here....\\n\\nI'll elaborate further at the end of my experience here...\\n\\nSoooooooo I wound up leaving 10 minutes after I left the top portion of this review. I ordered calamari. Found plastic in it. I left. \\n\\nNever returning.\", u'Great neighborhood spot.  Love the wings and calamari.  Pulled pork is good too.  Nice cocktails and good beer and wine selection too.', u\"First time coming in, waiter wasn't very friendly. Half of the items on the menu were unavailable and the wait took AN HOUR AND A HALF even though the restaurant was half full. Certain parties had to leave without even getting their food. \\n\\nThe waiter (Ali) was not apologetic about this, and didn't refill our water once during the hour and a half wait.\\n\\nSo the kitchen staff was a mess for some reason and the waiter didn't even apologize for it. \\n\\nFood was average and ambience is nice, but definitely not coming back.\", u'3 out of the last 5 days. Although I show the steak in the pic, the lime chicken is my fav. Do it!\\nCasual environment pretty consistent st delivering tasty warm dishes.'], u'4.Four Five Six': [u'I work from home and I am proud to announce my favorite restaurant/bar 456 is now serving lunch/brunch!!! \\nThe other day I set up shop (my laptop) and got all my work done. \\nIn that time I had a heavenly chicken waffles and coffee. \\nHung out with the cool bartender who told me all the many pieces of art that adorn the walls are from local Brooklyn artists. (A beautiful mural being one of his own)\\nThen finally insisted one my girlfriends join me on her walk home from work for the happy hour sangria. \\nA pretty good day if I do say so myself.', u'If Central Perk was a real place, that would be it. This place is probably the best place in all New York. Just that. I am so obsessed with this bar and restaurant. I Love the vibe, love the bartenders, love the coziness, love the toilet, love the music, love the decor, love the other customers. If you never love before, this place will make your heart melt and you will finally know what love is.', u'Great spot for drinks outside and live music. Cozy set up w plush couches, funky decor and kind staff. Nice spot for a date.', u'Killer spot!  Ambience is unique to the neighborhood and service was on point.  Loved the decor and hand picked treasures on display.  Indoor and outdoor venue had a great vibe and flow.  Make sure to check out the old photo hanging in the bathroom-- of the old row houses that used to stand next door!', u\"Too cute. Really cozy bar with kitschey decor and plenty of places to sit. There's a spacious outdoor area and on a nice day they open the big garage door so there's plenty of sunlight. I had a good cocktail and the meat and cheese plate so I can't speak to the rest of the food although it all looked good.\", u\"Legit feel like I'm on vacation when I go here and I only live a block away! This place nails it on ambiance. Bring a small group of friends and have an adorable evening out! The food is good, drinks are strong, staff is kind, and the patio with live jazz gives me all sorts of life. #SOOPERKYOOT\", u'Awesome vibe - but for zero reason it closes its bar for hours in the middle of the day Sat/Sun. Kitchen switching to dinner service I understand but closing the bar? Get a grip.', u'This place is the best kept secret in Brooklyn. Decor is on point, drinks are totally reasonable and you can order amazing food from Ringolevio next door. Love the cozy couches and unpretentious vibe. Feels like home.', u'So cute! So cozy! So chill! The crowd is relaxed and fun.  Feels kind of like an elevated summer camp or something like that. Love the open air and inside/outside situation and bet it will be great in the winter too! Stands out as something different in he neighborhood, and ringolevio next door is always a sure bet for a proper meal.', u'This is an amazing place! They just added an addition and it is extremely artsy, alternative and cozy! The food is wonderful too! The owner was very nice and told us about the history of the restaurant. The serving size was perfect. I will come back soon! There is local jazz musicians on Tuesday night too!', u\"Found this amazing gem when I entered their cool entrance off of Richardson Street. My boyfriend and I relaxed on one of the comfy couches and loved all of the original details we observed. For dinner, my boyfriend had the gnocchi bolognese, which he loved, while I had the market fish, which was the Bronzino. It was awesome! A girlfriend of mine shared with me that there's a great tuesday night jazz scene here, that I can't wait to explore next week.\"], u'201.HANKI Everyday Korean': [u\"Very unassuming small restaurant which serves delicious Korean food !\\nPark slope doesn't have a huge variety of high quality ethnic restaurants but this place is definitely one of them.\\nI'm Asian so know Asian food very well.\\nPlus our family has food allergies/ food preferences and it managed to satisfy us all!!! \\nMy husband who only eats chicken and fish ordered the Miso chicken in hot stone bowl.\\nMy son and I both have gluten intolerance and had the beef bulgolgi rice.\\nMy daughter who prefers vegetables had the vegetarian rice in hot stone bowl. \\nLarge portions of food and we even have leftovers to take home!\\nHighly highly recommend !\\nMy only criticism is I wish they opened on Sundays!!! And maybe took a day off on Monday instead .\", u\"I was really craving Korean food and was not in the mood to trek all the way to ktown for it. I found this place with really good reviews so decided to get the bulgogi beef, soft tofu stew, and scallion pancake with seafood.\\n\\nThe bulgogi beef came with some type of grain rice while the soft tofu stew did not come with rice at all. (good thing I ordered an extra side of white rice). For $13.75, the bulgogi beef's portion was laughable. There was barely anything in the takeout container. It was good, but nothing special. The banchan that came with it was also very small in portion size, but I think they were my favorite.\\n\\nI actually enjoyed the soft tofu stew, and this was actually a good portion, beside the fact that it doesn't come with rice which just really confuses me.\\n\\nThe scallion pancake with seafood was just basically dough. Pass on this.\", u'I stumbled up on this little gem and visit at least once a week...sometimes twice. I love the Vegetable Rice Bowl (Bibimbap) and I alternate between ordering the cold one with multigrain rice and the hot one (Dolsot) with the crispy white rice and fried egg. I love them both equally, it just depends what kind of mood I\\'m in...I will say that the Dolsot prepared dish is a bit more filling. \\n\\nIt\\'s a cute spot with seating in the back of the restaurant and additional garden seating. I do think it\\'s a little overpriced, at least for the cold Bibimbap at $10.00 per bowl and sometimes the portion size seems to fluctuate, but the taste is consistent and they do offer it for $8.00 as a lunch special which I do try to catch between 11:30am and 3:00pm Monday-Friday. \\n\\nService is always warm (there is not table service per se, but you order with the cashier and they deliver it to you at your seat when ready).  I love when I drop off my dirty plate to the pass and I hear the man behind the curtain shout out with a friendly and enthusiastic \"Thank you!\" It makes me smile every time!', u\"Really great bulgogi, ice tea is addictive.\\nI miss the almond encrusted corn dogs. Don't know why they took that off the menu\", u\"I was in the area and looking for a Korean restaurant, and thanks to Yelp I found about Hanki and decided to give it a try!\\n\\nThe decor and atmosphere was very casual and had more of a fast restaurant type of feel than a sit down experience. You ordered and paid at the front, then sat in the back. I ordered the vegetable bibimbap, which on the menu has a picture of it with a fried egg, but in reality comes with shredded egg and if you want a fried egg it is $1 extra. For $1, it was worth it to me, so I got it with the extra egg, though I don't know why the picture on the menu includes the egg if it isn't normally there.\\n\\nThe bibimbap itself was delicious. The vegetables were very fresh and I loved that they had multigrain rice and had the rice on the side so you can add as much or as little as you want. Too many places skim on the vegetables by putting in a lot of rice to pile up the bowl. The gochujang sauce was spicy and nice as well and the kimchi (ordered separately) didn't disappoint. The bibimbap did not come with banchan, however, was which a bit of a disappointment.\\n\\nI'd definitely come back for Korean food if I were in Brooklyn and craving it.\", u\"VERY exciting to get a Korean spot back in Park Slope, especially one that isn't gouging your eyes out in prices. Hanki is in fact the perfect antidote to that - a non pretentious, fair priced take out / casual dining place. \\n\\nThe portions are smaller than K-Town but at least most of the dishes cost $10 ~ $12, which is entirely reasonable. And the food is good! It's also your like only option in Park Slope so what're ya gonna do. I enjoyed the spicy pork, the japchae and the purple rice. I also enjoyed the big ol bottle of red chili paste that let me spice up my already decently spicy meal to my fire pleasure.\\n\\nWill definitely be back!\", u'Delicious Korean food. Enjoyed every single dish. Will return to try the other foods on the menu.', u\"I like to support new local small businesses, especially when they bring diversity into the neighborhood.  I am a huge fan of Korean food, I regularly go to ktown and flushing to have authentic korean bbq, soon dubu etc. I had such high hopes for this place but it disappointed me all 3x I've been here. Needless to say, there will not be a 4th visit.\\n\\nThe portion sizes of protein they give you is laughable.  Especially compared to the huge amount of rice that comes with it.  I've tried the beef, spicy pork and chicken.  The beef and spicy pork had decent flavoring but was drenched in oil. The chicken is less oily but also dry.  They chop up the meat into tiny dime size pieces and give you so little, I feel like I'm a toddler eating out of my high chair. \\n\\nI asked for kimchi today and they said they didn't have any.  HOW CAN A KOREAN RESTAURANT NOT HAVE KIMCHI. I'm done.  \\n\\nIf you've ever been to the food court at HMart, they are SPOT on for a fastfood spot thats no frills, great portion and authentic food that is made to order with no tipping required.  If only Hanki were like that, then I would be a frequent visitor since I live so close!\", u\"I'm glad this place had everyday in the title because it's so good, I want to eat here every day. Great food and great prices. The back patio is so relaxing\", u'What a cute little place for lunch! And the food was delicious. Myself and my bf shared the bulgogi bowl and the spicy pork set. The set came with the pork, purple rice, and japchae, while the bowl was simply bulgogi and rice. Everything was delicious, but our favorite was the pork, it was the perfect amount of spicy and had a really nice taste. The only downsides for us were the meat portions (we would have preferred more for the price, we payed about $35 for lunch for 2) and we wished there was some kind of sauce on the bowl, spicy sauce etc. They also have a lovely outdoor patio to eat, which is a plus. \\n\\nOverall, the food and ambiance were great, the price to portion ratio is lacking, but its still worth the trip.', u\"To-go review \\n\\nKalbi hot dog - the whole ensemble of all beef hot dog (moist and good snap), potato roll, pickles and a choice of chicken or beef (but we weren't asked choice so got chicken) which didn't add much. I think the hot dog with toppings alone and sauce was tasty!\\n\\nCorn dog - needs a sauce to go with it but the hot dog is tasty as mentioned and the crust wasn't as crispy but maybe it's bc we took it home?\\n\\nJap chae ($4) for small portion size but good taste!\\n\\nGalbi rolls - 2 huge egg rolls (thick skin) with bulgogi and cheese inside, comes with kimchi, and spicy (gochugang) sauce. Hubby liked a lot, I thought ok. \\n\\nGalbi set - reasonable amount of beef comes with purple rice (my fave!) 4 banchan (kimchi, spinach?, white radish (not spicy but a soy sweet, and pickled cucumber) was delish although I think the price is a little steep?\\n\\nCitron tea - I love yuzu but there wasn't enough flavor for me but a lot of rinds. \\n\\nNice to have a Korean option in the neighborhood!\", u\"Came to this hole in a wall on Saturday (6/10/17)  evening for a friend's birthday. We had one of the hanki sets- bulgogi, bulgogi rolls (apps), normal spice seafood tofu stew, spicy pork rice bowl. We were still hungry and quite pleased with how delicious the food turned out we went BACK for another hanki set(with japchae this time)- spicy chicken, and Korean styled ramen.\\n\\nWe thought the food was so good, it's definitely one of the better Korean joints in Brooklyn. Their tofu stew, beef, japchae, and multigrain rice was a favorite of ours. If we weren't so full, we would have definitely gotten a different kind of stew!\\n\\nThe service was good too, food was served quickly, and all questions answered! You order & pay up front, then head to the back and seat yourself (if dining in) and they'll bring the food to you when it's ready. When it's done you just drop off your dirty plates at the drop off window near by.\\n\\nThis is a bit pricier, but nothing drastic, the price is comparable to the price we've paid for other meals. I've definitely spent at least 10-20$ on meals which I've come to regret, so no complaints here!\\n\\nDef hit this spot if you're feeling too lazy to leave Brooklyn, but craving some Korean.\", u'I live in Manhattan but i go blooklyn for this restaurant.\\nLove this place alot! One of my favorite spot! Feels and tastes like in korea! (Im tipical korean lol)\\n\\nExcellent service, lots of food, good prices, bright atmosphere, and close to a nice neighborhood and park.\\n\\nGreat Korean restaurant! I love the services there. Lunch special really worth a try!\\n\\nunbeatable lunch specials, you get a ridiculous amount of food (enough to have leftovers)\\n- recommend: bulgogi hanki set, jabchae and\\nspicy pork hanki set\\n\\n- my go-to korean lunch spot in blooklyn \\n- quick attentive service\\n- reasonable price\\n- really enjoyed their assortment of complimentary side dishes as well', u'They make good Korean foods, very casual and easy to grab. My go-to-place when I want Korean for my dinner after work. Price is little bit above my expectation though.', u'Love this place! So glad to have a delicious Korean spot in the neighborhood. Everything was outstanding. We had the jap chae, the spicy chicken, and the egg roll appetizer was out of this world. Have already been back about 3 times since discovering it.', u\"Had a delicious lunch here with family. I was in a rush and the food came out very quickly, so I was surprised by the quality-it really tastes homemade. My husband loved the spicy pork and my picky son loved the Korean chicken soup. It's tasty and well seasoned and he had no idea it was healthy. My favorites were the crispy bulgogi rolls and kalbi hotdog. I thought it was a lot of food for the price. The ginger tea was really refreshing (and not too gingery), wish I knew the recipe.\\n\\nWhile we were waiting we got an amazing sample of bibim noodles and heard there were going to be more soups and gluten free options added to the menu soon.\", u'The food was very bland and overpriced , definately not worth it . Veggies & sauces were good but the rest of the food lacked flavor .', u\"Nice place! We had a lovely lunch at Hanki Everyday Korean. The staff are very welcoming and clearly eager to make the venture a success.  And a success it is: the dishes were all beautifully presented with several different items to enjoy. Loved the banchan items that came with the bulgogi and the jap chae was particularly great as well.\\n\\n4 stars because I do wish they offered a few more main choices. It's a small place but I don't think it impossible to add one or two more mains of interest. Also, it was recommend that we try the teas. The ginger was outrageously sweet - cloyingly, undrinkably so for our taste. I would prefer the option of an unsweetened tea, or at least some suggestion that these would be heavily sweetened teas.  \\n\\nIt is definitely on the pricier side for lunch options, but not so for Korean lunch options in general. There was a good deal of work into both the presentation and the preparation of the dishes, so I feel it was priced correctly for the quality of the offering.\\n\\nWe would happily return to Hanki Everyday Korean. Next time, we'll skip the tea and hold out for Kalbi, Korean Fried Chicken or another main alternative.\", u'They completely redesigned this place and now it looks awesome and matches the terrific food!', u\"The spicy pork bowl is very good and only $10. They put a few jalape\\xf1o slices on top, which was a little weird but I actually liked it. If you don't want it, you could easily just brush it off. This place is also cozy. I hope they stick around. Look at my mouth.\"], u'88.South Brooklyn Foundry': [u\"As a regular customer at The Family Store I knew I was in for something special when I stepped foot into SBF.\\nA friend & I came in for an early dinner. \\nFirst of all, do yourself a favor and order the chicken skins and the famous house burger. Damn!\\nThey were good! We also had the crab cake and watercress salad. Everything was top notch, beautiful atmosphere, funky music and warm friendly hospitality.  Who could ask for more?\\nI can't wait to return for brunch!\", u\"I love a good Eggs Benedict and this place does it so well. Everything is perfectly cooked and seasoned well. I got my owl with both ham and spinach and duck confit. The duck was good however didn't really miss it much, however, the HAM! Oh yes the Ham made its presence known and kept me wanting more. The hollandaise sauce is creamy and a little tart with a slight kick to it. Very filling and so worth it. \\n\\nThe bacon egg and cheese was delightful. The Egg was very soft and fluffy. Cheese melt to perfection. The bacon was on the chewier side which I wasn't too big of a fan of. The potatoes on the side seemed like maybe they were sitting out for awhile; it was very dry. \\n\\nAlso got the foundry fix which was super yummy. Lots and lots of whipped cream. Mmmmm\\n\\nI'd definitely return for brunch again. But you'll also definitely see me back for lunch!\", u\"For a long time I've waited for a place to come to Brooklyn with an original  style such as South Brooklyn foundry. I have been long awaiting their opening everyone was hyping it up and boy did it meet my expectations. Upon entering I was blown away by the ambience that they had designed the place with,  it was almost as if you had entered the 1920s it had such a rustic organic look to it with brick walls in the lighting fixtures everything from the bathroom to the stools were  handcrafted tables  I was blown away. The employees they had working there were so kind and welcoming you felt like you were dining in someone's home they have an incredible selection of beer and wine on tap. So let's talk about the food\\n\\n     The menu had so many interesting and unique twist of culinary cuisine I spent 20 minutes deciding on what I wanted to get. When I asked the waitress what's your favorite thing she said the burger and being an American classic I decided  to give it a shot , I mean the presentation was great  , I've eaten a lot of burgers in my day and it's hard for me to say that this is the best burger I've ever had but it most definitely was it was a handcrafted piece of art. \\n\\n   The portion was great it came with hand cut fries which were delicious cooked to perfection with the perfect amount of crunch. The burger, The second I bit into it the bread had the perfect amount of crunch   They had the perfect amount of pickles and their home smoked bacon was on believable the meat was so flavorful and so juicy I am very impressed with what I have eaten so far and I can only imagine that the rest of their cuisine will be just as amazing look forward to having more of there dishes.\", u\"I love this place! I came here today because my friend has been wanting to try this place for a while and has it bookmarked for weeks. Upon walking in you notice the wooden decor which is simple yet inviting there is a large mural of the streets and there's tables of different sizes to accommodate different parties, there is even a bar area with the different beers on a blackboard.. I ordered the Benedict with ham and my friend got the bacon egg and cheese I believe? His bacon egg and cheese was bomb! The scrambled egg was light and fluffy and reminded me of one of my favorite cafe in Hong Kong.. my decomposed eggs Benedict was out of this world! The poached egg was on top of toasted pieces of bread and a bed of potatoes  mixed with ham and hollandaise  sauce. I loved that it wasn't the traditional bread at the bottom with Canadian bacon in middle and egg on top.. this decomposed version worked really well together and I loved how the bread managed to stay crispy and delicious even after being drowned in hollandaise and the ketchup I put I got the first drink on the menu and my friend got something similar to a Bloody Mary .. I wasn't a fan of his spicy tomato drink (hence I never had a Bloody Mary before) but he loved it and I loved my cucumber mint drink (1st drink on the menu) brunch was kinda pricey with drinks, came out to be 25-30 per person. But I truly enjoyed my food and my drink so I will definitely be back, my friend and I are excited to try their dinner menu as well! \\n\\nService was wonderful and the bathroom soap dispenser made me laugh, I won't ruin the surprise so you will just have to go see for yourself!!\", u'I heard the place was an extension of the deli next door which is famous for it\\'s amazing recipes. We stopped by (a few times now) and the food is fantastic. I am in love with the duck ... and the salmon... and the burgers. The dishes are not just scrumptious - the quality of ingredients is excellent. My brother calls it \"celebration for the stomach\".\\nI love the laid back atmosphere and dedication of staff. Everyone just seem to love being a part of it.\\nSo glad this place is here now and judging by reaction of other guests - so is everyone else.', u\"Was looking for a brunch spot on yelp close to home because my husband friend from the military who he served 2 tours with came down to Brooklyn to visit us for the weekend and we wanted to introduced to him to some good food spots in Brooklyn. I was so glad I found this spot! The food was delicious and the staff was amazing. She was very attentive and she made sure we were taken care of the entire time we were there. Highly recommended and would come back again. It has a Mom and Pop shop feeling, it's family friendly, and it can accommodate a large party of maybe 6-8. It also has bar seating.\", u\"Let's just say they know what they're doing everything we ate was spot on....... excellent!  SO EXCITED we have a new great place to eat in Bay Ridge Bravo!! Came for Brunch can't wait to go for dinner. Small space so get there before it becomes impossible to get a seat!\", u\"We just came here for the second time today.  I had the French toast which was just so orgasmically delicious I would have sex with it if I could! My husband got the bacon & egg sandwich, and he cleaned his plate, which I've never seen him do before.  I tasted the egg, which was creamy and fluffy.  I can't comment on the bacon, as I don't eat meat.  The coffee is nice and they made me an iced coffee off-menu. \\nWe came for dinner last week and I had beet & black bean burger, which has a lovely flavor.  I don't usually enjoy potatoes, but I loved the fries.  My husband ordered the Foundry burger, and he loved it.  The cucumber mint cocktail is divine.\\nOne of the owners chatted with us during dinner and told us about the process of handcrafting all of the furniture, the story of the fence in the window that came from a family member's yard, and the story behind the Bay Ridge mural on the wall.\\nWith great food, great staff, superb cocktails, and beautiful decor, this place is definitely giving Brooklyn Beet Company a run for its money.\", u\"This place is a long overdue restaurant of Sam of the Family Store right next door.  Sam and the Family Store have been a great stable of the Bay Ridge scene.  The food is always fresh and innovative and we were never disappointed.  The only draw back was that it is always a take out joint.  Now no more.  The South Brooklyn Foundry has incorporated Sam's famous dishes like crab cakes ( which is all crab meat and very little bread crumbs). Meatballs to the newer additions like Fried Chicken skin and some main courses.  The food is paired off nicely with a good drink menu.  The place is intimate and great for early family dining or later romantic dinner.  A great place to meet up with friends for a drink and some nosh as well, it almost cater to all type of groups.  I really like this new additional to the neighborhood because this is a place that you can have small plates as well as lunch and dinner and not many places can be like this in the neighborhood.  I haven't try their brunch yet but I heard it will be their signature meal of the day soon.  Can't wait!!!\", u\"Four of us ordered different foods and none of us had even a single complaint. All of them were cooked perfectly. Well-seasoned, flavorful but not over spiced, and the portion was just right. Also, they definitely didn't go cheap with their wine. We always order from the family store and this was the first time we have been to their restaurant, it certainly did not disappointed us. For sure we gonna keep ordering from this place.\", u\"Had a wonderful dinner here tonight. Food and service were very good. So glad to have this gem right in my neighborhood. Started with the pork meatballs, salad and Salomon belly. All excellent but my favorite were the meatballs. Eggplant napoleon was very good and for entree we split the pulled pork with faro and Swiss chard. The owner insisted on offering us a complimentary dessert, it was cheesecake and it was amazing. What a wonderful place and I can't wait to go back for brunch.\", u\"If you're looking for a tasteful brunch this is the place to go! Our table ordered the Benedict bowl, Bacon egg and Cheese, and a Beet burger. What we were served was nothing less than brunch perfection! Everything was very fresh and beautifully presented. The industrial chic ambiance and decor make you feel like you're in a 1940's pub. The staff is friendly and outgoing and surprisingly quick considering this spot opened a week ago. I'm definitely coming back for dinner..and inviting friends! Best brunch in BayRidge!!\", u'Great neighborhood gem. Impressive cocktails..delicious meal (wife and I had the burger)...and friendly staff. What more could you ask for?  Loved it...Will definitely be back', u'Delicious fresh food cooked to perfection. Beautiful and comfortable decor, wonderful friendly service!  We had the crab cakes and they were the best I ever had! Delicious burger and awesome fried chicken. Will definitely be back!', u\"Friendly service and staff. Beautiful decor and very hip. I ordered a black bean beet burger and my husband ordered eggs toast and potatoes. The food took so long.... My burger was good but after waiting so long for it I didn't even want it anymore. The burger was falling apart, it needed a little something to hold it together. Overall a nice place for coffee and drinks! I wouldn't return for the food menu.\", u'We enjoyed the duck entree and the fried chicken entree.  The restaurant is comfortable and the service was great.  I look forward to trying their brunch one day.', u'Owned by my favorite Bay Ridge take-out store, The Family Store!The restaurant itself has such a cool atmosphere, from the burnt wood tables to the old school wallpaper photo on the wall. The burger was amazing and the wait staff was very attentive and friendly. Will definitely be a regular at this neighborhood place!', u'Astoundingly good. Great menu. Great execution. A worthy counterpart to the venerable Family Store, next door.', u'Absolutely love this place... brunch is amazing definitely the best in the neighborhood their burgers are to die for... the owner is a super nice guy... and again they have undisputedly the best burger in the neighborhood', u'So the place has a decent vibe and the food is ok and I would have rated them higher as it was their soft opening night but...  They screwed up both mine and my wife\\'s orders sending me the wrong thing completely and my wife\\'s dish cold (fried chicken). We had to wait for a brand new order after we waited for the first order. Waitress and hostess apologized profusely and said something about taking care of drinks/meal  etc. Great!  So the bill came and not a shred of anything off of it - as if we had a great meal with no hiccups. I am not one to argue so we paid and left, however won\\'t be coming back - we were not \"blown away\" by the food to make up for the fact that ultimately they did not care enough to do anything about a pretty big screw up. Little care does go a long way especially with so much competition around.'], u'65.Lan Ting Hotpot BBQ': [u\"Came here for dinner at 6:30 pm. When I entered, I was seated right away in the basement.\\n\\nI ordered their beef tail and bone soup. I found out that there are beef tail bones in the broth. I then ordered their beef, lamb, pork, chicken gizzard, sausage, pork waist, fried dough, cauliflower, potato, pumpkin, taro, Fuzhou fish balls, fried tofu skin, shrimp paste, and konjac knots. The food is fresh, when they bring out the meats, there is still blood dripping out of it.\\n\\nThe waiters come over to scoop the scum that builds up from time to time. Whenever I'm out of food, they will ask me if I want to order more. The place is seen playing music in the background.\\n\\nThe only thing that disturbs me from the good service was that I was seated next to a group with two children who keeps crying. However, I give the place 5 stars for their service.\\n\\nI was also served completemenary appetizers of kimchi, pickled seaweed, and cold chicken feet. When I am done, I was also served complementary dessert of jelly in rose water. Originally, I also wanted to order their taiwanese crepes, but seeing it that it will fill me up easily, I chose not to order it.\", u'We tried to come here for hotpot without a reservation once and that was a fail! The wait was so long! So definitely make a reservation!!!\\n\\nFinally came here after making reservations and we sat downstairs. Its a pretty spacious restaurant. The design of the restuarant is alittle confusing (lots of fruity colors mixed w dark colors..). One unisex bathroom downstairs.\\n\\nTheir menus have pictures (yay!) and i always get spicy soup base. The spicy soup base here is actually spicy so i loved it! My gf got the pig bone base which she said wasnt much taste.\\n\\nThe sauce station is awkwardly located where the TV area is. And they didnt really have a signature sauce. They did have a hot pot sauce but it was thick and only had soy sauce, chili oil or sesame oil to thin it out. So we were not a fan of the sauce station and thats probably my only complaint.\\n\\nThe food was pretty fresh, and small portioned since its all u can eat, assuming ull order more.\\n\\nThe staff mainly spoke mandarin, and some english. So communication took some time.\\n\\nOverall, i would come back for hot pot. But definitely will make reservations!', u\"For AYCE hot pot, Lan Ting is pretty up there. If you arrive at prime dine time or even a little later than that, the wait can be long. Since it's AYCE, everyone is trying to eat their money's worth. You put your name down with the hostess and she'll give you a number to hold onto. Once your table is ready she'll call your number.\\n\\nFor $22/person, you get to choose your own personal soup base, as much meat, seafood, dumplings, noodles, and veggies as you want, and access to the unlimited sauce bar. The variety of hot pot goodies may not be as diverse as other hot pot places, but at least they have all the basics - sliced meat, fish balls, etc. They don't have my ultimate favorite, fish ball stuffed with roe, but the slippery shrimp paste and fish tofu sufficed. \\n\\nIf there's one thing to know about me, it's that I will never say no to sauce. Lan Ting has an impressive spread of sauces, which you can customize to fit your taste. I like the mix of Chinese BBQ sauce, sesame oil, scallions, cilantro, and raw minced garlic.\\n\\nThis is a Chinese-run establishment, so knowing how to speak either Cantonese or Mandarin is helpful. Our waitress spoke to me in Mandarin and some broken English. While I understood her, I don't speak Mandarin well so I resorted to a lot of pointing, which was fine. \\n\\nIf you're looking for an AYCE hotpot place, look no further! Lan Ting is easy on the wallet and has a good spread. The extensive sauce bar is also a plus!\", u\"How much can you expect at an AYCE hotpot place? Not a lot. This place offered more than my expectations. \\n\\nThe staff here gives professional and attentive service. I had noticed the host was super polite while dealing with rude encounters from incoming guests. I did not have a reservation and he gave us an accurate waiting time and got us seated shortly. There are two floors to this place but still compacted with basic vents. \\n\\nThe female server was friendly. She was quite attentive and helpful in making sure we received what we had ordered. The food arrives really fast and when it didn't, she would reassure that it was coming. She made sure there were no foam layers in our soups. She told us about the discounts and lunch specials that was currently offered. \\n\\nTheir menu had many typos and scientific verbiage for the food items. They have my favorite fried tofu skin rolls and the shrimp slip is really good. Huge cherrystone clams as part of their AYCE selection. I like their sauce dish options as well.\", u\"The service here was spectacular!!! It's one of the better AYCE hot pot around the area. My friend and j arrived and was seated within 5 minutes. The place has very nice interior decoration.\\nPros: \\nService was SUPER fast and good. We sat down, and started ordering, as we were still talking to the waitress, the soup base(our individual pots) were already on our table. As soon as the waitress was done taking the order, all the food were already on the table! TALK ABOUT SPEED. And they were also very friendly.\\nThey have a very complete and wide range of sauces that you can make yourself. \\nThe soup base that I had was really good.\\nAt the end of the meal, we were given wet wipes, gum and free ice cream!\\nCon: It was getting kind of chilly as we were eating maybe because we were sitting too close to the blasting AC. \\nOverall, a very pleasant experience.\", u\"Love theirs smiles! They are joyfully serving their customers. \\n\\nMy favorite part about eating here is that the waiting staff are very friendly. They are different from most Chinese restaurants, where most wait staff are impatient and cold. It's just so pleasant to eat here. The wait staff are intensive and always have smiles on. They kept refill out pots and come by our table every now and then to see if we need more food. While we were waiting for our table they served us freshly made cucumber juice. Give 5 stars just for the service! \\n\\nThe inside of the restaurant is not roomy, but the layout of it is very cozy. Oh, the bathroom is cleaner than most Asian restaurants.\", u'The staff here are so friendly and sweet, feel so welcomed:) very nice place to spend time with friends or family. The first floor looks small but there additional seats available down the basement. Where they have karaoke as well(in the open area though).had great time here, will definitely come back to try their BBQ', u\"Fantastic all you can eat hotspot / BBQ place! Service is fantastic! Every time we needed something , there's someone there to help. The soup base was flavorful and the meat and veggies are fresh, there's decent sauce choices ( they have A1 steak sauce). I would recommend this place as a go to place to eat! In the end the waiter offered free ice cream which is pretty nice of them! I would definitely recommend this place to family and friends!\", u\"Lan Ting Hotpot is AYCE hotpot. I reserved for a table of 6 on a Wednesday and was running late. They sat my party after most of them arrived. I was a bit fool'd by the cute pots.. it's not an actual pot and it was quite small compare to the other hotpot places. Anywhos they have a pretty decent amount of selections for AYCE but of course if you want certain types of seafoods and etc there would be additional charge. Because the pots were so small, the server literally refilled our soup base about 5-6 times which by then you can barely taste your soup base. The waiters were pretty friendly. I think its worth a try but wont be a place that I would go back to often for AYCE hotpot especially since there are so many other hotpot places around the area.\", u\"our host Velva was super attentive as well as the other servers. Sis rsvp'd for 7 people for a sunday night at 7:30 for mamabears birthday and they had so much patience for the elderlies. they were super accommodating to our needs and ingredients were pretty fresh; even the picky parental units and god parents approved. haha on a person's exact day of their birthday they offer free meal for the person; even though mama's bday celebration was early they still came out with ice cream and candle and played the happy birthday song on their ktv like projector; they were playing a lot of adele tonight haha no complaints. love the decor as well. place is fairly new and with a very bubbly and lovey staff. they also seem to have a basement for more seats? i didn't check it out- though the place is a cozier fit- the seating was still very comfortable. it's also the little things; they noticed my sis was preggo and suggested she sit outside instead of inside booth seat; when they pour more soup for us they use one hand to cover us to make sure us doesn't splash at us- consistently in their action. i've been to fair amount of hot pot places; i just felt like they had an extra touch of hospitality and felt like it is so commendable. xoxo\", u\"I've been to most all you can eat hot pot places in New York and Lan Ting definitely stands out as one of the best (or simply the best on my current list). When it comes to AYCE hot pot, I always look at 4 things - the broths, the dipping sauces, the freshness of ingredients, and the variety of ingredients. \\n\\nStarting with the broth - there are different types and I tried the spicy one as well as the original pork bone one. I liked both. Although the broths at Lan Ting are not significantly better than other good places', I'd say they are all very decent.\\n\\nI love some of the special dipping sauces that you cannot normally get from other hot pot places, like the mushroom one and the green pepper one. I do hope the sesame paste could be a little less thick though. \\n\\nWhat makes Lan Ting my favorite is the freshness and the variety of the ingredients. The cut of the fatty beef is spot on and the crispy pork tastes very good (yes you can eat it directly too). Seafood is very fresh. To my surprise, unlike other places, the shrimp spread (\\u867e\\u6ed1) and crispy tofu skin (\\u54cd\\u94c3) are included the in the AYCE menu here. Also, my girlfriend really likes the Taiwanese pancake (\\u53f0\\u6e7e\\u624b\\u6293\\u997c).\\n\\nBesides food itself, the service is also top notch. Special thanks to \\u963f\\u7b11, who's always so attentive and sincere.\\n\\nWe came all the way from flushing to sunset park for Lan Ting cuz it's worth the drive. Have been here twice already and will definitely come back often.\", u'I called in for a reservation because  AYCE hotpot places can become packed with up to an hour wait. This place has two levels, nice decor and seems very clean. We were seated immediately and placed our order.\\n\\nThe sauce bar is very complete with lots of options. They have individual hot pots for each person with lots of varieties of bases. The food was delicious and the food came out fast. They had a good variety of items from meat to seafood to vegetables. They were very attentive when it came to refilling the pots with water and taking the orders. Just be careful because you can burn the inside of your mouth like I did!\\n\\nOverall, had a good time.', u'I will never come back. They were busy and they gave me a ticket and I asked the hostess how long i gonna wait,they told me only take 30 mins.But I waited about one hour! So I ask them again, they told me my table was ready. But I saw they seat a group of people instead of my friend and me. And they supposed behind us!So I sak they why,they said cause they are big family,  and the table is for big party! Complete wasting my time! And the 2 hostess had a bad attitude! For your business, you should change your stuff!', u\"Came here at the beginning of this month to celebrate my lil bro birthday. My cousin treated us here and gave a really generous tip I heard. Anyways, since one of my bestie lives around the block, I saw this place renovating before it ever opened for business and knew I had to go try it. My bestie went here without me to try and said the food was so so and told me to not bother going. however, I am head strong and like to be my own judge.  Some of the points he told me does hold true, however, I have a different opinion than him. I actually give this establishment 3.5 stars but since there are no half star ratings so they get 4 stars. Yelp should start adding half star ratings into their system. \\n\\nThe inside decor is contemporary yet small. Looks like downstairs have more. But didn't go look to see what was there. Maybe a party room? Karaoke? Not sure. Upstairs is where we ate at. It rain the day we went there. The waitress asked if I wanted to place my umbrella in the outside pail, I declined and said I wanted it next to me. They seemed okay with it although hesitate. The staff was friendly and even came to ask us how we know of the place and what we thought of our meal. Maybe cause they overheard that I am a yelp reviewer. But I did enjoy the friendly chitchat. Overall service however needs some improvement hence they lost one star for that. When my soup was overflowing with oil from the meats, servers didn't come over to remove the foam layer. Other places like Laojie (\\u8001\\u8857) does come to check often and remove; and 99 flavor taste provides the scooper and pail for you to do yourself and does sometime do it for you too. This place should at least provide that if they can't be attentive to remove for the customer. In addition, the servers only came to remove after they over heard us talking about it. I even did a test to see if they would do it without me asking. Well they failed that test. Next came the soup base, as my bestie complained to me that one of the things he didn't like about this establishment was that the soup base is not flavorful like 99 flavor taste. He was right. Their soup base is a little lacking. In addition their spicy soup base that my cousin order is way too spicy. They probably should offer mild spicy and provide additional spicy sauce on the side for the customer. That would be a better way to do it. The sauces they had was very nicely presented, however they were not abundant like 99 flavor taste and Hangout 58. They should provide more varieties. But I did enjoy their own herb created sauces. That was genius! The food looked and tasted fresh. My favorite was their tofu skin rolls. They presented it very well in rolls while other places presents it in big slice pieces. I prefer the roll presentation. Taste better and easier to cook in the hotpot. So that was my favorite of all the foods offered. Overall it's a very basic hotpot place. Would I come again, probably. \\n\\nP.S. I did have stomach pain and had to use the bathroom after eating. But I am not sure if it's from the food at this place as I do have a sensitive stomach. As I did see the food looked fresh, I will not hold it against this place. But if I eat here a second time and have stomach pain then I would know it's link to this establishment. So no star deduction for that. Only deduction for service and for lack of new items offered due to it being relatively new (see my tip regarding lack of new items offered).\", u\"THEIR SERVICE IS SO GOOD I WOULD COME HERE JUST FOR THEIR SERVICE ALONE HONESTLY. We came in at 11 and it was pretty empty but the waiters were still very attentive and accommodating. The restaurant itself is super pretty/ very classy. Tables are really big and the seats are cushioned so they're really comfy, especially for hotpot. THE FOOD IS BOMB AS WELL. They give you mussels and full sized clams here!!!! They're huge, and I feel like it's so much more worth than other places. ALSO free icecream at the end :')\", u\"I came here with a big group and all of us can say that we enjoyed having hotpot here. This is one of the better AYCE hot pot spots around the 8th Ave area. \\n\\nSomething that makes this place stand out from other hot pot spots is that their hot pots are covered with decorated Chinese porcelain. This made their food taste that much better ;). The soup bases come with mushrooms and other miscellaneous ingredients that gives it a homemade feel. A plate of free appetizers (chicken feet, edamame, seaweed salad) is also served before the soup and other stuff gets to the table. The ingredients that they serve here are very fresh. Their fatty beef is the perfect cut and has the perfect thinness, but one complaint I have is that they did not bring out enough. We ordered other things from the menu and didn't get the fatty beef until 30 mins into the dinner. The veggies and frozen items came out fast. The first plate of fatty beef was gone in a second and they would not send out another plate for another 20 minutes. I made sure to emphasize that we wanted more than 1 plate, but they didn't get the message. This won't stop me from coming here because they do have a good selection of items to choose from. One unique item they have here is the slippery shrimp (I know, funny name. Even my friends and I laughed every time I ordered it). It is essentially shrimp paste and is delicious. We probably had at least 6 servings of that. They also have my favorite 3 second fried tofu skin. Many places charge extra for this. To end the meal, they give a scoop of ice cream for free. The total per person without tax and tip is about $22, which isn't too bad. \\n\\nI will definitely be coming back and just a warning for the people of Lan Ting Hot Pot: I am only ordering beef the next time I come :p\", u\"Ok, I'm typically not a fan of all you can eat hotpot since quality in such places is usually not very good. But this place actually got pretty nice stuff for very reasonable price. The soup base is a bit bland and could improve a bit, but otherwise great experience.\", u'Finally came here on a weekday later in the evening,  when we walked in we were greeted right away. Not a huge hotpot place so may have to wait on the weekend.\\n\\nOverall rating \\nsoup base 3/5\\nMeat quality 3/5\\nService/3.5 /5 \\nVariety on menu 3.5/5\\n\\nSo this is your average hotpot spot nothing amazing for soup base.\\n\\nMUST TRY THE SLIPPING SHRIMP PASTE! So good!', u\"Really liked this place. I thought it was better than some other AYCE places in flushing.  the The soup base lacked some flavor and everything else was very fresh with the exception of seafood but that's a given in all AYCE places. The big clams were fresh though and it was part of the menu w/no extra charge. I loved the fatty beef. I've learned fatty feed at some places have weird taste although still fresh not sure if it is the cut. This place was great for me, I only wished they offered pig belly.\", u\"Good friendly staff,  foods are very typical hotpot stuff you can prepare at home.  Soup base was very weak.  My herbal soup base had no Herbal flavor at all.  Bone base also bland. Don't think ill go back.  Mr hot pot is still the best.\"], u'68.SUGARCANE Raw Bar Grill': [u\"Omg, this place is amazing!! Kudos the the article I read when I was trying to find the best new places in Brooklyn, because they got it spot on with Sugarcane Raw Bar Grill. \\n\\nI'm always not sure how many dishes to get at a tapas style place, so I asked two servers before ordering. One said one per person (seemed like too little) and the other said three per person (seemed like too many). Luckily, I already had my heart set on trying four (yes, I did have someone with me), so I arrived at a happy compromise between the two. \\n\\nBefore we get to the tapas though, I also got a rum 'n' bramble, which was honestly one of the best cocktails I've ever had. I'm not a fan of very strong tasting drinks and this was the perfect mix of sweet and smooth with a nice subtle hit of alcohol at the end. The server said it contained blackberry sorbet...no wonder it was such a treat! \\n\\nFinally, onto the food! We started with the goat cheese croquettes, which were absolutely divine, especially if you love goat cheese as much as I do. Crispy exterior with melt-in-your-mouth cheesy goodness. The guava sauce that came with it gave them a nice sweet finish. I'm still thinking about them today.\\n\\nNext up were the soy and orange brussel sprouts. I've never had this combination of flavors before and they worked very nicely to combat the bitterness of the sprouts. My one issue was that the sauce pooled a bit at the bottom of the bowl, so I had to swirl it around a bit cause the more sauce the better!\\n\\nThe bacon wrapped dates were fantastic too! If you eat one by itself, it does feel quite heavy, but amazingly, the mayonnaise sauce it comes with gives it a light acidic lift. Really the perfect bite. I didn't really taste the manchego cheese, but you don't really need that when you have sausage, dates, and bacon together.\\n\\nAnd finally, the duck waffle was the grand finale. The duck leg and egg were decent, but to me, the real star of the show was the waffle and its accompanying maple syrup. I don't even know why it was so delicious, but it was and I could not stop eating it. There was something about the maple syrup and the way the waffle just perfectly soaked it up. Just do yourself a favor and try it.\\n\\nTurns out that four tapas were enough! I was a bit too full for dessert, but I'm going to leave some room for that the next time I come here. Definitely check Sugarcane out if you like good food and drink and are ok with splurging just a little.\", u'Great place with amazing drinks, fun vibe and delicious food, however the service was awful. It took 20 min for someone to come to our table to take our order and bring us water and drinks. Then they forgot about the drinks and messed up our food order. Took another 15 minutes at the end to find our waiter to get the bill. When the bill finally came it was wrong so had to send it back. Ended up just paying cash as to not waste more time with credit card machine. \\n\\nThe place is enjoyable with beautiful decor, but the staff was all over the place and needs to get more organized because bad customer service can unfortunately ruin a great dining experience.', u\"Sugarcane has just opened in Dumbo and wow were we blow away. I gave this spot five stars, which I rarely do, so not sure I need to write much else, but read on.\\n\\nLet's start with the food. Food quality is just off the charts with an amazing variety of dishes coming from a combination of three kitchens: grill, raw bar and wood fire stove. While I'm not Gordon Ramsay, it seemed to me that the food was prepared fresh. I didn't encounter a dish which I could say as defrosted from the frozen food section nor microwaved. I was especially impressed with the bacon wrapped dates (the dates are mixed with manchego and Portuguese sausage), the citrus Brussels sprouts we're excellent and unexpected (I never thought to make that combination), while the chimmicuri skirt steak and sweet potatoes almost make a meal on their own, hearty and delicious. Dessert options were equally impressive and while I want to say the Nutella sundae ruled the way, their take on dulce de leche was amazing.\\n\\nMy only regret was that my stomach was too small to try everything. I'll be back and I recommend you take a trip to try it out!\", u'Came here on the soft opening night and the food and service was superb. The manager personally greeted our table and we had amazing drinks and food. The menu is very diverse and I never spring for dessert but decided to go for the nutella sundae which I am so glad I did because it was awesome. The vibe in here is really cool too. Awesome music and the bar gets busy. Seems like it would be a great place for events as well!', u'Awesome Raw Bar, Open Fire Grill , traditional kitchen, some Oriental and southern American... Global influence kitchen we could say! Amazing atmosphere ! Excellent location! Great staff! Very friendly all employees!\\nFood presentation and quality is wonderful!\\nVery informative & kind staff. Great choice of drinks! Good Luck !\\nWe here during soft opening of business and you guys doing just fine and organized ! Keep doing great job! Will be back with friends and family!\\nRecommending to speak to great waiter Jamal, thank you young man:)', u'It started with the intriguing menu we read about in the New York Times and the location we love in dumbo but this fun expansive space exceeded on all counts - first we got a Saturday night reservation at 8pm - kinda shocking for somewhere new in trendy Bklyn then we were 40 minutes late and NO attitude or problem at all in Fact the lovey hostess staff actually showed us 3 tables to choose\\nFrom! Then they acknowledged that I had said it was our anniversary and it just got better and better - lovely cocktails and attentive waiters and managers, two of whom worked the room like gracious hosts and added charm and real help in moving courses along and offering menu faves- we had crudo first - scallop and fluke lovely salty citrusy and simple followed by outstanding plump sweet dates wrapped in savory bacon - the right proportion of crunch and salt to soft and sweet - next yummy shishito peppers - crackling spiced and nice. For our main course Korean short ribs again a great spice balance and succulent meat accompanied by Mexican corn - aesthetically pleasing presentation of cob and kernels and flavorful as could be! For dessert Nutella sundae with cracker jacks - this was inventive, fun nostalgia  in a bowl - delicious perfectly portioned we were satisfied not stuffed and had so much fun thanks to a room of\\nHappy people - acoustics where you could hear nice music and have conversations and cool kitchen shows going on all around you - there\\'s a sushi bar grill and kitchen to watch. Already complimented the truly lovely caring staff - they are also dressed really well! So much Attention to detail! Finale? Everyone during these first opening weeks receives 25% reduction on bill as they \"work\\nOut kinks\" well that was just so appreciated especially as there were no kinks\\nTo speak of during this highly enjoyable evening!', u\"I'd really like to keep this to myself, but it wouldn't be fair to this place. Great menu and wonderfully executed food and cocktails; friendly, efficient and knowledgeable staff;  everything perfectly orchestrated. First visit--but will return!\", u'Everything was great. The food the way it was presented to us  it was very nice I like it. I will defiantly come back soon', u\"Went for the first time to the Miami location and fell in love with this place so of course when it opened I had to come. Everything was amazing, staff was very friendly, love the concept of this place and the food was incredible. Get the balsamic strawberry cocktail you won't regret it\", u\"This place will dazzle and overwhelm you with its beauty energy amazing food and top notch service.   \\nI thought you had to go to vegas or Miami or that far away island manhattan to get this experience.   \\nThe surroundings/view are breath-taking.    But equally impressive is the customer service starting with the very greeting.   \\nThe food is so diverse and each dish from the banging soup to the melt in your mouth crudo are prepared and executed with such elegance!    The food rocks!    You're gonna spend a small penny here but unlike other fancy shmancy places you'll leave here thrilled.   Super fun joint!     Amazing cocktails!   Can't wait to go back!\", u\"The food here is amazing. Seriously can't say enough good things. The menu is diverse - we could come here 5 times and not get tired of it. The must-try dishes are the bacon wrapped dates and duck waffle. The squid is also surprisingly good. The staff is friendly, ambiance is fun and lively. Unique location, it's in a waterfront park in a civil war area coffee warehouse. We will definitely be coming back!\", u'Already dined there twice with the fam and friends. Great service and great food! Favorite new restaurant in the neighborhood.', u'Excellent restaurant and service. Went for bone marrow, but we were told it was sold out. Server, Jordan, talked to the chef and after a bit, out came two orders. Perfect ending to an incredible experience. Food and drinks were as good as Sugarcane in Miami.', u'Great food like the Miami location and the staff was attentive and friendly. Def recommend!!', u\"I use to frequent the restaurant in Miami and was so happy to hear they were opening here. Once I got the email I made a reservation right away. We celebrated a friends birthday. From the moment we walked in we were greeted warmly. Jordan our waiter was knowledgeable and made sure to check in on us after each plate was served. We like to get several plates to taste a little of everything. I believe it's the best way to eat here. A must are the bacon wrapped dates, goat cheese croquetas, Brussels sprouts, scallop crudo, skirt steak,chicken thigh and without a doubt the duck waffles. We also tried the wagyu roll, crispy potatoes and ceviche which were great. We ended with all 3 of the desserts offered and they were delicious my personal favorite was the torrejas which I recommended to save room for as its the best way to close an amazing dinning experience. I look forward to celebrating and dining here frequently. Thank you for coming to New York we wish you the best and count on our continued support.\", u\"New to the neighborhood and couldn't be happier to have them. Seated immediately with our reservation ... super friendly service right off the bat. All of the food was great, really really spot on. Fresh, seasoned perfectly, seasonal ingredients, fantastic. Thank you ... can't wait to be back.\", u\"Had the opportunity to go to their soft opening last Thursday and what an amazing addition to Brooklyn and New York.  Sugarcane originated in Miami, went to Vegas and landed at the Tobacco Warehouse.   And New Yorkers and Dumboites could not be luckier.   We took a graze of the full menu and can't begin to tell you where to begin.   There are three parts of the menu and each has their own station.  The raw bar was incredible with the different sushi treats we had.  We had the scallop, torched hamachi and the crunchy tuna.  While all were incredible with really fresh fish and nice flavors, the scallop with apple and truffle was a stand out.   We moved to the small plates and had the shishito peppers; cauliflower, the Key West Smoked Fish with tostones and pig ear pad Thai.   Don't be freaked by the pig ear.  It was the highlight of the set for me, but everyone of the others will be returned to, often.  From the grill we had the skirt steak, but can tell you next time, based on how well the flavors were developed I'll return to this station often.   The best part of all of this is the prices are reasonable, the proportions the right size for sharing and the vibe in this place is very Miami.  The chef, owner Timon was ever present and from meeting him it is clear where the flavor and feel of this place comes from - he's passionate, warm and welcoming.   Lastly I have to say the service for day 3 was absolutely spot on.   The runners knew the dishes, the staff knew the menu and were attentive and made you feel like you were not in an NY restaurant.  Yeah for another awesome place in Dumbo!\"], u'132.Bricolage': [u'Vit person here. Food was very well made. You can see them preparing everything fresh from your seat in the main dining room. Ambiance is beautiful and service is super friendly.\\nI ordered ch gi\\xf2 (crispy imperial rolls) which were freshly fried and delicious. Their nc mm dipping sauce was really good too (something hard to get right in a lot of restaurants) and ph g\\xe0 (chicken soup) which was very light and tasty. Reminded me of homemade style Pho more than restaurant style. \\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend this place to friends and dine here again.', u'Just a quick note, this is definitely not your typical Vietnamese restaurant, so if that\\'s what you\\'re expecting, look for something else. \\n\\nSo, the good: \\nThe decor/ambiance is awesome here. It is such an adorable little place with a nice outdoor area in the back. There is an open kitchen (good and bad thing, will explain in a bit) so you can see everything going on while they prepare your food. The service was great too. \\n\\nThe bad: \\nWe ordered a few appetizers; summer rolls, Vietnamese crepe, 3 of the \"cup-o-pho\", sweet corn, and spicy pig ear. \\n\\nThe food came out very slowly. The spicy pig ear and summer rolls were good. The crepe though, was way overcooked. About a third of it was burnt and the edges were black. The sweet corn was actually incredibly salty. We each had a bite and unfortunately had to send it back since none of us could eat it. The server brought it back to the kitchen and one of the cooks (?) in the back took it and threw it. Literally, threw the bowl... Again, open kitchen so everyone could see. A little while later, we heard some clattering in the back and my friend said the same guy was just throwing things in the kitchen, not sure why though. Anyway, the server was very nice about it and took it off the bill. The cup-o-pho was okay. They use chicken broth, so it was like a nice little cup of chicken noodle soup.\\n\\nFor what we got, this place is seriously overpriced. $8 each cup-o-pho, a few pieces of pig ear was $5, summer rolls was $10, $18 for the crepe, and it would have been $9 for the corn... \\n\\nI personally wouldn\\'t come here again from our experience. This place does do quite a twist on Vietnamese food, but I would recommend just going to your normal place for your fixing of pho or Viet dishes.', u'Awful.\\n\\n- Waited 15 minutes to have our order taken\\n- Waited an hour to get our food\\n- My order was wrong (warned server of allergy -- still had ingredient that I am allergic to)\\n- My partner\\'s order was wrong (asked for a customization -- didn\\'t happen)\\n- My food was cold & WAY overcooked\\n- My partner\\'s food was watery & mediocre\\n- Despite all of this, was overcharged for a menu item I didn\\'t order\\n- Even after overcharge was fixed, the item I ordered was higher on the bill than on the menu price because the \"menu was wrong\"', u'Nice restaurant but horrible customer service. Came here with my wife on our two year anniversary for a drink. We wanted to sit outside in their nice backyard. They refused because there was rain in the forecast, despite the fact that several parties were already seated outside. We said it would be fine and we could carry our drinks back to the bar if it started raining and they still refused (the place was pretty empty it was a Tuesday night).\\n\\nWe went to the bar down the street and got seated outside :)', u\"Sometimes all you need in life is a really good duck bahn mi. I recently--like yesterday--came here after the best hour-long massage at D'mai Urban Spa. You'd think I would've been smart and ordered something healthy, like the guy sitting solo at a nearby table who happily ate his shrimp spring rolls quickly. But no! I saw duck confit and wanted something deliciously fatty and decadent. \\n\\nAnd it had every component that I'd been craving the day earlier. Sweet and spicy. The baguette was fresh and soft. Good amount of veggies, not enough duck meat or spicy mayo for me. I ate it in a flash and washed it down with a fine glass of Sauvignon Blanc--my go-to white wine when I don't know what else to order.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I couldn't sample the cocktails here because they don't serve them at lunch. Probably better for my situation since that meant I couldn't make my fat and lazy spa day, even fatter and even lazier with an indulgent cocktail.\\n\\nI also messed up and sat inside instead of indulging the beautiful, serene backyard. Talk about urban oasis meets comfort, in a Vietnamese-inspired way.\", u\"The food was amazing and the atmosphere lovely. \\n\\nThe restaurant was full when we got here around 10pm and it looks like they had been all night. I think that was why we had a couple of issues with delays. Our appetizer took forever to come out. Fortunately the cocktails came out on time so we enjoyed them while we waited. The staff was very apologetic for the delay and the papaya salad was delicious. Really fresh and crunchy with lovely dressing. \\n\\nWe ordered the branzino and the steak thinking that we would share them. I am thankful we had that plan as the fish came out a full 10-15 minutes before the steak. Again the staff was very apologetic. They actually ended up comping the salad and giving us two madeiras to say sorry. We enjoyed the madieras and, based on how our evening was going, we weren't too bothered by the delays but it was very noticeable. \\n\\nThe food was such high quality that I woke up the morning after thinking that I really wanted to go back. Very characteristic of Vietnamese food but higher end and less standard than your usual buns. Really good! Would definitely recommend and hope that the service issues we encountered won't happen to you.\", u'When I read about the owners of Slanted door opening a branch here in Park Slope, I was super excited to be able to try their food without having to fly to SF. Bricolage is a gastropub so I knew going in this was going to be vietnamese fusion, food wise and price wise. It\\'s a cute (small) place with a patio out back for those not afraid of mosquitos. We opted to sit inside.\\n\\nI came here for brunch with some friends and we didn\\'t have to wait for a table, so we\\'re off to a great start. The server was friendly, answered our questions adequately and we didn\\'t feel rushed. We ended up getting the Breakfast Veg crepe, Unshaking beef & fried egg, Niman ranch pork belly hash and the fried chicken & waffle.\\n\\nSurprisingly the dish that we all liked the most was the \"Banh xeo\" vegetarian crepe. It was flavor nicely and loaded with mushrooms. \\nThe unshaking beef was ok. A tad tough and didn\\'t taste like anything special. \\nThe Ranch Pork belly hash was way too salty for me and I like salty food!\\nThe fried chicken & waffle was too dry. The waffle was good, the chicken not so much.\\n\\nOverall, this place didn\\'t do it for me. I\\'ve only been here for Brunch and this is a 3.5 star for me. Maybe it was the hype that cause me to have too much expectation? Maybe I ordered the wrong food or maybe I need to come back for dinner instead? Too many maybes so \"MAYBE\" I would come back another time if some of my other friends want to try it.', u'This is a nice restaurant with a nice atmosphere. The service is very friendly and we had a good time here. The pho ga is different from your typical pho ga from traditional Vietnamese restaurants. I actually prefer the traditional Vietnamese pho over this. The iced coffee was great. I will be coming back to try the other dishes.', u\"This spot is so cute. Go during the summer and secure a spot in the garden in the back! It is the perfect date spot. Very romantic and intimate. Greenery and lights. \\n\\nThe food is also amazing! I have had lunch and dinner there and everything was great. Once the staff also recommended a amber/orange wine which was delightful. The pork chop is maybe one of the best I've had. It was tender and juicy. \\n\\nThe B\\xfan b\\xf2 Hu (only on the lunch menu, I think) was out of these world. People need to start ordering it. It is similar to pho but so underrated! Very complex and flavorful broth. \\n\\nNever tried the cocktails but they look so yummy. Will try that next time!\", u\"I've only eaten here once but everything we ordered was really well prepared and delicious. We sat in the back garden though I also really like their bar.\", u\"I'm a sucker for a nice outdoor patio, and as soon as the temperature hits 70 I'm there. The patio is full of lush plants and mismatching chairs, benches and tables that gives this space a really unique feel. Perfect for catching up with girlfriends or a date night.\\nI've been here twice, once for drinks on the patio, and once for dinner inside, both beautiful spaces!! \\nFor dinner, we chose a bunch of plates to share:\\nThe Brussels sprouts were great, the Imperial roll was excellent and so was the beef curry.\\nThe only thing I wouldn't recommend is the rib appetizer.. There was a lot of effort for a little meat on the bones.\", u\"Actual rating: 4.5 stars\\n\\nI've been to Slanted Door on multiple occasions and I have to admit, Bricolage is definitely superior here. Yes, you can get more authentic Vietnamese food for cheaper but Bricolage is great for what it is - a trendy Brooklyn restaurant.\\n\\nHere is what you need to know:\\n1. The back patio is one of the greatest places to have a meal. Highly recommended.\\n2. Share everything with your friends/crew. Especially the banh xeo. It's one of the better one that I've had in NYC.\\n3, Order a cocktail. They are so well made.\\n4. Service is all right. Pretty standard for New York.\\n5. Vibes are great.\\n6. I would stick to parties of four or less. This is not the ideal spot for large groups.\\n7. If you're looking for 100% authentic Vietnamese food, this is not the spot. If you're looking for good food, come here.\\n\\nI thoroughly enjoy Bricolage (maybe it's the good company, maybe it's the vibe). It's definitely worth checking out at least once. And the prices are reasonable enough for the area. Give it a try, you might be surprised by how much you enjoy it.\", u'I came here for brunch on a Sunday and was seated in the garden patio at the back of the restaurant.  We ordered the shrimp & pork summer rolls, vegetarian mushroom banh xeo crepe, and the hot Vietnamese coffee.  The summer rolls were okay, not very memorable.  The crepe was the best dish.  The crepe itself was thin and crispy.  The mushrooms were juicy and there was a lot of it.  I really enjoyed putting it in lettuce wraps and pouring the spicy fish sauce in it.  The coffee was strong and totally hit the spot.  The service was attentive and great.  I would come back here to try their lunch or dinner.', u'Good, well prepared interesting food.  Service was prompt and professional.   We ate outside in the back yard which was nice.   Only four stars due to the outrageously high wine list.  No Chardonnay by the glass?   Lowest price of a glass of Cabernet is 15 bucks.   My wife drank  water and I had a nice draft beer.', u'Outstanding service and the food is equally great. We had the Nom Nom Beef Chips, Cup-O-Pho, Fresh Vegetarian Summer Rolls, Cha Ca La Vong, Lemongrass Grilled Pork Chop, Daly Pie and a tapioca dessert. \\n\\nAs I said, the food was fantastic. Real standouts were: Cup-O-Pho, Cha Ca La Vong and Lemongrass Grilled Pork Chop. The Daly Pie, which is not made in house, was incredibly good. The only thing I would not order again are the Nom Nom Beef Chips. \\n\\nI also have to commend the servers at Bricolage. They are happy, friendly and capable. Keep it up!', u'I\\'m so happy to find a Vietnamese restaurant that doesn\\'t just serve pho and banh mi - clearly there is so much more variety to offer! It was a little scary but also pretty thrilling ordering these dishes I\\'d never come across before, and overall I\\'d say go for it. Everything we had was pretty great. I have a thing for papaya salad, and theirs is really packed with flavor just how I like it. The crepe \"banh xeo\" was fascinating, a huge omelette-looking thing with a super crisp exterior hiding loads of fresh bean sprouts and fillings. We were instructed to tear off some of this crepe, wrap it in a lettuce leaf, and dip into the sauce. Fun and messy, a little bland for my taste, but really glad I tried this. \\n\\nI highly recommend the caramelized shrimp claypot - there\\'s so much goodness from the claypot technique that infuses the shrimp with flavor and the sauce on the bottom of the pot is gold. Eat with plenty of sticky rice. The Unshaking beef was also delicious if you\\'re a beef-lover, it\\'s essentially an extremely well-seasoned perfectly cook sliced steak with a heap of dressed refreshing watercress salad. \\n\\nI\\'ll definitely have to come back to try some other dishes, there\\'s so many to choose from! A great date spot and also a great group dinner spot since the portions are easily shared. Service is really friendly, which is always appreciated.', u\"Not gonna lie, I've been apprehensive about coming here because it seems pretty expensive for Vietnamese food.  However from watching a ton of culinary competition shows, if you can do something very simple well, you'd still get props for it.  That being said, we came here for brunch and ordered the summer rolls and mushroom ban xeo crepe.  The service was a little weird as they took our share plates away so when the summer rolls arrived, we asked for them back.  The summer rolls were unfortunately just OK, one of the shrimps broke the skin as it was too tightly wrapped and it didn't have any scallions or cilantro in it.  Instead of typical minced pork, it was sliced cold pork belly.\\n\\nThe ban xeo was the best part of the meal.  The nicely fried egg was really rich and cut the bean sprouts really nice; really enjoyable to eat wrapping in the bib lettuce and soy/ fish sauce.  The crispy crepe, awesome.  What I particularly also enjoyed was the use of oyster mushrooms as they really remind me of (warm) pork belly - the fatty part, only it's not fatty.  So add that in an egg dish, you've got yourself a nice brunch plate.\", u'No.\\n\\nI really wanted to like this place. The menu reads like a modern take on some Vietnamese classics (some of which I was surprised to see on a restaurant menu even, like the caramelized shrimp - a dish my mom used to make.) I ordered the caramelized claypot shrimp and cha ca la vong.\\n\\nFirst: It was shocking how sad the portions were considering what I had paid. $26 for five shrimps and white rice? $24 for two small pieces of fish on rice noodles?\\n\\nSecond: The broth that the shrimps were cooked in was extremely salty. Beyond the salt, the shrimp also lacked the deep flavor that I expected from the dish. The cha ca was watery at the bottom and the pineapple vs. fish sauce balance was wrong. It tasted like they were too afraid to put in the adequate amount of fish sauce needed for the dish and ended up with a lot of pineapple flavor.\\n\\nOverall, the food frustrated me and the price/portion angered me. I would not recommend this to anyone', u\"Really awesome stuff, first off. I came with my gluten-free sister and fish-allergic girl friend and we all still managed to find amazing dishes to share. \\n\\nThe mushroom crepe appetizer was gigantic - could easily have been almost a whole meal for two and was by far the real star of the night. I'd come back just for that, and I'm not even a huge mushroom fan. \\n\\nAside from that, the spring rolls and entrees (lemon tofu, rice noodles, and papaya salad) were all really great as well. Our server was extremely attentive and I heard the cocktails were really good as well - interesting spins on classics with some really novel ingredients added in that fit the vibe and flavor profile of the restaurant.\\n\\nOverall the space is small and the open kitchen is a nice chance to see the chefs work so well in a tight space. I'm definitely planning to go back to get the crepe again and check out more of the menu!\", u'Fifth visit and I think I am done.  \\n\\nTonight I tried the beef on beef.  It was visually stunning.  The beef looked liked a design on the plate! I had to ask \\'where\\'s the beef\\'?!!  Everything about how this dish looked was amazing.  However looks only take you so far.  It lacked flavor.  I asked for spicy sauce to try and jazz it up.  Not good. I was very disappointed.  \\n\\nThe Malbec however was good.  Where was the spoon surprise?\\n\\nSo I have made my way through the appetizers and the food here lacks a flavor punch one would expect from Vietnamese food.   \\n\\n\\n\\n------\\n\\n\\n\\n2nd visit....\\nDidn\\'t take me long to come back!\\nHad to try more of the food and a cocktail.  Making my way through the appetizers.  The bartender is very friendly and said he loved the crepe so I had to go with that.  Everyone on Yelp seems to love the drinks so going with something new.\\n\\nFirst up is the \"spoon surprise\"!  This time it\\'s Anchiovy on a cracker.  Love the idea of the spoon surprise!  It\\'s good but lived the icy spoon surprise on the previous visit.\\n\\n\\n\\nVietnamese crepe , banh xeo - this dish is big!!! Easily share between 2 people.  It is meant to be wrapped in lettuce but the dish should come with more lettuce given the size of the dish.\\nIt\\'s tasty.  I took half home and bought more lettuce to wrap it in.\\n\\nMatcha tea cocktail- looks beautiful but I did trebly like it.'], u'118.Tofu Tofu': [u\"Solid Korean restaurant in Chinatown!\\n\\nCame here with a friend for early dinner on Friday. We were seated promptly and weren't being rushed or watched like hawks to order. We sat, settled down, chatted for a bit and looked through the menu. Decided to go with the Hae Mool Jeon Gol (J1- $39.95), which is from the casserole section on the menu.\\n\\nPlaced on a portable gas burner on your table, the casserole comes with assorted seafood that includes shrimps, udon noodles, clams, vegetables, tofu, mushrooms, bean sprouts, peppers, etc. Just be careful since the soup can splash a bit while it boils. You know how some casseroles are too large and/or overwhelming for two people to share? Well, this was perfect for two people. They also give you a bowl of rice. Mix some of that soup in there and voila! It wasn't too spicy, in my opinion. But I guess that really depends on your tolerance level.\\n\\nAs for the side dishes or banchans, they gave us the steamed eggs (my favorite), broccoli, macaroni salad, kimchi, kimchi radishes, fish cakes and the Korean style salty cucumber pickles (oijangajji). You know a Korean place is legit if they serve you bomb steamed eggs. It'd be nice if they also gave you like a bowl of soup like denjang jjigae (fermented soybean paste stew) but, I might be asking for too much lololls. Anyways, loved the side dishes.\\n\\nI think I saw mainly two middle aged servers working with one other guy cleaning up the tables and collecting dishes. It got packed around 6pm/7pm. Despite how busy it was, the lady server we had was friendly and attentive. The water cups were always refilled and they gladly packed the leftovers for us to take home, upon request of course. I mean, it wasn't a lot that was left over. We just didn't want to waste any food heh heh. \\n\\nOverall, great service and menu options, friendly staff, clean restroom (smells amazing in there), spacious layout, reasonable price for NYC and cute decor. I especially liked the hanging lightbulbs all over the ceiling. The seatings seemed to consist of mainly 2-4 people per table but I'm sure they can accommodate to bigger groups by combining tables. Oh and mention Yelp and get 10% off your check! I'm so glad I found a solid Korean restaurant in Chinatown. Definitely coming back.\", u'Had the staff provided a very different response, this review would have not been written, and a customer probably would not have been lost. Unfortunately, the experience I had at this Chinatown joint just begs to be shared with the general public. Two nights ago, when I visited Tofu tofu for the second time, I discovered a baby cockroach casually floating in my banchan and alerted the staff of the vile intruder\\'s presence. Predictably, their first response was to dump out the cockroach and replace the banchan from the same open and uncovered containers the contaminated food came from. I voiced my concerns that the entire batch of pickled vegetables had been soaking in cockroach juice and they should probably throw out the batch. Now one would think that it would be a logical assumption to double and triple check the source of the food and make sure that there are no more critters taking a bath in the pool of pickles but nooooo.... instead, the excuses of a really stretched imagination given to save a batch of pickles were somewhat entertaining. \\n\\nExcuse no.1-  \"The little guy must have fell in after the pickles were put into the bowl. He is still dry!\"\\nResponse- \"Picks up the little guy... looks pretty wet to me\"\\n\\nExcuse no.2- \"The chemicals must have killed him and he fell into the bowl before the food was served!\"\\nResponse- \"I don\\'t see any blind servers who can casually pick up a bowl with a diameter of 2.5 inches, ignore the cockroach in it, and proceed to put pickles into the bowl.\"\\n\\nExcuse no.3- \"We are very clean!\"\\nResponse-\"Little guy swimming here doesn\\'t agree\"\\n\\nThe gf and I then left with our hairs standing on our arms but upon hindsight, perhaps we should have given a chance to the server to cast a strong and confident vote in the food safety of the joint by eating the same food he refused to throw out.', u\"Service is really great . Love it the food was great.  I liked that they had the lunch combos and I felt like it was really worth it \\n\\n\\nOn to the bad \\n\\nMy bill in total was $20.00 ( lunch combo).  I got the bill in this little box and so I proceeded to put my card in. When my card came back they charged me $87.00 ... and it was the bill for the other table . I'm not mad about it but it's kinda hard to mess that up when my card was in the little box.kinda hard to mess it up if you're that organized . But either way she was very sorry and didn't give me a hard time  and also she returned the money in cash. \\nso that's why it's still five stars. Would go back again because the food was great and the customer service was great too!\", u\"I love that now we have a great Korean restaurant in Chinatown to satisfy all my Korean cravings and not have to go all the way to Koreatown.  \\n\\nI had the mixed soon tofu and added vermicelli noodles to it.  They made a mistake and gave me ramen at first but once I told them, they have made a mistake they gladly took it back and replaced the noodles.  So I greatly appreciate that kind of service and the waitress came by to check if everything was okay as well.  When you add additional noodles they give you the large stone bowls like the one they use for bibimbap.  So it was huge, I couldn't finish it.  However, it was delicious, the tofu was soft and they don't skimp on their stuff. \\n\\nThe only thing missing was some soju to complete my meal.  However, they are working on getting a liquor license.  I will definitely be back here often and would recommend it.\", u\"Lovely little place we stumbled on after my boyfriend got his haircut near by in China town! \\n\\nWe were surprised to find this little tofu place in the out of no where!! But we are so happy we came! \\n\\nThe restaurant is much larger on the inside once you walk in. It's very cute with a garden theme. Lots of interesting things to look at. \\n\\nThe menu is very similar to BCD tofu with your tofu soups, BBQ, bibimbap, and combos. I love how it's used as your table mat since I like to read the menu while waiting sometimes. \\n\\nWe ended up ordering a bugolgi + tofu soup combo\\nand regular size tofu soup. Then on came the yummy banchans! \\n\\nAll of the food and banchan were yummy and it was really nice that it came with a steamed egg! We also received a side of regular tofu as well too. \\n\\nWhat I did notice was that all of the items here were not as salty and heavy compared so many of the other Korean Restaurants I've been to (which is a good thing!!) that makes me feel like I could definitely come here more often!\\n\\nThe service was also wonderful. They are attentive, kind, and you can tell they are passionate about their restaurant.\\n\\nOverall we concluded that we would definitely come back to Tofu tofu when we are craving Korean food home style and just want to unwind. Yummy and not too heavy! Also cheaper than ktown!\", u\"Welcome Tofu Tofu to Chinatown!\\n\\nI've passed by this establishment a couple of times since it first opened. Honestly, I was a bit skeptical to try this place out because I was unsure of the food's authenticity. However, after hearing good things about it, I finally decided to try this place out with my sister. \\n\\nWe arrived around lunch time and got seated quickly. Once we settled down, we looked through the menu and I was delighted to find a Lunch special section for all types of Soon Tofu. This was perfect for me since spicy tofu soup is usually my go-to dish at a Korean restaurant. I ended up ordering the Mixed Soon Tofu ($11.95), which comes with beef and assorted seafood, and I got it in mild spicy. My sister settled for a Combo Special which comes with a choice of tofu soup, either seafood or veggie. She chose C5 - the Jeyuk Kimchi Combo ($18.95) which is stir fried pork and kimchi, with a side of spicy seafood tofu soup. \\n\\nAs we were waiting for our food, we got served a variety of banchan such as fish cakes, radish, bean sprouts and kimchi, to name a few. The banchan was pretty decent, but the fish cakes were our favorite. The staff came over and noticed we had finished it so he got us more, which was nice. \\n\\nOur food also came very quickly. I was also pleasantly surprised to that the staff brought us free steamed egg, which was a nice addition to our meal. On top of that, we were told that we could get a free beverage - either soda or bottle of water. There were many surprises during our visit but I think this was all part of their grand opening promotion. \\n\\nOverall, everything was delicious. My tofu soup had an abundance of seafood and tofu so I was extremely satisfied. Also, the mild spicy level wasn't spicy at all to me so I think next time, I would try medium just to get more of a kick. My sister enjoyed her food as well but the only thing we felt was lacking was the stir fried pork and kimchi dish. We wished it came with more pork. Otherwise, the flavors were all there and we had a very pleasant experience. I can't wait to come back.\\n\\nTIP: It seems like there's also 10% off if you mention Yelp. I haven't tried this myself since I found out about this after but I'll see if this is still valid when I revisit very soon.\", u\"Tofu Tofu is just great!\\n\\n40+ reviews and over 100 photos after only being open for 2 months??? That says something about this place!\\n\\nYelp led me to Tofu Tofu and it's one of the only Korean options in Chinatown. \\n\\nThey give banchans (appetizers) AND steamed egg to start before your food is served!\\n\\nThe space is clean and spacious. The service is great. The food is tasty. This place is all positives!\\n\\nThank you for coming to the neighborhood, Tofu Tofu!\", u\"I went in as someone who had never had Korean food before and was met with excellent service and suggestions!\\nI got the Veggie Soon Tofu soup which came with rice and appetizers (the kimchi was my favorite). \\nThe food was amazing and I wouldn't change anything about the experience. I look forward to going back and trying more soon.\", u'I don\\'t really like to eat alone, but I needed to beat my hangover, so I went to Chinatown looking for something soupy and hot.  I\\'ve been looking for korean food in chinatown/les for a few months, but hadn\\'t found any yet (go figure, it\\'s \"China\" town), so when I saw the sign outside I was so excited!  I went in and was kindly seated at a table for one-- just thought I ought to mention that the service was really nice and friendly for all you lone eaters out there lol\\n\\nI got the T1. seafood soon tofu for $11.95 (lunch price).  As expected from a korean establishment, they give you seven delicious banchan/side dishes.  The stew was piping hot when served and really hit the spot in terms of flavor and tofu quality.  This place will definitely be one of my regular haunts!', u\"Ate here twice in 3.5 days... it is quickly becoming a go-to for dinner! The service here is a little new/slow but everyone is friendly which makes up for it. The restaurant is also spacious so it would be good for bigger groups. \\n\\nThere are a ton of options on the menu, with pretty much every standard Korean entree/comfort food you could think of. Both times I've had the tofu soup - once mushroom and once mixed (beef/seafood). You also get so many different banchan side dishes - fiance and I were even offered refills on these but the tofu soup was very generously portioned so we were stuffed. To our surprise, we also got a complimentary steamed egg, which was so delicious. The tofu soup is prepared very well and they nailed the spice level - I got mild and fiance got medium and we were both really happy with how they came out. \\n\\nPrices are very reasonable and standard for the quantity/quality of food. All the food from our neighbors smelled amazing so we will definitely be back to try some of the other menu items. A great new addition to the LES/Chinatown area!\", u'New Korean restaurant in town. Nice environment, and good place to dine in with friends and family. You get lots of free start up appetizers like other typical Korean restaurants. But is a bit pricey compared to other restaurants in the neighborhood. I ordered two sets of lunch special.', u'Rare Korean restaurant in Chinatown. Their specialty is soondobu but there are a couple of other things on the menu as well. I went in their first week of opening. They have great lunch specials during weekdays that are cheaper than BCD or any place in K-town and with none of the wait. The staff are super attentive and are generous with refilling their banchan. I would definitely come here again if I was craving soondobu.', u'Restaurant is new and clean. Must try their seafood scallion pancake. Seafood in every bite. Good price for the money.', u'Found this hidden gem in chinatown and had to post a review. \\n\\nAll the side dishes were fresh and well seasoned. You also get a free steamed egg which was perfect for a rainy day. Mini bo ssam (pork belly) was so so so good. But the main star was definitely the steaming hot tofu soup! \\n\\nDefinitely worth checking out if you want good authentic Korean food in Chinatown!', u'Place is pretty new so we decided to come here for something to eat and it is actually pretty good, reasonable price, good portion and when we ordered beef soon tofu with ramen and kimchi and pork fried rice and we go free steamed egg. Also staff constantly refills side dishes whenever we run out. Oh also the fried rice is in a heart!', u\"Nice little new korean bbq spot that opened outside of K-town. It's right in the middle of chinatown and the prices are not bad considering the amount of food you get here. They're newer so things arent super dirty yet. The bbq was good, but you really come here for the tofu which was good as well. Good compared to BCD tofu\", u\"I'm from Los Angeles and the Korean food is amazing there considering the koreatown is HUGE.\\nThis place is 30 min by train from my house, and it ain't bad at all. I got the tofu la kalbi combo which was good, my favorite part of this meal was the poached egg, I've never seen that done at tofu houses usually they just give you an egg to crack into the soup. I prefer the poached egg. Overall satisfied with my meal, and will be back for tofu fix here.\\n\\nIt's like 2-3$ more than la but given it's NYC and a much more expensive city to operate. So the price is pretty on par with what I expected to pay!\", u\"Walked in with doubt because it's in Chinatown... saw that the staffs are Korean my hopes got higher. The place is nice and clean, the staffs are nice! The food was great! Don't have to go up to Ktown for Korean food if I'm around this area! Would def come back for lunch and dinner! Highly recommend people to come try their foods!\", u\"I'm so glad a Korean restaurant opened close by to my apartment. The soft tofu soup is legit. My favorite is the clam one. My sister and I got a la galbi to share and jap Chae. The kimchi was really good too. You get some side dishes as a free accompaniment(ban chan).\", u\"The food was okay. I love how there's always a lot of free side dish. I got this seafood with beef tofu soup with the rice free. It was very hot but also very tasty. There was a lot of meat inside. If you like Korean and tofu it will be a great place for you to eat here!!!!\"], u'43.RK Talkies Indian Cuisine': [u'I went to this place with couple of my friends. There were a lot of vegetarian options. I ordered vegetable rice bowl that came with nan and lassi. It was an absolutely delicious meal. The wait staff, owner and chef were really friendly. Overall, a great experience. I will definitely come back for more. \\n\\nI highly recommend it.', u\"Was in town visiting family and looking for an easy takeout option for dinner. This is a brand new restaurant, so we decided to try it out. The menu has many of the standard, familiar Indian dishes. We ordered chicken tikka masala, chicken korma, and lamb vindaloo off the dinner prix fixe menu, and an order of aloo gobi. I called ahead and my order was ready in almost no time. Super speedy.\\n\\nThe portions were incredibly generous and everything had great flavor! The garlic naan and samosas were fantastic, and we had leftovers for the next day. Incredible at this price point. They even threw in a free rice pudding for dessert! \\n\\nThe owner and chefs were so generous. They came out to greet me when I picked up my order, and they were friendly and eager to please new customers. It put a huge smile on my face. A suggestion to them: offer a higher heat option for people who want a little more spice. The flavors were spot-on, but would love more kick on the vindaloo. \\n\\nThough I didn't eat in, this restaurant has got a lot of seating for a small space, and it's BYOB. Combined with a friendly staff that really wants to serve the neighborhood, it's definitely worth a visit to support and help them grow and improve. I totally recommend this place and will be back the next time I'm out in Williamsburg.\", u\"I've had the bowl and the pork bhuni. My friend said  the pork bhuni was exclusive to a specific region in India, hence why it's not found in many Indian restaurants. Service was amazing, prompt and done with a smile. \\n\\nAtmosphere- very well wit, cozy restaurant. Will be back soon!\", u\"I'm from Maryland last week I come visit my friends .i check there menus in yelp that was totally different first time I'm see in Indian restaurant.Naan which and crab ball curry I tried that's was awesome .your food call me back again New York.thank you\", u\"I was so impressed by RK Talkies. Having studied Indian cooking with Julie Sahni and travelled in India, I am a harsh critic of most Indian restaurants in NYC. Generally I find the food bland and generic.  Although I've only eaten here once, the food at RK Talkies was neither. Everything was perfectly spiced to the exact heat level we requested. And what I really loved was, in addition to the standard samosas and curries, were many dishes I rarely see on a menu. One of them is Koliwada fish, which I've had and made more in a pakora style. This version was deep fried but not at all greasy and the delicate taste of the aijwan seeds came through. We also tried the samosa chaat, which was a delicious version with loads of chickpeas and fried farina on top. For mains we had the Chicken Xiacuti, which was fabulous, and the crab ball curry, which was very good. I loved the sauce but the balls had a little too much breading and a little too little crab. The rice had yummy fried shallots on top and the garlic naan was excellent; just the right amount of char and ghee. And to add to the experience, service was super friendly. When we mentioned having been to India, the chef owner came out to talk to us and see how we liked the food. I feel like I have found a replacement for my beloved Tikka Grill (still mourning its closing); unfortunately, I don't live in Williamsburg. I'll be back at the Knitting Factory in a month and can't wait to come back here first and try some other dishes.\", u\"Take my word for it. This is one of the best indian restaurants I've ever been to. I had their famous Saag Paneer and Chicken Nanwich and it was to die for!!!. Its a new restaurant and i highly recommend it.\", u'So excited to have a new go-to Indian spot in the neighborhood. My husband and I ordered take out from here last week and were first off, blown away by how kind and friendly the owners and chef were. As for the food - definitely hit the spot! I got the Chicken Tikka Masala, which was cooked to perfection and just the right amount of spice. My husband ordered the Lamb Vindaloo, which he enjoyed, and of course we had to get the garlic naan. We got the prix fixe meal, which was a really good deal. Will definitely be ordering again!', u\"I ordered delivery from here last night. I was excited to try it out because of the good reviews, but was unpleasantly surprised by the food. \\n\\nThe portions are big and the delivery was fast, but the food wasn't good at all. I ordered with my two roommates, and everyone agreed that the food was not good. Every dish we had was bland, and every other neighborhood indian place I've tried is better. \\n\\nThe samosas were meh, chana masala was bland, as was the aloo gobi, and the poori was the worst poori I've ever had. \\n\\n* The food did taste healthier than most indian places I've been to. So if RK Talkies is trying to serve healthier Indian food, then I can forgive the poor taste. If it's not, then the food just isn't great.\", u'They\\'re really new - they opened almost 2 weeks ago. Because of this, they\\'re willing to listen to your opinions about the food and things. One guy I talked to said they are trying to bring something authentic to the area - meaning authentic Indian food. I\\'m not sure how \"authentic\" it is, since I think they\\'re also trying to cater to the tastes of Americans, and the food is very mild to me. But I really appreciate that they are willing to change it up according to how people feel. And, these guys are from India.\\nAlthough I\\'m Asian, I\\'m not Indian, so maybe I don\\'t know what I\\'m talking about in regards to really authentic Indian food; but I do hope that they make the food unapologetically Indian!! :)\\n1 restroom, which is very clean. \\n\\nThe first time I ordered from them, they had ran out of one of the desserts, and instead gave me 2 other different desserts. Service is great.', u'The place opened yesterday and we tried the food today. I ordered Kathi roll and my husband ordered Butter Chicken and Garlic Naan. The food is really good and the price is right. We will order again.'], u'38.GB Crown Tavern': [u'Decided to pop in tonight and try out the new Myrtle restaurant. The happy hour margaritas were perfect-- made from scratch with none of that premixed lime BS. Loved it!\\n\\nThey were doing a special opening deal that if you order and entree you get a free appetizer. We took them up on that offer and got the Mac and cheese (SO CHEESY AND GOOD), calamari, pork chop, and chile relleno. Honestly this food tastes so fresh and the flavors are on point. We are definitely going back!', u\"This is a tuff review, I'm really trying to give 5 Stars but I have a couple of issues. \\nPlace was very loud, I know it's a younger atmosphere but there were older folks enjoying meals as well. \\nI had to constantly flag down the other waitress cause I could never get my waiters attention. She was very gracious and helpful. \\nTables are small so don't order your meals all at once (appetizers) Happy hour was till 8 I like that a lot. Mac and cheese was great. Mussels were a small potion but then again only $5, asked for plain bread they didn't have any. Pork Chop was a little under cooked but tasty. Mashed cauliflower was awesome. \\nWill give it smoother try and hopefully move the to 5 Stars.\", u'This is a lovely place. The food was great and the service was excellent. Will come back.', u'Had a great time at this jewel in FG/CH. The happy hour menu is awesome! $5 everything..... basically :-). Had the spice Margarita and calamari. Pretty good.', u\"Stumbled in to this small Gem recently and I must say I can't wait to return our waiter Juan was fantastic hospitality was on point service was fast and efficient . Juan recommended many great items from food to drinks,  all his recommendation were great my spouse & I loved everything don't miss out on There phenomenal happy hour Monday through Friday 4pm to 8pm with some food and drinks  for 5 dollars can't  go wrong very economical . Must try the delicious Mussels , Mac && cheese and especially the quesadilla\", u\"Finally stopped by this place and don't regret it. Went for the happy hour and the options were great. \\n\\nWe ordered the calamari and burger special and it was on point. Their beer selection is pretty good.\\n\\nI will definitely come by soon.\", u'Would definitely go back - great HH, great HH food (so rare) and great service! Ultimate trifecta. Had the empanadas (empaniditas... something like that), mussels, and mac and cheese. All 3 were flavorful and in portions big enough to share. Loved that the front of the restaurant is open air because we could tie the dog up out front. Definitely planning to go back and try some of the non HH food.', u'best food ever had speciality the fish tacos , pulled pork slider, they have good selecci\\xf3n of beers, the margaritas different flavor .. five starts for them!!!!', u'Came to GB Crown Tavern for Happy Hour on Friday evening. The HH menu was great... Mac & cheese was good; mussels were fab; $5 mojitos on point. Staff was friendly and vibe was low-key. Would recommend for HH!', u'Great brunch special. Good food. The sangria is awesome. The French toast is amazing.', u'Good food, good service, decent drinks. \\n\\nHad a good snack here: shrimp ceviche (totally acceptable) garnished with plantain chips (I wanted more) and a happy hour cucumber margarita that was gratefully not too sweet (props to the waiter who got me the happy hour menu just under the wire). Would happily come back.', u\"Great food and great drinks! Four of us stopped by to take advantage of the $5 happy hour margarita deal and grab some food. The margarita and mojito menu has lots of variety, and the drinks were great. Highly recommend the cucumber margarita. \\nFood was awesome. Happy hour food was also $5: Chorizo Mac and cheese, Fish tacos, quesadilla, mussels, all awesome. We split the salmon and skirt steak, very tasty as well. While we didn't exactly eat healthy last night, there are good options when we want to eat out with out breaking the calorie bank. \\nHighly recommend stopping by, we'll be back soon!\", u\"Let me just kick start this review by saying it's been awhile since I've gone to a restaurant and I literally didn't have one thing to take issue with! From the service to the food to the amazing and yes amazing is the word for their coconut margaritas. Coconut is not usually my first choice of flavor when I order a rita, but our waiter/host recommended it and I was happy that I obliged after the first sip. The bar tender definitely knows what he is doing when it comes to those!  I've been here twice with my boyfriend and so far both times have ended in being a lovely evening out for dinner. Our waiter seats us right away and tends to our every request in a timely fashion. So far each one of his entree recommendations have been on point from the glazed passion fruit ribs (special btw) to their roasted chicken. Affordable pricing for the quantity of food they serve, oh and try the fish tacos! You will not regret it! The first time we came we ordered two as an appetizer. The second time we went back we doubled up! Too good, too good! I haven't had fish tacos that delicious in awhile. As far as the ambiance it's very chill. Music is playing (not too loud) and never too crowded. Always just the right amount of people if that makes sense. I guess you could say low key, but I'm sure that won't last long once the whole hood finds out about this little gem in the Fort Greene/Clinton Hill area!\", u'New spot with really awesome drinks! $5 margaritas and mojitos with a bunch of different flavor options like mango, cucumber, jalape\\xf1o... I had the quesadilla and fish tacos which were both tasty. I will be going back to try more of the menu items. The big open windows were really nice to sit by and people watch. The staff is super friendly, I totally recommend this spot.', u'Really enjoyed our experience here. Food was fantastic and not too pretentious, the drinks are even better. Their margaritas come in all kinds of funky flavors and are made with fresh ingredients. Will be back soon!', u'A solid addition to the neighborhood; sort of an anti-Gentleman Farmer (that place is fine, but expensive). GB is a little eclectic: loud classic rock playing on the stereo while the soccer game plays on TV; a series of Central American dishes on the menu, interrupted by a Jamaican-style mussels, a burger and a BLT. Is it schizophrenic? More likely, it\\'s an attempt to cater to different tastes and serve as a \"neighborhood place.\" It might even be that the owner of its prior incarnation, Kultura, realized that menu was too specialized for the area. \\n\\nThat said, I find little fault with either cuisine. The burger is quite tasty, affordable, and well-cooked: you order it medium and you get medium throughout, not charred on the outside and raw in the middle. $13 for a cheeseburger with all the fixings and ample fries is actually very reasonable in Fort Greene. The fish tacos are tasty and light. The ceviche is good, though fairly spicy even for ceviche (I wouldn\\'t recommend it if you don\\'t like spicy foods; if you do though, you\\'re I luck!).\\n\\nThe service was prompt and friendly. The happy hour deals are really impressive (e.g., fish tacos might have been 2 for $5; cocktails also $5). Quirky in some ways but down to earth and recommended.', u'So good!  They have 5$ margaritas and mojitos for happy hour!  They also have some 5$ dishes,  like a bunch of mussels for 5 bucks amazing!  Staff is awesome and answered all my questions.  Great addition to Myrtle Ave.', u'The food was flavorful and moist. The service was great and the drinks delicious! Their happy hour has some great deals too. Would definitely go back.', u'So happy this opened in our hood! Ate their with my family last night just to \"support the new guy\" and was pleasantly surprised. Not your standard Latin food... definitely someone more skilled in the kitchen! I had the Jumbo shrimp and they were seasoned and cooked perfectly. The quesadilla was flavorful and not greasy at all. The margaritas were fresh and delicious and the place is relatively kid friendly (at least for an easy dinner time). This will definitely be our go-to for Latin from now on. Welcome to Clinton Hill!', u'This is the best new restaurant on Myrtle. Excellent atmosphere, the drinks are creative and fresh, and the draft selection is tastefully curated. The staff is accommodating, knowledgeable and friendlier than most New York eateries. The food is underpriced for the level of culinary skill and quality. I highly recommend the mussels and fish tacos!'], u'39.The Farm On Adderley': [u\"I cannot write enough good things, but I'll try:\\n\\nScenery - yes, there's something to to be admired here. vines draping down from the wooden fence in the outdoor seating with wooden tables and chairs. inside, has a more at home feel with similar wooden furniture, but nothing can really beat an outdoor garden in NYC.\\n\\nFood - \\nsausage and eggs: beautiful scramble that was fluffy, light, and had just a tint of white to it. the home fries were A M A Z I N G. best home fries i've ever tasted and not the dry over baked/ pan fried ones you would expect. the caramelized onions may be the secret here. sausage patty proved to be a generous portion of meat, but dont expect your typical links here.\\n\\nchicken schnitzel: dont let the word schnitzel scare you off. had to google image this and saw some fried chicken so i knew this was the dish for me. i was 100% correct - fried chicken served on top of salad dressed with light vinagrette. the flavors went so well together and for $14 it was so worth it.\\n\\nchocolate bread: this one was okay. $4 for two pieces of bread that didn't blow my mind. very buttered up, but toasted perfectly. \\n\\nCoffee: From brooklyn roasters, definitely on the sour + acidic side and not my cup. they offer refills!\\n\\nService - so we got seated by one person, had a different waiter, probably was asked by the manager how we were doing and saw a very well dressed man who took away our cup of water with a mosquito in it speedily who we assume to be the boss. \\n\\nComplaints - can fries with mayo really be worth $8?? discouraged me from trying it. wish the gaps in the outside tables wouldn't be so wide because i dropped my fork 2x through them hahahaha. \\n\\nThough there were some things that were average, our two dishes were so unique and flavors went so well together. Can't wait to come back and try their other dishes to see if they're just as phenomenal!\", u\"Sunday, October 1, 2017. My boyfriend and I arrived for brunch just shy of 11:00am. The place was lively but no where near crowded. We are seated shortly after we arrive. \\n\\nOther than having our water glasses filled, we received absolutely no attention from waitstaff . If the restaurant was full to capacity, this would be slightly understandable. However, that was not the case today. We ended up leaving after 15 minutes of being ignored. \\n\\nI'm still in shock about the abysmal and unacceptable service we experienced this morning. I've eaten here several times in the past and have experienced way better service, even when the place has been significantly more packed than it was today. One thing I do know for certain: I will be spending my hard earned money at establishments on Cortelyou where I am positive that the customer service is decent. Because that is definitely not the case at The Farm.\", u'Can I just say this place is just the cutest place ever !!? \\n\\nThe food was honestly just as great at the outside patio. We came around 12ish and thankgod we got there before the brunch rush. Got seated right away and we had the farm omelette and the adult grilled cheese as well as the fries with curry mayo. \\n\\nMy omelette was hands down the best. And not to mention the side salad we had, the dressing on the salad was phenomenal as well. \\n\\nMy boyfriends grilled cheese was okay, not my favorite. \\n\\nThe star of this brunch was definitely the fries with curry mayo. The curry mayo is so addicting !', u\"The farm is fine & for down there in Ditmas it was/is ahead of the dining curve but it's not that magical. Like it's good but it's kinda straight up & not distinguishable from lots of other locally sourced traditional fare American restaurants.\\n\\nNot that every place needs to be doing something different, it's reliable for all meals, I just wish they had like a few must have items. \\n\\n*Note they were doing oysters & stout which isn't my thing but at least it was different. \\n\\nThough they do a solid job in the wine / alcohol department.\", u\"Came in last minute with a group of ten for Sunday brunch. We were all in town for a nearby wedding. They seated all of us comfortably within an hour or so during prime hours. Their food was delicious, staff was happy & friendly. I ordered the Adult Grilled Cheese for $9; the price was right and the sandwich/salad combo was delish! I also tried the French fries with the curry mayo, one word: YUM!  I'm not from the area but would definitely come back if I had the chance. Highly recommended, just be aware of possible long wait times during busy hours of operation.\", u\"Really nice brunch! I had the chocolate bread and Farmer's Breakfast, while my friends had the burger and red flannel hash. So much food - couldn't even finish it! Decent coffee, too.\", u'There were certain charms found here that makes me want to return but the brunch fare wasn\\'t one of them. I ordered the flannel hash since I cannot resist beets. It\\'s exactly what it is, corned beef with beet cubes and the sunny side egg along with market greens. The beet sauce that came with the meal helped with the overall dryness of the beet and hash; without it I don\\'t think I\\'d be able to finish the plate. \\n\\nThe sausage that came in the sausage and eggs platter was... interesting. It was not your average sweet breakfast sausage, it was savory and loaded with sage and bits of ginger. It was also very dry. I wish they had a description of the \"sausage\" because honestly, we would not have ordered it because we don\\'t like ginger and the sage was just way too overpowering to make the sausage tasty. \\n\\nThe waitress was warm, the waiter was comical, and the little animals that came with the bill to make sure it doesn\\'t fly off contributes a whimsical touch to The Farm. Best food item from brunch was the side of fries, which really shouldn\\'t be the selling point here. Perhaps dinner is better.', u\"Awesome brunch. Really excellent. We visited on Memorial Day, because this was one of the only restaurants serving brunch that Monday. Naturally, they were packed to the brim. It was about a 30 minute wait for a table for two, but we happily waited (they only take reservations for parties of 5 or more). \\n\\nIt's a beautiful space, lots of natural light and decor that evokes the feelings of an upscale rustic farm. We shared the French Toast and the Farmer's Breakfast, and both were absolutely scrumptious. The French Toast was perfectly dense and sweet, with fresh strawberries and real maple syrup. The Farmer's Breakfast had a really interesting, savory flavor, brought on by the combination of eggs, potatoes and chard. A hearty, delicious meal, and excellent service. Worth your time.\", u'A+ mazing food. Great portions. Friendly staff. Simple interior / decor. \\n\\nI had a lovely time here with my family. We ate well, and it was super affordable for the quality of food. \\n\\nI had the yummiest eggs, and potato concoction. \\nYummy cookies-- golden raisin and the proceeds get donated to...\\nAte outside and enjoyed the rays on a sunny Saturday in Brooklyn. \\n\\nEveryone at the table thought it was a feast and the coffee is strong, robust and yummy. \\n\\nEat fresh, feel fresh!\\n\\nLove, \\nRenee lives up in B K', u\"This spot is great for a date. But it's also kid friendly. The food was delicious and the drinks were amazing ! Price point is decent but well worth it. There is outdoor dining in the back and also looks sheltered for colder weather. The ambience is slightly dark but not too dark. I was also told they support locals which is nice.\", u\"came here for brunch on labor day. pretty big place with varied seating. they have a front area, middle room, and the backyard. everyone wants to sit in the backyard on a nice day so expect a wait. we settled for sitting in the middle room, which is has a view of the yard and you can still get a partial al fresco experience. relatively simple menu. we ordered the french toast and the farm omelet. omelet has two ingredients (onions & cheddar) and is tasty enough. the french toast is nicely made with powdered sugar but I would have a liked a compote instead of just sliced strawberries.I guess I was distracted and didn't notice that it should have been a compote? good and pleasant service. food came out quickly. overall, cool place.\", u'We liked our meals but be prepared to wait with nothing to do. We hoped showing up after 2pm would avoid the lines but instead we almost missed the waitlist. If this was in my neighborhood it would be worth it, but making a special trip for it was not.\\n\\nThis place was full of friends and families. We ended up at the bar since we had limited options. I was starving by the time I ate so it feels like a blur.', u\"I was a little underwhelmed.  Our waitress was great  and the decor was cool. I like the vibe. However, the French dip was a little over cooked and bland. I did not particularly like the salad on the sandwich, not a big deal though. The fries could have been crispier but they were still good. What I didn't like was the homemade ketchup. It was a little grainy and I didn't care for the taste. The curry sauce was good but wasn't in the mood for it at lunch.\", u\"The food was amazing. I had the chicken schnitzel, it was a good portion, the greens were delicious as well. We also had the fries, chocolate and sea salt bread and were enamored with them all. As far as drinks I had coffee along with apple cider mimosas which was crisp, tart  and bubbly. We had the chocolate mouse with salt cream and apple crisp with vanilla gelato for dessert. The apple crisp was okay the mousse was scrumptious! \\n\\n\\nI took a star off because we were a group of 9 and we showed up in 4, 3 and 2 people groups and they wouldn't seat us until 7 people came. We waited 20 mins for our other members to arrive and it was JAM PACKED. We had this reservation for about a week and all agreed to have some apps while we waited but were still not seated even though our table was ready.\", u\"Cute brunch spot in the neighborhood. Casual/friendly vibe with a lot of families and younger couples. The menu wasn't particularly extensive or unique, but the prices were decent, especially vs. Manhattan and the food tasted exactly as you'd expect. Very standard brunch fare. Service was very nice and accommodating. Delicious homemade ketchup.\\n\\nOne note, fresh orange juice didn't taste very fresh.\", u\"Been to The Farm many times for dinner and brunch/lunch. Not much to complain about! Staff is always nice and food is delicious. \\n\\nBrooklyn Roasters coffee = yum. French fries with curry mayo = ugh so good. Farm burger with egg = drool. \\n\\nCute little spot in Ditmas Park if you want a great meal. They always have special holiday menus too if you're into a romantic dinner (i.e. Valentine's Day). Make a reservation! ;)\", u\"I came here with a party of four on Mother's Day. I have been here once before about a year prior with my grandmother. I don't even remember the first visit. I just remember having awful service. My Mom was so eager to try this restaurant. Food was not farm to table, service was rude.\\n\\nIt seemed as if all of the entrees were pre cooked for Mother's Day, and not understaffed because they had a lot of people working. We were not the only table that seemed upset. My entree was cold - and when I told the waiter, he challenged me. As opposed to making the customer happy.\\n\\nFries are extremely salty. Steaks were over cooked. If you have one pasta dish on the menu, please have the pasta be extraordinary. It was if it came from Trader Joe's (I love Trader Joe's but when you are doing out, you want expect more).\\n\\nThe waiter did offer a dish complimentary and I denied because I was so disappointed. I had added on an appetizer - and was charged for this. I ordered something not to make my Mom so sad and concerned.\", u\"I came here on a Friday morning and it was very quiet and slow, I guess because there wasn't a brunch that day. The place is really cozy, trendy, and treated with love, even the bathroom was lovely and well appointed. Service was great, our waitress was very attentive and sweet. Everything on the menu looked delicious. I got an omelette with cheddar and caramelized onions, with side potatoes and fresh greens. The omelette was perfectly fluffy and soft, just how I like it. The potatoes weren't crispy but they tasted great. The salad was very fresh. The coffee was also on point and our waitress came by to refill often. We sat there chatting for a long time after we paid the bill and nobody bothered us or rushed us to leave. I'd definitely come back here again. Parking was okay, and there are some quiet residential streets right off Cortelyou where you can find spots fairly quickly.\", u\"Wanted to go somewhere local for brunch, so I took my sisters to this farm to table brunch in Brooklyn. Funny how I've never been to this area before but it looks promising.\\n\\nCame in and was seated immediately, think we avoided the brunch crowd just by half an hour. Our table ordered the Red Flannel Hash, Scrambled Eggs & Sausage, Chicken Schnitzel, Grapefruit juice, Apple cider, and a side of hand cut fries.\\n\\nThe Chicken Schnitzel was a bit dry, Scrambled Eggs and Sausage was decent, I really enjoyed the Red Flannel Hash. A healthier twist on the regular corned beef hash with the addition of beets, this was a pretty good dish. The side salad was also enjoyable and I normally don't do salads. The apple cider is very good and my sisters enjoyed the grapefruit juice. \\n\\nThe service was excellent and the decor as well. I would come back to check out their dinner menu.\", u\"Great restaurant! \\nWe went there for brunch before a 3pm show in the King Theater. \\nThere was a line to be seated but it moved pretty quickly. The place is a little tight but cozy. It looks like they also have a great outside area for Summer. We got two most delicious Bloody Mary's. They make their Mix daily in the house with lots of horseradish. So so good! They also support local farms and carry only humanly raised and killed meat. \\nWe got the Red Flannel hash, the sausage and egg and a side of grits. Both dishes came with side salad with a very tasty dressing. My potatoes were delicious! My sausage and egg were huge! The grits were perfectly seasoned and delicious. \\n\\nWe shall absolutely come back and bring friends.\"], u'200.Totonno\\u2019s': [u\"I know it can be a long subway ride to get here for lots of New Yorkers but if you like pizza do yourself a favor and come out to Totonos. This is one of the best pizzas in the country and I didn't even have to wait hours to get it. \\n\\nLets start with the history. The first pizza place in the US was opened by Gennaro Lombardi in Manhattan. This restaurant laid the foundation for the best pizza places in the country: Frank Pepes, John on Bleeker etc. Another one of the Lombardi disciples is Totonos. So you are not just going to any really good pizza place you are going to one with a great history. \\n\\nI went on a Sunday at about 4:30. I walked in and there was only one other group there. The places is pretty small (maybe 10 tables) but there was no wait. This stood out to me as I have waited hours in line for other places that are as famous (Gramaldis, DiFara, Beddia). There is only one guy making pizzas with ensures quality control but also means it might take a little bit to get your food. \\n\\nWhich brings me to the most important part. The actual pizza. The crust was amazing. It was nice and crisp but not too hard that it hurts. It is strong enough to hold the ingredients and not just fall down but at the same time chewy. Then there is the cheese they are using premium mozzarella here now shredded but carefully pulled part by the pizzaiolo and neatly placed. I got pepperoni on my pizza and it was delicious and the right amount where it didnt over take the other flavors. Finally, the sauce was also amazing as it is gently poured over top of the cheese and has occasional chunks of actual tomatoes. \\n\\nThis is one of the top 5-10 pizza places in the country. Anytime I am near Coney Island I will make sure to pass by and again.\", u\"I have come here many times and I have to say although the pizza is amazing. The price is just not justifiable for any pizza. There any many pizza shops in NY popping up all over and you can get a pie for half the price for the same quality. \\n\\nI do think that if you are visiting NY, particularly Coney Island, you have to try Totonnos. It's a classic and old fashioned NY pizza that I think is a must on any To Do list. They've done things the same way since day one and it's been perfect. If only the pies were a little bit cheaper I would come here everyday.\", u\"Pizza was ok, tasted better pizza and expected a better tasting pizza at this place.\\n\\nThe waitresses were extremely rude and would've appreciated good service.\\n\\nThis opinion was shared with the group we were with and as a customer that is paying, no one should put up with rudeness, go elsewhere....\", u\"My friend saw a video on Vice about Totonno's so that's pretty much all I have to say about why we came...\\n\\nWe arrived around 4:45 PM on a Saturday and there were 4-5 small parties ahead of us. We just got in the back of the line. There's no point in going into the restaurant to tell them that you're waiting. They know and will just direct you outside to the end of the line. We probably waited about 40 minutes before we were seated. The restaurant is fairly small. There's about 10 table, each seating between 4-6 people. \\n\\nTake the time in the line to think about what you want to order. Once you're seated, they'll quickly come over and ask you what you want. The menu is up top in the back of the restaurant. It's pretty straightforward - small or large and what toppings you want.\\n\\nMy friend and I ordered a large without any additional toppings. They don't allow outside drinks and don't serve tap water (unless you want to get some from the bathroom sink), so your only option for a drink is to order one. \\n\\nOur pie took about 15 minutes to make. The large comes in eight decently-sized slices. The bottom was thin and crispy, with the crust being both pillowy and chewy. The sauce was tasty, but the best part was the fresh mozzarella cheese. With each bite, I got a nice pull of cheese. \\n\\nThe level of service is quite low. They expect you to know what you want when you order, and they don't seem like they like explaining what your options are. Also, there seems to be no sense of urgency or remorse, though there's a lot of people waiting outside or if they got your order wrong.\\n\\nOverall, we're glad we gave Totonno's a try. The pizza was good, but I don't think the wait, service, and vibe are beckoning me to return. \\n\\nSome things to note:\\n-To-go orders: Skip the line and walk right in. The wait will still be around the same amount of time as standing in line.\\n-Sharing tables: From what I've noticed, they don't put smaller parties together. For example, they had my friend and me sitting at a 6-top and parties of two still waiting in line. However, they don't mind strangers sitting together. So be brave and ask if you can share a table with a stranger!\", u\"Be prepared to wait outside in a line for a while to get a table in this tiny pizza enclave. \\n\\nThen be prepared to wait longer for your pie to be made from scratch once you score a seat. \\n\\nOh, but it's worth the wait for that delicious pizza. Oh, that crust. \\n\\nAn old school NYC joint doing pizza right. Just a tiny menu to choose from above the kitchen where the magic happens in that coal oven. Just a handful of toppings to put on your delicious and fresh thin crust pie. Family owned since 1924. Cash only here so be prepared.\\n\\nWe had a large regular pie with chopped garlic on it and it was wonderful. Along with a few Coke's made a nice meal. Service is a bit gruff, and the tiny place itself with only a few tables can be a bit rough to some, but to us that is what gives it that old NYC charm. Simple and no frills. I like that. An original that you don't find much anymore.\\n\\nA must visit when out in Coney Island.\\n\\nAfter all, pizza is life.\", u\"My all time favorite NYC pizza, hands down. No contest. Everyone else go home.\\n\\nBring a friend and your appitite because this is a full pie joint. The service is NY brusque and hand-made slow, but SO worth the wait. \\n\\nThe garlic pie was everything I ever wanted and more. I was burping garlic for hours. I like to think of it as little reminders of deliciousness. It's even stellar plain. Beautifully coal oven charred, fairly thin crust. Tasty sauce bubbling up through the strategically placed rounds of mozzarella.... Perfect. \\n\\nThe seating is a bit limited because the tables are mostly for parties of 4 or more, so don't be surprised if you find a queue outside. The wait time isn't all that bad because people don't tend to linger. \\n\\nThey have the average selection of bottled soda and water, with a small wine list and a limited selection of beer. Honestly, I would skip the beer for a trip to Coney Island Brewery only a short walk away, because you're not here for beer. You're here for some of the best pizza that only New York can offer. \\nSuck it Chicago!\", u'So there is some sketch stuff going on at this joint. I\\'m fairly confident there is some \"connection\" if you catch my drift. A group on 6 of us went here on a Saturday afternoon. We were seated immediately however a table of two was placed at a table for 6 and the owner/waitress was basically like yeah you gotta move LOL. That was something to see.\\n\\n#1 The spot is cash only. BRING CASH!\\n#2 The pizza is awesome. We tried the pepperoni and sausage (the pepperoni being waaaay better than the sausage)\\n#3 Water is not free - you buy all of your own drinks\\n#4 Staff - oy! Hahaha they are something and you almost have to go to see it.\\n#5 Space - it\\'s about as plain as plain can get. You get paper/plastic utensils which I quite enjoy for pizza.\\n\\nThis is like a huge spot to go if you are a pizza fan. It\\'s super delicious but not life changing so unless you\\'re in the area I wouldn\\'t go all the way out to Coney Island to get it but I would definitely never turn down a slice.', u\"Gosh... the pizza at Totonno's is amazing. It's undeniable. \\n\\nThe catch is, you got to wait to get into the restaurant, and wait even longer for your pizza to be prepared. Service is slightly lacking, and the oven can only bake one or two pizzas at a time.\", u\"Skip Nathan's and come here. You can get Nathan's from Costco and it's literally the same thing. \\n\\nTotonno's an old-school pizza place. Coal oven, Well done pizza. Black crust. Things that might turn some people off but totally turn me on (wait, what?). Limited seating but worth the wait if there's a line going out the door. They offer two pies (small & large). We had chopped garlic and olives on our large pie. The garlic is no joke but at least you'll be safe from vampires. The pizza takes a while to come out but keep in mind it's made the old way and the wait only makes you want to eat more of it.\\n\\nService is kinda eh but you're not coming here for that. Cokes are served in glass bottles. You get one napkin each (unless you ask for more). The prices are fair considering how large the pizzas are. It was absolutely delicious and honestly if Coney Island wasn't so far away I would be here every other week just for some pizza.\", u\"One of the best pies in Brooklyn. If it wasn't for Difara and l&b, this would be my go to place for a pie in Brooklyn.\", u\"Five ravenous folks after the Mermaid Parade trekked to this pizza joint and OOH-WEE were their tummy satisfied and happy =].\\n\\nAmongst the five of us, we ordered a large margherita ($20.00) and a small mushroom ($20.50) and demolished ALL of it!* They also serve beer for about $6.00 a pop. \\n\\nThe pies came out hot, hot, HOT (literally - steam for days - and figuratively - damn, those are good looking pies -). The dough, crust, sauce and cheese on both pies were ON POINT! \\n\\nFirst, the dough and crust were crispy rather than chewy, so not quite Neapolitan style, but scrumptious nonetheless! Second, the sauce was perfectly tangy and sweet. Lastly, the cheese had that pull, stretch and bounce - tasted really fresh!\\n\\nThe margherita didn't come with basil, but that's okay because I usually pick that off. However, it made the pie look a tat bit naked. As for the mushroom pie, they were pretty light handed with the mushroom.   \\n\\nTakeaway - DO IT!! It's  worth the wait =]\\n\\n*Not really sure how the small was more expensive. Maybe baller mushrooms?\", u'Serving Coney Island since 1924 it would be hard to call Totonno\\'s Pizzeria Napolitana anything less than an institution, and although the family-owned business was temporarily shuttered by a fire in 2009 and subsequently by Superstorm Sandy the place many say has been selling New York\\'s best Pizza for over 90 Years remains much the same as it ever has been, a renovation of the inside doing nothing to compromise the recipes and traditions of co-owner Antoinette Balzano\\'s Grandfather.\\n\\nOriginally founded by Anthony Pero and now in its third generation, either Antoinette or her sister Cookie Ciminieri usually present during the shop\\'s Thursday through Sunday noon to 8pm hours, Totonno\\'s has succeeded for years on the straightforward idea of serving only Pies made fresh from the very best ingredients available, the menu equally uncomplicated with just two choices - Small for $17.50 or Large for $20.50 with toppings each $2.50 extra.\\n\\nDecorated in old family photos, newspaper clippings and various nick-knacks, the sort of place where water is offered from a faucet behind the cooler and bathroom doorknob handles might unexpectedly fall off, those arriving early at Totonno\\'s are quickly suggested to sit down by one of the owners who can best be described as brief, if not extremely pleasant, with orders subsequently taken and yelled up to the counter where a middle aged man stretches the Dough and tops it before placing it in the Coal Oven.\\n\\nLoosing much in the hurricane, though the well-seasoned ovens thankfully remained intact, it is with waters filled once by staff that patrons wait in anticipation as the Pizzaiolo does his work, the space quickly filling up shortly after opening with the server mostly acting as traffic cop, directing customers where to sit and making sure that larger tables are saved for big groups.\\n\\nForced to obtain refills for oneself, the total time to make and fire a Pie approximately twenty minutes with perhaps four fitting the oven at once, it was in two smalls topped differently that five guests indulged, the Pepperoni a local butcher-bought variety sliced thin and mostly oilless while the housemade Sausage is crumbly and full of spice, also cut into rounds.\\n\\nContinuing to use coal in the era of wood and electric ovens, a conscious decision that imparts a peppery charred note to an edge that snaps and crackles before giving way to yeasty notes within, Totonno\\'s slice is not the floppy sort traditionally thought of as \"New York Pizza\" but instead robust and capable of remaining mostly upright without a fold, the Mozzarella a high-grade that bubbles without burning despite the oven\\'s high temperatures while the Sauce is entirely devoid of sweetness, instead letting the Tomatoes and Herbs do all the talking.\\n\\nFeaturing almost no Social Media presence, the owners clearly content in doing things the way they always have without compromise, Totonno\\'s is that rare \\'hidden gem\\' that has nonetheless been unearthed by word of mouth and subsequently confirmed by the Media, all of it going to show that even  in an Instagram world quality, passion and skill are the keys to creating a concept that is built to last.', u'Old school pepperoni pizza made in a coal oven. No frills, gimmicks, or crazy menu options here. Just some of the best, if not the best, pizza in NY. \\n\\nLove this place!!!\\n\\nNote: they have limited open hours and can run out of dough later in the day, so come early.', u\"I've been wanting to try this pizza for ages and good GOD, was it worth the wait. It seems easy to describe any old pizza as fantastic, but this one particularly is different from any other place in New York. I wanna say it's because of the sauce, but everything on the plate just worked so well together. So, so fucking good. Cannot wait to return. The salty service is hilarious and I love how low-maintenance it is as an establishment.\", u'I assume since the ratings were so high and listed as the \"#1 voted Pizza in NYC as per Food Network.\", my expectations/standards were high. But the pizza was alright. The sauce and fresh made mozzarella definitely made a difference in the taste. But I would not announce this as a #1 Pizza in NYC.  \\n\\nI liked that it was a family owned business, be prepared to only pay cash when you arrive and the menu is very simple.', u\"In making my first-ever visit out to Coney Island after living in the NY area for 20+ years, my wife did some research and happened upon Totonno's - a pizza place that is almost as legendary as the more well-known names (e.g. DiFara's) but was not one I had come across before. Even though it was in the middle of the afternoon - an odd time to be eating a meal - there was still a line out the door here, where you can either wait for a table to be seated at, or you can go in, place an order and come back to pick it up. Although we only waited about ~30 minutes to get seated, the pickup option would have definitely meant that our pizza came out sooner. They also don't share tables, meaning that my wife and I sat at a table for 6 and had it to ourselves...quite inefficient, IMO (although given the amount of time it takes for pies to come out, it would increase possibly awkward unplanned social interaction). The ambiance is one of an old-school NYC restaurant, with plenty of autographed photos abound, and you really get to take it in (and the Yankees game on the television) while waiting for your pizza(s) to be made. Ordering is pretty simple, although charging the full price for toppings on half a pizza is a pure money grab (and not hard arithmetically speaking). With the large merely $3 more than the small, you should get your money's worth (since it's expensive already) and get the large.\\n\\nWe ended up going with a large that was half cheese and half pepperoni, and perhaps the more surprising thing, IMO, that I took away from this is that the pizza does not have the feel of a thin-crust pizza. The crust may be marginally thicker than I would expect, but they are very generous in loading up on the mozzarella and the tomato sauce...so you get slices that have a decent amount of heft to them. I personally liked the pepperoni better, as it had a bit of spice to it, and the thin slices allowed the juicy oils of the pizza to collect on the top. While the cheese pizza is objectively very good on its own, I felt the sauce was lacking a bit of flavor (salt, perhaps? Maybe a larger sprinkling of pecorino was needed), making it a bit more of a slog to put away those slices later on. The cheese was fantastic, and while the tomato sauce was top-notch, it definitely could have had a little bit more on it.\\n\\nIn all - Totonno's is solid, but when I think about some of the other places I have had pizza at that I have waited in line for (so far, Grimaldi's before the folks left to open Julianna's, as well as DiFara's), I can't say that it's necessarily better, much less the best. It's still a fantastic pie, though, and if you are in Coney Island, it would be worth your stomach real estate to lay off the Nathan's and chow down here instead (or, better yet, call in for pickup).\", u\"I'm sure the pizzas fine but we didn't get that far. Biked down. Pushed my bike over to look inside the window to see how busy they were. Pushed my bike back over to the other side of the sidewalk to ask fellow bikers if they wanted to wait and this woman comes out and rudely tells us to use the bike parking and not lean anything against the window then disappears back inside. I get the 'old fashioned New York customer service' experience thing but jeez at least wait until someone does that or pop out and say if you're coming in could you please use the bike parking. Pass.\", u\"My cousins took us here when we were visiting over the Summer.  Great ol' skool family vibe.  Pizza was delicious too!\", u\"Best place in NYC for pizza, and that's saying a lot considering the wealth of great pizza there.\\nGet there early and on weekends, be prepared to wait in line...but it is absolutely worth it!\", u\"For my money, this landmark coal-fired pizza is the best you can get. Period. The moment it first went into my mouth I knew I'd reached the mountaintop. Everything is perfectly imperfect; the simple crushed tomato sauce, the fresh mozzarella splashed around the pie, the uneven char that gets all over your fingers. Every time I eat it I feel like I'm a little kid having pizza for the very first time. Are you going to get treated like a king? Nope. But they're not here to kiss your ass, they're here to make pizza, and if that's what you're there for you're in for something very, very special. \\n\\nI don't generally get toppings because I think it just distracts from the incredible crust, but if you do want one I suggest getting extra cheese; it's delicious and doesn't throw off the balance of the pie.\"], u'89.Nana Ramen': [u\"Love, Love, Love this place!!\\nFabulous food- have been here three times and been thoroughly impressed each time, as have the people who were with me.\\nThe staff is lovely, too, and the prices just fine.\\nIt's only inconvenience is its cash only- but they have an atm machine instore.\", u\"Welcomed addition to the neighborhood.\\n\\nDelicious ramen and great service.\\nI ordered the okonomiyaki to start and the spicy miso ramen. Great flavors and generous portions.\\n\\nHighly recommend and will be back! Would have given a 5 but was a little inconvenienced  that it's cash only.\", u'Yummy yummy! Get in my tummy. \\n\\nI will get a couple of the bad things (for me) out of the way first. 1. It\\'s a cash only place - I kind have a thing for restaurants that serve alcohol. 2. Nana Ramen does not serve sodas - I really had craving for a diet coke during my visit. Like I said earlier, these are things that annoy me, but they may affect other dinners. \\n\\nOn to the meat and potatoes of this review. I really enjoyed my Tan Tan (minced pork) with a 1/2 of a soft boiled egg (one dollar extra). I am not an expert in the ramen trends, but I found my dish to be very delicious. At first, I thought that the broth was a little bland, but the host/server gave me chilli sauce and all was good in the hood. The \"blandness\" was not a huge issue for me, because I tend to lean towards a little heat/spice with my food. \\n\\nThe restaurant, with its dim lighting and exposed walls, have an intimitate feel too it. The place is perfect for grabbing a quick, inexpensive meal with that special someone.', u\"I went here for a second time with friends but was underwhelmed. I got black tonkotsu ramen both times. The broth was too thick and oily and the boiled egg was cold. But the noodles were cooked perfectly. We shared the karaage and takoyaki. The takoyaki was very tasty but the portion was very small for the price. I loved the Japanese mayonnaise and the tonkatsu sauce combination on it! It's a good place to go if you just want average ramen. \\n\\nThe first time I went was for dinner and the restaurant was crowded. However the second time I went was for lunch and we were the only customers. They seemed to have turned off most of their lights in the restaurant and it felt very dark. I did appreciate the fact that they let us stay for a long time even after we finished our food. I'd go again out of convenience as many of my friends live near by but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to come here.\", u'Slurp...\"deliciousness\"...\\n\\nIn a shop with industrial modern decor, the restaurant turns out pretty amazing ramen. Ramen should be judged on the quality of the broth. If the ramen messed up the noodle, egg, pork, or any other ingredients, a travesty has been committed. Nana Ramen offers a simple menu where they know how to prepare food. I have tried a couple of their ramens (Shoyu & Black Tonkotsu). I\\'m still working my way through the menu. So far I have been impressed as the broths have been flavorful.  All the other ingredients were spot on in their preparation. Overall, a local spot that I enjoy very much. The staff is attentive. Now only if they accept credit cards, it would make my day.... #struggleofmoneyclipwallet', u\"We came in at 10:30 and the host was kind enough to sit us even though the kitchen was closing. I tried the first ramen on the menu. It seemed to be lacking in flavor. I loved the creaminess of the broth however. My boyfriend loved the spicy ramen. He said it had great flavor. \\nThe host was superrrrr nice, however, he was very sick. Coughing and sneezing, and never once washed his hands, I am a tad anal and watched him like a hawk. He served our ramen bowls with his thumb on the inner side of the bowl which really made me lose my appetite. \\nCash only which is kind of annoying, but not a deal breaker. \\nWould be back if I were in the area but other than that wouldn't travel far to come here. Very cute interior and great vibe!\", u\"I'm fairly new to the ramen scene having only tried a handful of restaurants and even so, only vegetarian broths (mushroom, shoyu, and matcha shoyu). So I'm not fully versed on who's who in the world of broths. \\n\\nNana Ramen has two actual vegetarian ramen options but the meat broths can be subbed for vegetable based broth . \\n\\nYasai shoyu (soy sauce based vegetable broth) topped with cauliflower, sprouts, tofu, and bamboo shoots. Nana Curry, which is a curry-like vegetable broth served with chashu (pork belly), but with the option to sub with tofu. The Kimchi ramen is a cold kimchi salad with no broth. \\n\\nI ordered the Nana Curry and replaced the chashu with tofu. I'm not sure if curry base is typical in ramen cuisine, but it was DELICIOUS. It reminded me of Thai red curry; decadent, rich with coconut milk and curry spices. The noodles were the curly type which are my favourite and the sprouts and scallion provided some crunch. \\n\\nI admit I did add some soy sauce and dehydrated garlic, which they conveniently have placed at each table, to jazz it up some and create a more explosive flavour, but even without, it was still pretty darn good til the last drop. \\n\\nThe interior is dimly lit and can provide an intimate feel or high table communal seating in the center of the restaurant for larger groups or solo diners. The waitstaff were attentive and helpful, taking time to explain the options on the menu. Do note, CASH ONLY. This always creeps up on me, but luckily ATMs are on site.\", u'Such a great place!! My first ramen spot. Service was amazing. Food was delicious!! We got the shrimp and chicken dumplings & I got the black t____ soup (sorry forgot the name) I will be back!!', u\"I'm like super excited that a ramen spot opened up within walking distance from our brownstone. I came here for lunch on my day off...I walked by here several times and this place is packed on weekends. Today one couple sat discreetly in the back whispering to one another barely looking up from their bowls of warm ramen.\\n\\nThis is a small space with a communal table to the right and tables to the left. This place seats less than 40 people.  Cool interior design and the lightening fixtures are hot.  \\n\\nThe menu is super simple appetizers and Ramen. \\n\\nThe Spicy Miso Ramen was rich, creamy, and spicy. The broth is thicker than most ramen spots in the area and I love it. The Spicy Miso Ramen does not come with egg. You can add an egg (half an egg) for $1.00. \\n\\nThe wait staff was attentive and friendly.  On weekdays they close at 3pm and reopens for the rush hour crowd at 5pm. \\n\\nI can not wait to bring my son.\\n\\n4 stars because they do not take plastic,  but the food and customer service are warm.\", u\"Bonus points for incredible service. Dude with a luscious looking ponytail kept on coming over and catering to my needs; it's like he taught customer service needs 101. \\n\\nOctopus: 5/5. (not to be confused with fried octopus balls) one of the best appetizers I've ever had. Straight up, straight down. It was tangy, the miso was a great touch, and the purple micro sprouts topped it all off aesthetically. Kinda pricy though.\\n\\nSpicy miso: (4.4/5) reminds me of the spicy miso at Chuko. It's got depth, bouncy firm noodles, and spicy sauces at your disposal -- and most importantly, a reserve of garlic flakes you can top it all off with. See photo where I'm channeling garlic bae. \\n\\nGyoza: My entire life has been an authentic gyoza fest, essentially. So the pork-chives combo was decent to me, but it didn't tickle me pink or anything. (If you're making gyozas at home, mix garlic, soy sauce & a bit of vinegar& scallions together to create the perfect dipping sauce. Trust me on this). \\n\\nPoints taken off (slipping below the threshold of the five star) for providing an odd number of things in the appetizers. How are you supposed to sit down with a hot date, and distract him for only so long with stuff you talked about on Tinder until you both realize in horror that you will need to tug-of-war for that last piece? You quickly notice this isn't some Game of Thrones ish and you either sheepishly need to slice the remaining piece of land in hopes that you'll do it right or be accused of being a stingy Stan. \\n\\nI hope people don't start swarming here and taking up this place because I've claimed it, it's my Westeros or whatever.\", u\"Happy to see a ramen joint open up in this neighborhood! Especially if it's walking distance from my house! Woot woot!\\n\\nSmall space with a communal table to the right and tables to the left. Cool industrial interior design. \\n\\nThe menu is super simple. Small dishes and ramen. \\n\\nBlack Tonkotsu is my go-to Ramen and I'm glad it's prepared well. The broth was good and not too salty with a good amount of noodles in the dish. Simple yet satisfying. \\n\\nI do wish they give you the full egg instead of half. The egg is the best part. \\n\\nThe staff was attentive; came by several times to fill my glass. \\n\\nCash only. \\n\\nWill be back to try other dishes on the menu.\", u\"-Interior is very nice\\n-CASH ME INSIDE (cash only :(....)\\n-Great thick ramen (not very spicy though)\\n-Octopus and Gyoza were on point very very tasty. The spices used were perfecto.\\n-ODD NUMBER OF PIECES FOR the 3 of us. WHY. :(\\n-Enthusiastic waiter, maybe too much for my taste. I'm mid-chew bro.\\n-Ambient music and weird house vibes. I dig it.\\n-Relatively fast service.\\n\\nI'd come back. If not to engorge myself on the 5 pieces of octopus provided.\", u\"Finally! I've been walking by the space for months and it's finally open! \\n\\nI came on opening day, rainy and perfect for ramen slurping. I came on the early side and was surprised at how many people were there - apparently I wasn't the only one in anticipation mode. \\n\\nI started with edamame, the fried octopus balls, mackeral, and the dried squid tempura. The octopus was amazing - crunchy on the outside, gooey on the inside, and topped with savory bonito flakes. The mackerel had a perfect crispy skin. The squid tempura was interesting - very chewy, and I wished it had some kind of sauce for dipping. \\n\\nMoving on to ramen, I had the black tonkatsu broth. The black comes from the use of black garlic and the broth is so rich. The pork is cut thick and fatty and I wished I had ordered extra. I also tried the spicy miso and it certainly lives up to its name. \\n\\nThey don't have alcohol yet, but plan to offer beer and sake soon.\", u\"This is a very solid ramen shop.  It's not my favorite in New York, but definitely a favorite here in Brooklyn (It's also only a 10 minute walk from me and right off of the Utica Ave stop when I'm headed home on chilly night so you can't really beat that.  Their pricing is good and the portions are hefty.  These two things together are beautiful in the realm of creating a returning customer such as myself.  They've also got a nice lineup of beers and wines for you to choose from during your dining experience.\\n\\nThe place is cozy and intimate but doesn't feel small.  In addition to tables for two against the wall there is also a dining island for those parties of one who want to eat out as well but not stick out like sore thumbs who couldn't even get a date come have ramen with them (who says no to ramen?).  In addition to their lovely pork based broths they've actually got quite a few vegetarian options on the menu as well, making this a pretty friendly place for most if not all palettes.  I look forward to my next stop in here soon.\", u\"The service and decor is nice. 2 stars for that. The food is so whack though! I've had cheaper and better ramen in New York. I don't really understand the appeal. Am I missing something here? I don't understand how this place exists\", u\"First time there it was wow! Second time no wow, just so-so. I'll give them one more chance to perform. Friendly staff, cash only. ATM inside\", u'I came here with my mom to celebrate her birthday. She never tried traditional ramen and this place tasted very authentic. For appetizers we ordered octopus and they had a special of the day which was the okonomiyaki. It was goooooood. I ordered the spicy miso ramen and my mom had the black tonkatsu\\u200b ramen. The tonkatsu was ok and the ramen was on the thick side. The miso ramen stole the show. It had that nice spicy kick and I like that the ramen for this was thinner and cooked perfectly. I will definitely come back in the winter to see if there will be any menu updates or add-on.', u'delicious, so glad it is here. walking distance from my house.\\n\\nthe menu is the perfect size. I have only tried the vegetarian broth option, Yasai Shuyo, I am not a fan of tofu so i ordered it without and added a boiled egg. I was completely full and satisfied.  During my first visit I ordered the shrimp shumai with my mom, we split it and quickly decided that was the wrong move...get your own order! She ended coming back for another order later on that evening. We learned from our mistake the second time around and ordered 2!!!\\n\\ncash only so bring enough and enjoy!!!!', u\"Finally....finally....our neighborhood of Bed Stuy had given us a reason to never leave. This is not happening a moment too soon because it is freezing (most days) and the desire to go outside becomes less and less. The Gyoza and all of the Ramen soups are amazing. Great place right off of a busy street, but it is surprisingly quiet. If you are hoping to go there for lots of space, this isn't the place but their food more than makes up for the size. If this restaurant were a date, it be the cute little guy in the corner that happens to be a great kisser. Give him a try.\", u\"Lovvvveeeeww this place! The Spicy Miso is delicious! Been here 4 or 5 times already. Great ambience and friendly staff. It's cash only but well worth the extra stop at the ATM.\"], u'112.Nicandra\\u2019s': [u\"One of the finest Italian dinners I've experienced.  Pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauces were light yet flavorful without being too salty.  \\n\\nService was lovely and the transparency of seeing the kitchen is very refreshing.\\n\\nGo, you won't be disappointed.\\n\\nP.S. The ribs fall off the bone like nowhere I've seen.\", u\"Came in last night for my husband's birthday after finding Nicandra's on Yelp. \\n\\nWe had an amazing experience. The place is intimate and small. The menu is short and to the point (love that). The hostess / manager was lovely and very friendly, not pretentious at all. For apps my husband and I ordered the wild mushroom & short ribs, respectively. While we both felt they took a little long to come out (15+ min) when they arrived they were mouthwatering perfection. I think if they provided some bread & olive oil/butter upon seating any wait would go unnoticed. \\nThe entree came right after the app which was great. I'm not sure the correct name of my entre but the pasta was black, and it had lobster and lemon juice. My husband had a pasta dish with pulled duck and raisins. So my husband's entree was one of the best things I have ever tasted in my life. It was perfect. Seriously. My entree was delicious as well. However, my lobster was a wee bit overdone- but I didn't care because the food was on another level, besides that. We also had the pleasure of having the creme br\\xfbl\\xe9e. It was the best creme br\\xfbl\\xe9e I have ever had, light, decadent and evenly caramelized- which at some of the best of restaurants I've dined at they haven't accomplished. \\n\\nMy husband and I we're running late with our sitter so we cancelled our reservation at Smith & Wollensky and I was so worried my husband's birthday wasn't going to be what we hoped. Nicandra's saved the day with delicious, delicious food, great atmosphere and a wonderful host & server. We will be returning. I must taste the rest of their menu and revisit my new faves.\", u\"A pleasant surprise. \\n\\nUnexpectedly ended up here with my girlfriend; hungry and tired of overhyped restaurant/food experiences, we were hopeful but lacking expectation when we arrived at Nicandra's on this Saturday evening. \\n\\nThe restaurant was bustling (~23 seats), but we were greeted immediately and told we would be seated without reservation. \\n\\nOnce tables were cleared, we were given our choice of seating and our meal commenced. \\n\\nWe decided to try both side vegetables (broccolini and asparagus), as well as 3 pasta dishes: squid ink linguini (specially served with shrimp instead of lobster), the fazzoletti with brown butter sage sauce and spring vegetables, and cavatelli with red sauce and zucchini. \\n\\nWhat a great treat! Everything was handled with delicacy and care. It was difficult to pick a favorite dish, and we cleared all of our plates. \\n\\nWe look forward to trying the desserts and other plates. My only disappointment is not having taken photos to share the deliciousness on Yelp before we ate everything up!\\n\\nCharmaine, the front of house partner/owner, was delightful - we felt very comfortable and loved the ambiance; from the lighting and art, down to the music --and most certainly the food -- Nicandra's hits close to home in many ways, and we will certainly return with friends!\", u\"Food and flavors were out of this world!\\n\\nIf you love pasta you have to go to this restaurant, it's honestly the best pasta I ever had. The place is small and can be very crowded, but it's so worth it.\\n\\nAny of there dishes are great and have complex delicious flavors. Do you can't go wrong. I do recommend the mushroom appetizer which is my favorite thing on the whole menu.\\n\\nNo liquor license yet so BYOB!\", u\"Came here for dinner with a friend. It's a small pasta shop that is only open for dinner and brunch. They make their pasta fresh in house every day. We ordered the Cacio E Pepe and the Squid Ink pasta w shrimp. Both were fantastic. We wanted some spice and they were both very tasty.  We had the creme br\\xfbl\\xe9e for dessert which was also verrry good! Want to come back and try more pasta. Service was also very friendly and made us feel very comfortable.\", u\"This place is pretty much perfect. The fresh flowers on the table are an elegant touch that enhances the vibe of the meal and also plays on the freshly prepared nature of all of the simply elegant dishes that the chef prepares.\\n\\nWith all that being said, I came to this seemingly hidden Bushwick spot with 0 expectations. A friend invited me to a spot that her best friend co-managed and I wasn't even very hungry nor did I want to spend much money (I'd gladly come back and give them all of my money).  Where do I begin? I was privileged enough to meet the chef as there is an open kitchen located towards the front of the restaurant. Passerbys can look in (and creepily take pictures from the street) at the chef and his small staff hard at work preparing greatness. There's front window countertop style seating, and then a lightly generous amount of seating for at least one decent sized group and a smaller one of individual date night type situations.\\n\\nThe food is amazing!  I (heavily) sampled like 5 different dishes and they were all equally amazing with no exaggeration. The names are hard to remember but I took photos of each and got the name right in the pictures so peruse them at the bottom of this review. A standout was the mushroom appetizer with the fried egg. It was the best thing I'd eaten all month and i typically don't like mushrooms and I was so reluctant to try it. I'd go back just for it.  The pasta is perfectly made. Also the charcuterie is spot on and delicious. I was so busy enamored by the food that I missed the drink menu completely so I have no clue what they have to offer in that department. Vegetarians are welcomed also.\\n\\nI'm going back soon!\", u'Food is consistently amazing. Employees are extremely nice and do what they can to make my experience better than anything I expect.', u\"We had Charred broccolini\\nAsparagus with lemon vinaigrette for appetizers.  The broccolini was everyone's favorite.  The carbonara was delicious & we brought bottled sparkling water to drink. I'd go back here for sure.  Reservations are a good idea because it's pretty popular.\", u'Awesome brunch. My friend had the avocado toast with lox and it was an amazing deal for the amount and quality of the fish! I also enjoyed my fettuccine carbonara, but the toast was definitely the best. Only complaint is that the iced coffee was kind of weak. Cute little place!', u'The food was really good but there was a women working who was pretty rude. I noticed when others came in who she respected her attitude changed for them. Makes a big difference to just be compassionate to every person who walks in.', u\"Decided to come here for date night and absolutely loved it! The pork rib appetizer was enough to share between the 2 of us and it literally melted off the bone. For mains, we had the squid ink pasta and the duck pasta. Both were really delicious and perfectly flavored. To finish, we had the creme br\\xfbl\\xe9e for desert. Service was great, fast and really friendly. \\n\\nThe place is small and intimate, so do make a reservation if you are coming in larger groups. It's also BYOB, so come prepared!\", u\"This is the best Italian restaurantt in the neighborhood, or even in Brooklyn for that matter. The duck and the squid ink pasta dishes were absolutely amazing! The pasta was clearly freshly made and tasted divine. They gave us a parmesan amuse bouche that was to dye for. I cannot wait to come back and try more dishes. FYI it's BYOB\", u'Homemade pasta was delicious! I had the squid ink pasta and my boyfriend had the pappardelle duck ragu. They were both delicious, but the I think the duck ragu was a smidge better because the flavors were a really unique and tasty combination.', u\"Love  this place. The first time I dined here, was on a double date with friends. The wine was flowing, as was the conversation. It was a great wind down after the stresses of work. \\n\\nI had the squid ink pasta, which I usually like with a cream sauce so I wasn't blown away. But I had a bite of my friend's carbonara and immediately wanted to come back for more. \\n\\nSo here I am with bae, taking a break from packing up our apartment, looking forward to our move to the other side of Brooklyn, excited for new beginnings and for the noms we are about ensue. \\n\\nAnd the server just brought us an Amuse Bouche!! What a nice surprise. \\n\\nThe pasta is fresh, drink as much wine as you can bring in the door, and have a good laugh with a lover or friends. Major noms!\", u\"This spot is amazing for brunch! Eggs were cooked to perfection both sunny side up and the eggs benedict! The steak was NY strip and so tender and juicy, seasoned just right! Also the creme br\\xfbl\\xe9e was to die for! definitely recommend for brunch, the fresh handmade pasta looked amazing as well, will definitely try lunch or dinner next time i'm in the area!\", u\"Noticed this was a new restaurant addition on Irving for a few months and finally had the chance to pop in for an early dinner. The interior is small and quaint, one of the nicer, newer and semi upscale restaurants on the block with plenty of natural light coming in from their all window store front. Inside seats probably around 20 and a few stool seats against the window. Since they are a new establishment and still working out their liquor license (I'm assuming), they welcome BYOB with no corkage fee!\\n\\nAll of their pasta is made fresh in house and everything on the menu sounded really tasty. At first glance of their Yelp pics, I thought their servings were a little on the smaller side. I went with the papperdelle dish which came with duck ragu, black raisins and parmesan. The duck was tender and complimented the al dente texture of the papperdelle well. I do wish it was a little more saucy, but it was light and airy. It turned out to be a good amount, I was full but not overly stuffed.\\n\\nMy friend had the fetuccine carbonara, asparagus, crispy pancetta with an egg yolk. We also decided to share a side of the charred broccolini which was a nice fresh balance to our pasta. We both enjoyed our meal and were too full for dessert, but I also hear they make all their dessert from scratch so will have to try next time!\\n\\nOverall had a good experience here. The server was very knowledgable about their menu and checked in on us often. Great addition to the Bushwick neighborhood that offers a unique dining experience you'd typically have to go to the city for.\", u'Totally shocked that the place was empty at 12:30 pm on this gorgeous Saturday but so not complaining that this cute little gam had no astronomical wait time - they do take reservations btw as we\\'re told dinner time gets pretty busy and the space is small. \\nNicandra\\'s is cozy, and inviting, and unpretentious.  Love the music too!\\nThe brunch menu had so many amazing choices, had the hardest time making decisions - too bad \"items 1 through 7 please\" wasn\\'t a realistic option!  Great to see a brunch menu that consists of things other than your usual steak and eggs (though that is present) and french toast.  \\nWe decided on a burrata with prosciutto as an appetizer; as for entrees it was polenta with shrimp ragu and poached eggs, and black ink linguini with shrimp.  Everything was simply perfection - the buttery softness of the burrata, perfectly poached eggs over creamy polenta with \"just enough of a kick\" ragu, flawlessly executed homemade black ink linguini.  For dessert, my friend couldn\\'t resist the crepes with fruits - did not disappoint.  \\nNothing like a great brunch to set the rest of the day! Thank you Nicandra\\'s, we\\'ll be back!', u'My girlfriend and I went here Friday night. I had finally tracked down some cash that was owed to me, and was trying to spend it as quickly as possible on the most sumptuous of meals. Alas, though Nicandra\\'s fit the bill on the latter, it was quite affordable!\\n\\nI called Friday afternoon for an 8:30 PM reservation, and Charmaine put me down. As it turns out, Charmaine works the whole house:  She sat us when we came in, and then served us the entire meal. She was extremely kind and personable.\\n\\nWe started with the burrata and the glazed pork ribs. The burrata was excellent, freshly kneaded and atop a bed of tiny, cool fresh greens. The pork ribs all but changed my world. Huge portion, so tender that when you forked them the meat slid cleanly away from the bone, and desperately needed by my lady and I, as we\\'d allowed ourselves to get a little shaky before the 8:30 start time.\\n\\nFor dinner, we split the pappardelle and the gnudi -- Charmaine\\'s first- and third-favorites, mind you. The pappardelle was the freshest pasta I\\'ve had in some time. The raisins made my girlfriend, upon discovery, squeal with the delight. The sweetness and texture paired so well with this dish. The gnudi was excellent, too -- similar to what you might think of as a \\'gnocchi\\', and topped with a huge portion of braised oxtail. Filling and delicious. We just passed our bowls back and forth throughout the meal like savages. \\n\\nBYOB. At the lady\\'s request, I\\'d brought along a bottle of \"Sav B\", which paired nicely with our choices. Though at the end of the meal, our booze buzz paled in comparison to the high we got from such a choice culinary experience. I\\'m NOT a pasta aficionado, but this food, to me, is even better than Missy Robbins\\'s Lilia -- if that means anything to you. Regardless, Nicandra\\'s is taking the Myrtle-Wyckoff food scene to the next level.', u\"I had the pleasure of stopping by for dinner this weekend.\\nThis place is wonderful. Our favorites were the mushroom appetizer that everyone talks about, the duck ragu pappardelle and the chocolate dessert. Service was impeccable and friendly!\\nRemember it's BYO :)\", u\"absolutely divine meal here one cool summer night.  I didn't realize it was BYOB, so note to self for next time.  The entire menu looked amazing - we settled on sharing pork ribs to start. Falling off the bone, delicious.  It came with six ribs so enough for the two of us to share without feeling cheated.  I got the fazzoletti with brown butter sage and summer veg - really delightful and a hearty portion.  All pastas are made in house and it showed.  My husband got the pappardelle with duck ragu, also a big hit.  There was also a really delightful amuse bouche at the beginning, a foamed parmesan cream that was a really nice start to the meal.  I wish we'd had room for dessert.\\n\\nA very intimate little place, cozy and great for a low key date night or communing with friends.  We also didn't break the bank on dinner, which was a nice ending to the meal. :)\"], u'32.Uglyduckling': [u\"Luckily, we easily found a parking spot near the restaurant. We arrived on a Sunday around 2pm and didn't have to wait for a table. Service was exceptional from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. From the brunch menu, we ordered the fried chicken and waffles, as well as the shrimp and grits; we also ordered deviled eggs and shoestring fries. For drinks, my boyfriend had a Mimosa and I had a Sangria. My Sangria was perfect - not too strong, not too weak, not too acidic, not too sweet. \\n\\nMy boyfriend really enjoyed his deviled eggs. The shoestring fries were crispy and packed with flavor - garlic and herbs. I've yet to try better fries than at Balthazar, but these, although different, take the #2 spot for me. \\n\\nThe fried chicken was incredibly moist (ugh I hate that word... but ... the chicken was... moist). It was well-seasoned from the first bite to the last. I wouldn't compare it to the fried chicken I had in Memphis, but I've never had better fried chicken in NYC. Same thing for the shrimp and grits. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. For a shrimp and grits dish, it was surprisingly light (in a good way). Whenever I'm the mood for either dish, this is the spot I'm going to. \\n\\nOverall, we were impressed and will definitely be back.\", u\"Loved the food here! Came here for dinner with the family on a Friday early evening (5:45pm) and was seated immediately. FYI- Mostly family with little kids eating at this time so come early if you don't want to wait.\\n\\nWe had the calamari salad to start and chicken with waffles, crab cake for entree.\\nThe calamari salad is fried calamari mixed into mesclun greens with feta, olives and banana peppers. This was so delicious! They give a lot of calamari so definitely share this or get it as a main.\\nChicken and waffles- deliciously season chicken (not dry) over crisp fluffy waffles. Just remember to take a pic (for IG) as soon as this dish comes out and take the hot chicken off the waffle! If not, the heat will cause the chicken to be less crispy and the waffles to start getting soft. \\nCrab cake - yes singular! You get 1 cake on top of asparagus spears, side salad and corn with bean salsa. This was good with real crab meat and not a lot of fillers but not sure if it's worth $25. \\n\\nThe one thing that bothered us was the service. They only bought 2 small glasses of water for me and my husband and didn't bring anything for my 4.5 year old daughter. Plus they never came by to refill our water unless the half bottle of stale water on our table was it. Honestly couldn't figure out if that was for decor? For the vase of flowers? Or for us to drink?\", u\"So this review is based on the food. I ordered the salmon and pepper bacon with Mac and cheese. \\nSalmon-cooked well veggies that accompanied it were good\\nPepper bacon-doesn't actually taste like it has pepper, just has black flakes on it. Decent serving size though.\\nMac and cheese- presentation is awesome, but lacking in the flavor dept. If you are a mac and cheese connoisseur then you won't be amazed. \\n My friend had the salmon blt which she loved and also seems to be a popular item.\", u\"Gloriously amazing dishes for brunch! We came by here for brunch at about 3pm (still serving). We got sat down quickly and was treated nicely. I ordered the pull pork benedict which I have been craving for a while. My first time here btw. The pull pork benedict was delicious in every way. The pork wasn't overly salty as the way i like it ans it was soft ans chewy. My husband ordered the burger which was extremely juicy and flavorable. Nice fries and their sauce compliment well with the food. Definitly coming back for more to try and highly recommended.  \\nAtmosphere was relaxing, chilling, and comfortable.\", u\"They have all the best foods here under one roof! Burgers, fried chicken, chicken wings, fries and fried calamari. Perhaps adding a pizza would make it the ultimate place to eat daily. \\n\\nI ordered the brisket burger, it was a tad salty but super delicious and satisfying. The fries were among the best fries I have ever had. That ugly sauce is good stuff. My girlfriend ordered the fried chicken and waffles, the chicken breast was as freaking moist as a soaked bounty wipe. All that in the best way! The waffle was my favorite waffle out of all the fried chicken and waffles I have sampled. I couldn't forgot about the fried calamari, olives, arugula, fried calamari and vinegary goodness. Most unique take on fried calamari and it definitely works. The fried chicken wings were exactly what you expect from a buffalo wing. Overall everything here was absolutely delightful, maybe a little too salty at some bites but I would definitely come back again. \\n\\nAlso great service with smiling faces, cant forget that!\", u\"Uglyduckling is not so ugly! The food here is all presentable and pretty and the servers are all very attentive.\\n\\nFor appetizers:\\nWe had the fried calamari and the chicken wings. The fried calamari was different from other places that serve fried calamari. It was mixed with salad and olives and some dressing that the calamari did not need sauce to be dipped with! The salad and the calamari meshed well together and I could not stop eating it. The servings were HUGE. It was more of an entree itself!\\nThe chicken wings- there are 3 flavors you can choose from. I think each order comes with about 8-10 wings. I'm not too sure of the amount. The options include Thai chili, dry cajun, and buffalo. We had the dry cajun and the buffalo and it was very good. They were a bit spicy but if you can handle the spice, def try! I personally liked the dry cajun and thought that the buffalo was good but didn't really stand out.\\n\\nFor the entree:\\nI had their famous chicken and waffles. They serve a huge serving of chicken. It had maybe 3 BIG pieces of chicken and delicious waffle. The waffle and the syrup wasn't overly sweet, nor dry. The chicken was juicy and not dry either. I secretly enjoyed their chicken and waffles better than pies n thighs :x \\n\\nOverall, this place is a really great place to come if you're around the area! Chicken and waffles is popular here so you can't go wrong!\", u\"This is one of my favorite place to go to for brunch. There's no ridiculous long waiting game before you get to sit down and order away to your heart's desire.\\n\\nTwo of the dishes that stood out on my visits here were the fried chicken & waffles (you must get) and the smoked ugly. Both are the highlights from their brunch menu to be honest, and I'm trying so hard not to be bias about letting you know that of the two, fried chicken and waffles are the better choice. I only mentioned that because I love fried chicken but like I said, not trying to be bias, so those are the top two dishes to get when you're here!\\n\\nService is friendly, they have several TV's for game watching and a nice bar area to watch the TVs.\", u\"The chicken n waffles are awesome!!!!! I split it with a few people but would definitely order it as a main dish next time. I had the salmon blt sans bacon and really enjoyed it. I'll be back!\", u\"Love this place. Their happy hour special sangria is sweet and refreshing for only $5. Can't get better than that! Food: mac and cheese - creamy, cheese and gooey. Shoe string fries are too die for, a combination of potatoes and sweet potatoes cut finely and fry to perfection, can't get enough of them.... sooo goood!\\nYou can skip the nachos. They were meh, bland and nothing out of the ordinary. I can't wait to go back and try their chicken wings, they surely good yummy!\", u'The food was just okay in my opinion, but I do like the name of this place.\\nMaybe it\\'s supposed to be a hidden message, like \"our food is ugly, but it\\'s beautiful inside.\" Idk lol. \\n\\nAnyways we came here around 1p.m for Sunday brunch and got seated within 10 mins! Not bad considering it was Sunday lol. We ordered 2 of the deviled eggs, a waffle chicken sandwich, pulled pork Benedict, tacos, and a burger. \\n\\nThe deviled eggs were very unsatisfying. I\\'m usually the one that picks up the 2nd deviled egg wanting more, but after one of these I wasn\\'t craving for another one. \\n\\nThe waffle chicken sandwich wasn\\'t bad, the chicken was a little spicy but it gave that nice kick and they put pepper bacon inside. The fries were delicious though! But fries are always good lol. \\n\\nMy bf was meh about his pulled pork Benedict. He said nothing special stood out to him about his food which is surprising since it looked like there was so much flavor in it. \\n\\nThe waiter was nice though, and even if the food wasn\\'t as good at least the service was!', u\"My friends and I came over from Queens for chicken and waffle. Parking in the area is nearly impossible, at least on a Friday afternoon. We got there soon after it opened so there weren't many people there and plenty of seating. We ordered the chicken and waffles and the pulled pork sandwich. The chicken was so good! It was a pretty big piece of chicken and it was super juicy. I'd go back for just the fried chicken. The waffle itself was pretty good. Nothing too special. I liked that the syrup wasn't too sweet. The pulled pork sandwich was also pretty good. In general I liked the food but the prices were on the higher end. I would definitely come back if I were in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way for it again.\\n\\nWhen I went there was a $5 happy hour going on. I believe it included sangria, beer and something else. The place itself is pretty cute. I definitely liked the atmosphere. There are also 2 bathrooms!\", u'Came here with two of my girl friends tonight because one of them were craving fries and I remembered that they had decent shoestring fries.\\n\\nThe atmosphere here is very chill.  The music is loud and the tables are kind of close together, so my friends and I really had to project our voices.  As for the food, the dinner menu seems a bit limited in my opinion because I took a while deciding what I wanted.  I can definitely say  that the deviled eggs hit the spot, but my personally customized order of grilled chicken was just mediocre, especially since it was a tad bit pricey.  The chicken and waffles seem to be the highlight of this place, which I really enjoyed my first time around.  My friends both ordered burgers and they were overall happy with the order.\\n\\nOverall, this place is worth trying!  My waitress tonight was very accomodating and pleasant, which really improved the experience of dining here.', u'A friend and I stopped in for dinner last week. \\nThe space is great as was the food - we had the shrimp and grits which were delicious.\\nMy only complaint is the service. The waitress was very nice by she was the only 1 working that evening. She sat us down and we waited 15 minutes for menus and another 15 for her to come back and take our orders. Totally unacceptable.', u\"Stopped in for a low-key weeknight dinner a couple weeks back. Dinner menu was fine but nothing very exciting. We had the fried calamari, chicken wings and the salmon. Portions were very generous, but the food was mostly forgettable. Chicken wings were heavily sauced and spicy but too sweet and the chicken itself was a little listless (probably overdone?). The Mediterranean calamari was an interesting alternative to your usual fried calamari offering but it tasted a bit soggy; ultimately we ended up only finishing about half the serving. The salmon was well prepared but nothing spectacular. \\n\\nOn top of that there were a few hiccups with the service; it seems like we were seated during a handoff or shift change and so our actual server didn't see that we were waiting for quite some time. Not really their fault though and they were profusely apologetic about it so not holding it against them too badly. \\n\\nHonestly can't see myself coming back for dinner given the overall experience, but they do have a good beer menu so perhaps I'll be back for a pint.\", u\"This place was delicious!  Had the lobster, shrimp, asparagus, mushroom risotto.  It was perfect.\\n\\nI wish I had room for desert but I'll have to try it on my next visit.\\n\\nThe beer flight bartender choice came out with good selections, cider was delicious as well.\\n\\nCan't wait to try something different next time!\", u\"Great food. Ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was very crispy and seasoned well. Also very juicy. The syrup and waffle were a perfect combo.\\n\\nGirlfriend got the egg white omlete, pretty run of the mill. Egg whites were fluffy with a hint of butter which didn't over power the omlete. The mushrooms within tasted great.\\n\\nI'd come back here again\", u\"Strolled in on a Saturday afternoon for brunch around 1pm with a party of 3. Seated immediately. It filled up more when we left. Waiter was very friendly. \\nStarted off with the Hawaiian coffee. They have a good selection of adult brunch drinks. The Hawaiian coffee was better than the Irish coffee.\\nWe tried the deviled eggs, sausage, and the smoked ugly with pulled pork. The sausage was the best. Crispy skin but tender deliciousness on the inside. The deviled eggs were nothing spectacular but the greens on top of them were tasty. The dressing for the greens is really good and light! The smoked ugly was filling and the poached eggs were made to perfection. The potatoes they came with was mediocre. Overall I had a good experience and didn't feel rushed enjoying my Saturday brunch! Would come again!\", u'A BIG Thumbs up to the Manager/host. He was super sweet for reserving a table for me when I called to see how long was the wait.. I was sat right away when I arrived to the restaurant for a table of 4. \\n\\nWe all started off with drinks: 2 Ugly Marys (which is a bloody mary) ($8 each), 1 Mimosa ($8) and 1 Rushing duck st out nitro ($8). Highly recommend trying their Ugly Mary.\\n\\nFor our main course, we ordered: Smoked Ugly ($16) - Poached eggs with smoked pulled pork, hollandaise with a side of house salad and home fries, Eggs Norwegian ($19) - Fresh Norwegian smoked salmon, poached eggs, hollandaise with a side of house salad and home fries, Breakfast Sandwich ($18) - cheddar cheese waffle, fried chicken, fried egg with a side of fries , Chicken & Waffles ($16) - fried chicken, Belgian waffles and a side order of bacon ($5) and non-alcoholic ugly mary ($5) Total = $124.12. \\n\\nMy friend had the chicken and waffles and he said the chicken was not dry at all. My bf had the smoked ugly which he liked the twist of having pulled pork with eggs benedict. Definitely not your average eggs benedict. I had the Eggs Norwegian which is something i normally get for brunch. The eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise was buttery and creamy.', u\"It's hard to describe my feelings about Ugly Duckling. Honestly, it is very forgettable. Nothing really creates a memorable feeling. The food is okay. The drinks are fine. The environment and ambiance is a warm wood factory-esque vibe.\\n\\nService was fine. The staff was friendly. \\n\\nI could go into detail... but... it just is. Nothing bad about it, but nothing memorable. I would recommend elsewhere.\", u\"Amazing amazing brunch!! \\n\\nCame on a Saturday about 1pm and not a huge wait! Which was great, because our original place was at least a 40 minute wait. Love their brunch cocktails $4 draft and $8 cocktails! \\nI ordered he frenchtoast! Came with two pieces of French toast with bananas and cheese inside! The bread was crunchy! And came with a side of fruit! \\n\\nWe also ordered the famous chicken and waffles! The only complaint is the waffle wasn't crispy enough, or warm enough! The chicken was good! Not dry at all! Fried and enough to share with two people! \\n\\nThe breakfast chicken waffle sandwich was not bad as well! Waffle as the bread between the pieces was fried chicken, egg and bacon! Can't ask for more in a waffle sandwich! \\n\\nString potato fries a must as well! Combination of potatoes and sweet potato string fries! Must order! Amazing find on this place!\"], u'57.Bogota Latin Bistro': [u\"I always have great food and drinks, and tonight we had the pleasure of sitting in Juan's section. He's genuinely nice, attentive, and makes great recommendations.\\n\\nGreat food, strong drinks, and outstanding service - I love this place.  See ya soon!\", u'Visiting Brooklyn and ordered delivery based on Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed! \\n\\nExcellent vegetarian and gluten free options. \\n\\nPatacon Garlic Shrimp: yummy! Heads up: Loads of garlic on this one! \\nPatacon con todos: least fav of the dishes as it was a bit salty and dry, but we ate over half of it anyway. \\nVegetarian plate with three sides (plaintain fried, maduros, spinach) - enough for two people to share when you add lentil soup. Everything prepared well, fresh and delicious. \\nQuinoa cakes: unusual but very good! \\nChicken sancocho: highlight of our meal, comforting and delicious with big pieces of chicken, corn, plantain and yucca. Big enough to share. \\nLentejas soup was also very good. \\n\\nWould definitely recommend this place to others and would eat here again.', u\"So though I've been patronizing this business for what seems like over 10 yrs.\\nI will likely never come here again and that makes me sad as I love their food.\\nThey have this random rule now that your credit/debit must have a chip to use there.\\nI happen to bank with 2 credit unions by choice.\\nNeither has the chip system yet.\\nI definitely have numerous cards and IDs that bear my name.\\nBut to suggest I walk to Chase to get cash, which is not my bank and incur 2 fees just to get cash, so that I can have a yummy dinner and way too many Sangritas is definitely pushing it.\\nI'm soooooooo turned off, I so wanted my Tres Leche cake, and Cilantro Mash Potatoes, Snapper and Coconut Rice.\\nBut alas no chip, no business from me.\\nSo be warned bring cash or bust.\", u\"I was excited to try this place since I have had it bookmarked for such a long time. Leaving Atlantic Mall after getting a few things, I figured why not walk down to Bogota Latin Bistro and get some dinner? \\n\\nHere are the highlights:\\n\\n1.) Once I arrived there, I asked to be placed at the bar until my +1 meets me and then we would like to be moved to a table. The hostess was very nice and sat me right away. \\n\\n2.) Bogota Latin Bistro ' s atmosphere is warm and inviting with colorful artwork/decor on the walls, hanging from the ceiling etc. \\n\\n4.) Staff were extremely accommodating,  helpful in answering our questions about menu items, etc.\\n\\n5.) Bogota Latin Bistro has a fantastic cocktail menu! Oh My Goodness....the menu has various Margaritas, Sangrias, Mojitos etc. I finally decided to order their Passion Fruit Margarita and yes it was wonderful!\\n\\n6.) The Fish Tacos (I tried some of it as the person I was with ordered it)....All I can say is that you should consider getting the Fish Tacos meal as your entree. Such divine tasting Spinach! \\n\\nThe Arroz Con Pollo left a bit to be desired. However, if I ever return to Bogota Latin Bistro there are other things that I would try on the menu...oh yeah and I will definitely have more of their yummy cocktails!\", u'Came here with a group of friends for dinner last night. Our server Eric was wonderful, very attentive and the food was amazing. We got there empanada sampler I only tried the guava which was delicious. Based on previous reviewers we knew the portion sizes were large so we shared the Columbian platter which was plentiful. Overall good food + good service I would definitely come back here again to try some of their other dishes.', u'Brunch. I believe this is the perfect route to take for an adult gathering for large groups. With that being said, a buddy of mine chose this as her birthday venue, and I was anxious because my first visit years back didn\\'t go so well. We arrived, and in typical fashion, everyone wasn\\'t there and we had to wait to be seated. We were a group of 9, but they finally allowed us to sit with just six.\\n\\nWe were taken to the back where they have a few large tables, but the seats were too close together. Luckily, everyone wasn\\'t there and we were able to use this to our advantage and \"spread out\". The sever came over shortly thereafter, and initially she seemed fine, but other people at the party overheard her making some negative remarks during the course of the time we were there. I\\'m not exactly sure what was stated verbatim, but it rubbed three people the wrong way. Also, she was a bit aggressive about getting us to get more alcohol. I know that\\'s typical, but I get she was a bit too pushy.\\n\\nThe food itself was ok, but nothing greater than that. I started off with beef empanadas, as we all ordered our own appetizer. My entree was steak and eggs; it was edible-- but nothing to write home about. I\\'m not sure if everyone else enjoyed their meals because we were trying to have a good time and look past certain things. However, another negative was the delivery of the food. The dishes came out separately; three of us ordered steak and eggs medium well, but only two came out. Being a gentlemen, I allowed the two plates to be given to the ladies, but mine didn\\'t come out until they were almost done. I found that to be unacceptable.\\n\\n\\nLastly, as it was my friend\\'s birthday it\\'s typical to do a little something for the birthday person. As I\\'m settling the bill I noticed a group inside being serenaded, so to speak by the staff. I then ask--hey, can you guys sing for my friend?\" Because I went inside and inquired if that was something she would want, she obliged. However, the server says to me \"I asked her earlier if she wanted it, and said no\" with a slight attitude. They come out, and they do their thing, but it was quick and half-hearted.\\n\\nAll and all, decent place, but that\\'s two negative experiences I\\'ve had here. Maybe I\\'ll just stick with their sister restaurant, Miti MIti instead.', u'Let me start off by saying that Bogota is a true gem! Its so beautifully decorated and the paintings are awesome. This place is vibrant, you feel the cuban vibes as soon as you walk in. \\n\\nThey have an extensive menu. My family and i ordered a bunch of appetizers and each item was so flavorful and authentic. I do recommend the stuffed sweet plantains. They also have a great drink menu. We started off with a pitcher of white sangria for our first round and i have to admit, since i am a huge wino & lover of sangria, this place is prob one of the best places for white sangria. For our second pitcher,  we opted for the red berry sangria which tasted like fruit punch. It was also good but i do prefer the white over red. For dessert we got the dessert sample and here is where my soul was sold!!! My god, their tres leches is amazinggg, their churros also amazing and they give you this yummy caramel sauce. So very pleased with the food & drinks.\\n\\nOur waiter was very attentive. Service was great. We were quickly seated. Got our orders correct and always checked in. \\n\\nPlease please if you are ever in the park slope area, I encourage you to stop by and try this gem. \\n\\n10/10 food\\n10/10 drinks\\n10/10 service', u'Praises to the chef and the bartender! Bogota did not disappoint in any way. The staff was friendly and attentive. I think I am a pretty good judge when it comes to Spanish food and I enjoyed every bit of my arroz con pollo, coconut shrimp and fried cheesecake. The drinks were pretty heavy on the fruit additions which took away valuable real estate that could have been reserved for more liquor but it was still effective and delicious. \\n\\nThe kitchen downstairs must be a well oiled machine because my food came out quick and the presentation was cute and fun. This is good for girls night, date night or fun with a group. The bar area is a little tight, grabbing a table is better and the energy from other patrons is electric.', u'food isnt anything to die for but all their drinks are 5 star...Nice decor and a good place to take a date...\\n\\nOther than that, this place is super expensive for what its worth.', u\"This started off as a 5 star review because the food is really excellent, but lost stars because of a safety issue and a water leak issue. \\n\\nPictures of the meals at this restaurant online drew us here while we were in town. We love all things ethnic and especially Latin cuisine. \\n\\nIt was busy but our party of five had only a brief wait. We were seated on the indoor patio. Part way through our dinner, hubby and I realized there's only one way of egress from this seating area - a fire hazard. \\n\\nAround the time that our appetizers came we noticed a water leak coming from the corner of the ceiling by the adjacent table. The ladies that were sitting there asked to be moved. I then noticed that the floor under their table was covered in water!\\n\\nThe food and service, however, did not disappoint! I shared an entr\\xe9e of chicken, rice and pinto beans, and a side of tostones, and my hubby had a to-die-for skirt steak with black beans. \\n\\nOur server was very attentive and friendly. \\n\\nSurprisingly, when we got our check I also received an in-house survey. I mentioned the water leak and the one-exit situation. It was mentioned by the server, after she saw how much I wrote, that she was glad I said something because they've been telling management they need to get the water leak fixed and their complaints have gone unheeded.\", u\"They have SOME amazing frozen sangrias (sangritas) here!! I would say one of the best I've tried! \\nThe decor is really cute & the spot looks small once you walk in but there is a decent sitting space towards the back! \\n\\nTheir steak & chicken empanadas were good as well! But my main dish tasted pretty mediocre. I really wanted to love their rotisserie Garlic chicken :(. But It was just OK! nothing id consider getting again to be honest! If I do come back here I'd try the bandera paisa or the pastelon which looked good! Our server Juan was amazing, all smiles and good service!\", u'Delicious food with extensive variety of choices. This restaurant is also vegetarian friendly. Waiter was accommodating, refilling our complimentary plantain chips. Bogota got me hook on to the miti miti green aji and red sauce. \\n\\n My Order : \\n1. Empanada sampler; choice of four empanadas I got their steak, chicken, and domino. They were very filling, not oily and delicious. \\n\\n2. Sancocho soup- it was good but was missing some seasonings but still delicious.\\n\\n3. Rotisserie chicken - juicy, garlicky chicken \\n\\n4. Bandeja paisa  - great portion of meat and sides this can definitely feed two people. \\n\\nDefinitely be coming back to try their other things on their menu.', u\"I came to Bogota because everything else in the area was overflowing with patrons and/or not a sauna. And what a find Bogota was!!!!\\n\\nNamed after the capital in the country of Colombia, Bogota is a fun, sleek, adventurous, and smart place to visit! Yes, smart! Upon entering, you will think that it's quite small - once you go past the bar, the entire restaurant opens up with this expansive space with a back area and a downstairs as well! We opted to sit at the bar, have some fabulous red wine based sangria, and guacamole. Both were on point, both were worthy of 3.8-4 Yelps, and the service from the bartenders were efficient and friendly.\\n\\nI've bookmarked it as a great spot to visit when every other bar is packed like a sardine can in the area...\\n\\nTHIS has been a review by Gaurav\", u\"Fun place for a (huge) meal! \\n\\nHad dinner last night for the first time and can confirm the stay-cay vibes that others have mentioned - Christmas lights and frozen drinks always make it a party, don't they? \\n\\nOur server Ryan was an absolute delight - friendly and knowledgeable and prompt, and totally steered us in the right direction by recommending that guava empanada. \\n\\nThe food was great - huge portions and very tasty all. \\n\\nPerhaps spent more than I would like to? But the empanadas could have been a meal in and of themselves if I was trying to scrimp, and happy hour (til 7pm) was good for the drinks!\", u\"This space is physically stunning - both inside and out back - and the food hits equally high notes. \\n\\nYou'll probably find it hard to believe how much seating exists inside what looks deceptively like a hole in the wall from the street.\\n\\nCan't go wrong with anything prepared with any of their house sauces.\", u\"I only had a light bite, so that's why I'm giving it three stars. But I definitely wanna come back here again.\\nI arrived to a que, which had me panicking at the first second but then made me think WOW this place must be really good if there's a wait! Lol.\\nI gave my name and was told there would be an approximate wait time of 20 minutes for party of two. In reality it was more like 5 minutes if even that.\\nStaff up front was Uber friendly.\\nService was really good. A full bowl of fried plantain chips was brought to the table, with a small condiment cup that he filled with the Aji dipping sauce that was already on the table.\\nWaiter Juan knew his stuff, was clear and sweet. He even repeated the spiel for my friend who arrived 20 minutes after me and made recommendations. Water was refilled without asking.\\nI got a Domino empenada which was delicious. My friend got a veggie empenada also delicious. Their individual dipping sauces was perfectly paired.\\nShe also got one of the corn bread thingies with cheese on top. I normally don't like cornbread/meal but this one was surprisingly not dry and perfectly flavored. I didn't care for the cheese but maybe next time I'll add guac to the cheese. I found it a bit over the top that they charged $4 for the cheese.\\nWe sat in the tent like area, and I love tents/outdoors so personal plus for me.\\nThey have two unisex bathrooms one of which has a baby changing station (+!) I used that one and I was super impressed that there was no urine smell and extra toilet paper rolls.\\nI am definitely coming back.\", u'I have been to this place countless of times. I am now finally writing my review. The food and drinks are awesome. Customer service is good but in rare cases it could be off. It may be due to a new waiter or waitress but all in all it is a great restaurant.', u\"I love Bogota! I've come here countless times and each experience has been better than the last. The paella and the garlic chicken are amazing and the drinks are perfect. If that weren't enough, the restaurant has a fun vibe with great decor  and music. Definitely worth checking out!\", u\"Came here because we were close by and starving. I am so happy we stopped in because I left so full and happy!\\n\\nI got Arroz con pollo which was excellent. My friend got the roasted chicken and was in heaven. She also enjoyed her flavored mojito, so much she had three! lol\\n\\nI ordered their coconut martini, which i found to be way too sweet. I think its my fault for ordering something I don't usually. I told my server, and I was able to switch the drink for another. This is really appreciated because they made the drink correctly, i just did not like it. I've had the worst time in New York if my order isn't right, so most of the time I wont even say anything if i just dont like it. \\n\\nI ordered one of their sangrias after and it was great. They had some happy hour deals, which it looks like they always have a drink special. Who doesnt love a drink special?!\", u\"If I could do a three and a half stars, I would. Here is what I liked: tasty well-priced drinks and the empanadas. Here's what I didn't: the noise level and the service, which was friendly but neglectful: we went for long periods without anyone coming to see if we needed another beverage and for the check. The food was mixed- one of us had the ribs and loved them, one had the garlic shrimp and enjoyed, and I had the pernil, which I found tasteless. The plantains were very tasty but the cilantro mashed potatoes were a bit gluey. I think I'll stick to Colombia in Park Slope, even though their drinks and empanadas are not nearly as good. Or maybe I just need to come to Bogota only for drinks and empanadas.\"], u'131.Walter\\u2019s': [u\"Distance only made my heart grow fonder! \\n\\nWe still live relatively close to here (about a 15-20 min walk) but we used to live a block away. Soooo, now that we can't just pop in whenever, I find myself actively MISSING Walter's a lot. \\n\\nEspecially the chicken and waffles. Ohhhh, the chicken and waffles. Please hurry over and get their chicken and waffles, available for brunch on the weekends. The chicken here is so crispy, so juicy, so delicious. Even the white meat is juicy, which is impressive (each order comes with one piece of dark and white meat). If you can't make it for brunch, they do serve the fried chicken as an entree for either lunch or dinner. The waffles here are really yummy as well - they aren't exactly super crispy but are a little more on the cakey side. This makes the waffles PERFECT for holding the maple syrup and hot sauce. By the way, Walter's serves the chicken and waffles with an apple cider butter and a side of tangy hot sauce. Pro-tip: ask them for their other housemade hot sauce as well - it's smokey and more mild but a nice addition to the other flavors.\\n\\nThe most recent time we went, we had Bloody Marys with extra olives, which were very tasty. There was a nice heat to the Bloody Mary that I appreciated. Their (I believe housemade) mix is SO flavorful and not watery at all. I really enjoyed it.\\n\\nFor brunch, you may end up waiting up to 45min or maybe even more - it gets PACKED cus it's awesome. It's totally worth it though! So, I say do it!\", u'I\\'m a super sucker for an old school New York style restaurant. Leave it to Brooklyn to deliver this small, quaint, really good gem of a diner. \\n\\nWalking into Walter\\'s is like walking into Dempsey\\'s in the 1940\\'s (I\\'m not that old but scenes from Godfather Part 1 look like Walter\\'s san the neon signs):  Bar in front, tables lining the windows with booths in the back. Wow, I love this stuff!\\n\\nThe menu is \"Comfort Food\" central. Fried chicken, Steak and frits, Caesar salad, stuffed Deviled eggs, French dip sandwich, hot Chicken wings and so much more. BTW we had all of the above and it was all excellent. The bar is generous, the prices are reasonable, the service is friendly and the ambiance is ridiculously good (see above).\\n\\nI loved coming to Walter\\'s. It made my first night in New York, really feel like my first night in New York.\\n\\nBRAVO Girls and Guys!!!!', u\"My go-to spot. Some faves: burger, caesar, octopus starter, whatevers clever. Brunch can be a long wait if you go after 12pm on the weekends but coffee nearby and the park helps kill time especially if the Farmer's Market is going on...\\n\\nBloody Mary is a must too!\", u\"Came by for drinks and some oysters, so that's all I am basing this review on. \\n\\nHad a lion stout. They give you a can and a cup. Thought they would be draft beers. My friend had the cucumber honey lemonade with a shot of gin, and that was really good. \\n\\nAlso had 5 oysters. When it comes out, the waiter tells you which order to eat it in. It comes with a lemon wedge and an assortment of pickles onions and cocktail sauce. They go well with the oysters. The oysters are fresh and meaty and delicious. \\n\\nPeople around me seemed to be enjoying their food and would come back to try their entree items. However, I noticed that the menu is $$$ so don't come here if you're on a budget.\", u'We went here for brunch. The wait was a half hour. It was fine because we checked out the farmers market while we waited. The chicken and waffles were incredible because they have spices in the butter with cinnamon and sugar and other warm spices. We also had eggs Benedict which was good too. I would also recommend the ginger honey soda if you need a non alcoholic drink.', u\"This place is really good Brooklyn definitely has a specific vibe and I would day that this place fit it quite a bit. One thing I notice is that people were making a lot of eye contact with me and it felt like in a good way different from Boston (which is were I live lol i don't know for the people who just follow randomly and don't know me if you even knew that). I had the chicken and waffles and it was very good and I had a cappuccino and it doent take much to impress me as far as those go so it was good to. Our waitress was nice and so was the guy who took my syrup (asked if he could). Definitely this place would be good for breakfast can't speak to other meals. It was fun to catch up with my friends\", u\"I've been meaning to visit Walter's for a while. But there's always a line out the door for dinner, and they're really popular for brunch.\\n\\nMy getting to Walter's was actually the result of a bit of happenstance. I was up at an ungodly hour due to hot wing eating contest-induced heartburn (long story), and found out that my friend also had problems sleeping. So we made plans for brunch at 9:45am (though I guess that's bordering on breakfast). The place we originally wanted to go to was closed for renovations, so I gave Walter's a call, found out there was no wait, and that's how we ended up having a great meal.\\n\\nWe got a table by the door and ordered some much-needed coffee (they get theirs from Oslo, so pretty damn good). I decided 10am was a little too early for alcohol. What have I become?\\n\\nOddly enough, I actually have been to their sister restaurant Walter Foods in Williamsburg before, but never to this location, which is walking distance from my apartment. I enjoyd my meal there as well.\\n\\nLuckily, their famed chicken and waffles are available at both locations. I convinced my friend to order the chicken and waffles.\\n\\nI ordered their smoked salmon eggs Benedict, and we split the two.\\n\\nThe waffle was super fluffy, and the chicken was crispy, juicy, and everything you want from your fried chicken.\\n\\nThe smoked salmon was also really good. Served on an English muffin and over a bed of hash browns, which was delicious. Super runny poached eggs completed the package.\\n\\nSo. Good.\\n\\nService was great. Food was excellent.\\n\\nI'm glad I finally made it to Walter's!\\n\\nReview #2300!\", u'Recommended by friend to come to this restaurant, service was great and people were very friendly!! I had the roasted half chicken, smashed potato was GREAT, and the chicken tasted really good.. love it! BTW, the octopus was fresh and they just cooked right and very good!', u'Walter\\'s\\nNY BK Fort Greene\\n12pm Saturday 11th February 2017\\nThree Stars\\n\\nSaturday Brunch with friends started with a 45 minute wait for a booth with a crooked table. The service was overall good. Two servers brought out our 4 coffees at the same time. The food was okay. I had the Eggs Benedict. The English muffin was a bit soggy, the poached eggs were perfect, the hollandaise was barely holding together, and the large grilled ham steak was tasty. The \"hash browns\" were closer to mashed potatoes or pur\\xe9ed home fries. It had no browning and no crispiness. The price was reasonable but wasn\\'t worth the wait.', u\"This place is a local staple. The menu has plenty of snacks and very suitable meals. The cocktails are inventive yet known to all. It's a great space. Try to get Kevin at the bar. His service is superior. Till next time...\", u'This place is so on-point! What a great find!\\n\\nDropped in here with my gal after seeing a show at the nearby Irondale Theater a few nights ago.\\n\\nFood, music, service, ambiance. Just right. Nice spot for a tasty dinner and the kitchen was open late so we scooted into a booth to feast.\\n\\nFried chicken, grilled salmon, cauliflower side, and a complimentary slice of key lime pie for dessert.\\n\\nPerfect late night dinner. Heaven.', u'I had only come in for brunch previously but went here for dinner last night and sat at the bar with a girlfriend. Brunch has always been consistently fantastic (paired of course with a wait to get in). \\n\\nBut last night I was pretty blown away with the French Dip. Holy shit. It was so good. Like for reals. So.Fucking.Good. And it came with shoestring fries. The asparagus we ordered on the side was also pretty perfect.\\n\\nThe service has always been good here. Femi was our bartender last night. He was friendly, had strong conviction we made the right choice with the french dip, and went above and beyond. Truly exceptional service. Thanks Femi!\\n\\nI will keep coming back for ALL the reasons. I need more of that French dip in my life. No joke.', u\"This is the type of place I don't want to tell people about. Like, I want it all to myself and the other 50 people who feel the same way about it but, sure, I guess that isn't a sustainable business practice.\\n\\nI came with a couple friends for a light dinner and drinks after hearing about this place through the grapevine. We ordered the artichoke dip, baby back ribs, brussels sprouts and spicy deviled eggs. Every single dish blew me away. The brussels sprouts were cooked in duck fat and rosemary with just the right amount of crisp, and just the right amount of kick to them. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone-type, covered with just enough sauce, and garnished with thinly sliced vegetables (think carrots/purple cabbage) that added a really nice crunch to each bite. The artichoke dip was delicious. Creamy, EXTRA cheesy and paired with crisp, buttery bread chips. Also, it was a really large serving. Even for three people it was a lot to eat. Lastly, the deviled eggs. Our waitress told us she was a huge deviled egg fan and these were her absolute favorite. We trusted her, because we felt like she wasn't like every other waiter out there, just recommending all the menu items since they work there, so we got some (one order includes two halves). They were *really* good. Really creamy, smooth texture, garnished with a vegetable slice (I don't think they need this) and dill (the dill really added something extra here).\\n\\nThis place is a cocktail place, and I really recommend at least trying one while you're here. Ask the waiter/waitress for suggestions if you're not sure what you'd like. Ours let my friend try the campari bitter since she wasn't sure about it, and she also helped us narrow in on options based on our tastes. I got the Bramble (gin, blackberries, lemonade), and my friends had the Diablo (tequila, honey, lime) and the Bitter Margarita (tequila, campari, lime). Mine was good, but I wasn't a big fan of the seeds getting sucked into my straw... I should've known better, but I just wanted to try something new. Either way, it was a good mix of flavors and you could tell they put a lot of care into making each drink.\\n\\nThe service was exceptional. Our waitress was quite possibly the best waitress I've ever had, and I hope I get her every time I come back.\\n\\nCan't recommend this place enough.\", u'The place had a great brunch food and also good drinks selection. I found my favorite cider here. The waffle had corn break like texture which I love and the fried chicken was done well. Food is definitely great.', u\"Perfect if you're looking for a very simple breakfast spot. I had a party of 3 and was seated immediately on a Sunday AM at 945AM.\\nI had the Walter's Breakfast with bacon and eggs over easy. Bacon was chewy and the hash browns were nice and crisp! \\nThe atmosphere was quiet and calm. Lots of natural lighting from outside. \\nOverall a nice and simple breakfast spot in Fort Greene.\", u'Dined here for brunch. We ordered the chicken and waffles and veggie breakfast sandwich with a side of sausage on a bagel and hash browns.   We were greeted and served right away and our food & drink orders arrived promptly.  The chicken was excellent fall off the bone crispy and not overly greasy.  The brine they use really tenderized the chicken. Our waffle portion was equally as good the batter was flavorful and the texture of the waffle was light and airy. The breakfast sandwich had a generous amount of avocado and sprouts but the bagel used was well past its freshness date. Hash browns reminded me more of smashed potatoes than hash browns but they were tasty. Next time I would order it on a brioche instead.  Service was excellent and our mimosas were nice and bubbly. Would not hesitate to recommend or return.', u\"Came here for brunch on a Saturday, around 1130am with my bf. Restaurant was busy but we got seated immediately. There was a group of 4 in front of us who had to wait though. \\n\\nFood is good here. We ordered the chicken waffles and the salmon benedict. The chicken was warm and tender with a nice fried crunchy coating. The waffles were warm soft and fuffy. Bf said it's probably one of the better waffles he's had on a chicken waffle dish (and we've tried many, since I'm a chicken waffles freak). The salmon benedict was tasty too. Good flavors, although my egg wasn't as runny as I would've liked. \\n\\nWe ordered the cucumber Mint lemonade and the pomegranate lemonade. They were so sour...in particularly the promegranate. I did not enjoy them at all.\", u\"Went here on Saturday jul,8,for brunch on my boyfriends birthday we both had egg Benedict with hash potatoes and salad,I had the smoke salmon,he had the steak ham,I must say it was the best egg Benedict I ever had,I must say i was very happy with this place and their deli ious food,every time we drive past this place it's always people waiting,we had prepared ourselves for a long wait but we went later on in the day,so we got seated right away,the waiter was so attentive and nice,small place,but I loved the atmosphere,I would definitely go again\", u'Amazing food, adorable corner spot, great people!  Awesome brunch!', u\"When I moved to Brooklyn, I started to frequent Walter's for brunch.\\n\\nYou can count on it being PACKED. Clearly a testament to the quality! We grabbed two seats at the bar, which are first come first serve. If you are going with more than one other person, I would count on a little wait time, but the food is worth it. We usually always find ourselves at the bar.\\n\\nI had the spinach benedict- so good! LOVE the hollandaise and potatoes. My friend had the breakfast sandwich with goat cheese, egg, and avocado on brioche. Also delicious!\\n\\nI ordered a virgin Bloody Mary, and I wouldn't suggest it. It tasted like just hot sauce, no real tomato flavor at all. I can't imagine vodka would have made it any better.\\n\\nThe prices are fairly good as well if you aren't drinking alcohol.\"], u'87.Sakana Sushi & Asian Bistro': [u'Takeout Review:\\nSo in love with their shrimp tempura burrito! I was hesitant but it sooooo hit the spot. The crab Rangoon was better than the typical Chinese fare and the sauce it comes with compliments it very well.  \\n\\nShrimp tempura roll is described incorrectly online and that was my only qualm. I was interested to see it with eel on top as described but it was deliivered as the typical shrimp tempura roll. \\n\\nDelivery was quick and the delivery guy was very nice.\\n\\nCurrent Mood: Pleasesently stuffed', u\"Was super impressed with my sushi lunch special. Fish was top nosh--unexpectedly fresh and generously cut. Our server told us that the owner's philosophy is to invest in quality and value of the product instead of advertising. That's a real boon to the customer that knows about the place. But it also means they rely a bit on word of mouth. I hope they stick around as they're a great addition. \\n\\nThe lunch specials come with miso soup or salad, as is standard. The soup was just fine, but I was especially impressed with the salad as it was large and fresh, and the last place I got a sushi starter salad it was small and soggy.\\n\\nThey post in the window a 10% dine-in special. I was betting they wouldn't give it when the bill\\ncame unless I asked for the discount. And I wouldn't have because the price was so low and value so good that I felt I was stealing from the place. But the 10% was automatically taken off. Can't wait to return as often as I can.\", u\"I had to treat a friend sushi bc I lost a bet and we wanted to try a new sushi place in Brooklyn. I literally typed in sushi in the search bar and location: Brooklyn, Sakana Sushi was amongst the first few. \\n\\nWhen my friend and I arrived, it was a little over an hour before closing time. We were seated promptly bc there was absolutely no one there besides us (I'd like to see service when it IS busy lol). We noticed the tissue and chopsticks right away since it was pre-placed on the table - looked really nice & an upper scale quality as it wasn't your typical napkin and wooden chopsticks. \\n\\nThe menu had a good selection like you'd see from any sushi restaurant. A little on the pricey side as a roll was about $4.50 but it was definitely worth it. The sushi tasted really good and nicely presented; the only problem was that the seaweed wasn't sticking well on my Alaskan roll but no biggy. \\n\\nMy friend and I didn't go to the restroom so we didn't get to see the rest of the store besides the front but looked clean from what we saw lol. The staff was really friendly to us and even gave us 10% off the bill, not sure if it was bc it was closing time? Definitely was a good experience here.\", u\"Great Sushi..great lunch special..sushi comes very fresh and full size. They don't forget to put spicy mayo for me and the delivery is super fast.\", u\"I have no idea how this place has 5 stars. My delivery was late. The rock shrimp arrived cold, soggy, flavorless (and it's NOT rock shrimp. It's regular shrimp.) The sushi is SWIMMING. SWIMMMMMMMING in mayonnaise. I had to throw it out. I gagged just looking at it. I waited so long and was so hungry and not only am I disappointed but I'm still so hungry and have no choice but to eat this disgusting shrimp.\", u\"Had a wonderful experience with my boyfriend on Friday night. The food was delicious and the service was really great! I'll definitely go back again :)\", u'Had such a great first time trying this restaurant. The food was cooked really well and beautifully presented and the staff was very friendly and attentive. I came here to try the veggie sushi donut that they had advertised outside to see what all of the hype was about, I kind of wish it was filled with something not just on top but was still very good. I will deff be coming back !', u'Food was delicious, service was perfect. I was hoping for more special rolls. Most of them have eel or use eel sauce. Everything here was very pretty from the napkin to the dishes and the food was presented nicely. \\n\\nKani Salad ($5.95)- 5/5 Really big portion! Not too much mayo, and enjoyed the sesame added to it. Probably one of the best kani salad I\\'ve ever had. \\n\\nCrab Rangoon ($6.95)- 5/5 Deep fried cream cheese with crab! This was so delicious, especially with the sauce that comes with it. \\n\\nYum Yum Roll Chef\\'s Special ($15.95)- 4/5 I love cream cheese in my sushi! It had tempura shrimp\\ninside and was topped with eel. They give you a lot of sauce so soy sauce wasn\\'t really needed. \\n\\nBlack Diamond Roll Chef\\'s Special ($14.95)- 3/5 This looked very similar to the Yum Yum Roll especially since they were both topped with eel. But didn\\'t taste much of the \"lobster salad.\"', u'Was surprised to find this place in Bay Ridge during the Summer Stroll. Was very quiet compared to the other restaurants on this busy night in Bay Ridge, which was nice for a change. We were pleasantly surprised with the many options that were on the menu! We all had a little bit of everything. I recommend the pork dumplings/gyoza - they were delicious! The beef pad thai I had for my entree was really good, although the beef was chewy so I would opt for the veggie pad thai next time instead. The wait staff was very attentive and kept our water glasses full. Also, this is possibly the cleanest Asian restaurant in Brooklyn! It was spotless, including the restroom.', u'I finally tried this place and It was beyond amazing. Not only they have an extensive menu;but the service, ambiance, portions and price are spot on. Its fusion and they have Japanese, Thai, Chinese and some Korean specialty dishes. We ordered the Japanese spring rolls, veggie gyoza, sesame chicken and the SAKANA love fest. All of the sauces were delish, generous white meat chicken portions and shrimp cooked to perfection. There is so much in their menu, got the menu, We are definitely going back.', u'Aha ,This is my first time come into Sakana with my friends \\nI ordered white Tiger Roll and Black Diamond .So great it was an amazing place chilling out ,Also the service always pay attention on time', u\"Was in the area shopping for a dress and was craving Japanese food, so me and my husband decided to try this place out since it had good ratings on yelp. \\n\\nThe decor was nice, and server was very attentive.\\n\\nWe had the Kani salad and Japanese spring rolls as appetizers. Both were pretty good.\\n\\nFor our entree, I had the new new burrito. While my husband had the salmon balsamic teriyaki. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to try the teriyaki. The burrito presentation was nice and it was really good. \\n\\nOverall, we were happy with our meal. I just wish this place was closer to where I lived, but I would definitely visit again. \\n\\nP.S. They have 10% off dine in only - which we didn't know about until our bill came, but that was a nice surprise.\", u\"I'm finally giving my long overdue review but what can I say my husband and I were too busy enjoying the delicious food. We have had delivery, pick up and sit down since they opened up. Sakana doesn't disappoint for sure. So far we had the WonTon soup definitely not your typical Chinese take out. Thinly wrapped pieces of dumplings (not that thick doughy wrapper) in a flavorful broth. We've had the Crab Rangoon, Japanese spring rolls, calamari, Asian Felt salad, assortment a of rolls and I could go on and on. Everything we had was fresh and had tons of flavor! So happy they're conveniently close by.\", u'The food here is so good! They bring their A-game every time! The service is also impeccable! The only thing is, I hope they get their liqueur license soon cuz I love having hot sake with sushi. Regardless I will be coming here often for their excellent soups, sushi and BBQ.', u\"Only had deliveries, 9 our of 10 they are quick to deliver, and most importantly - the food is AMAZING! So fresh and tastes so 'clean', i.e. not greasy at all, and is just so good! So far I've had the shrimp pad thai (they don't use the bigger king prawns - but still tasty), pork dumplings, shumai and yaki udon w chicken - all delicious! So happy with this place!\", u'AWESOME AND BEST PRICES! At first we thought this was the best sushi in BayRidge, but then seriously it is the best sushi at these prices in Manhattan and Brooklyn! Our favorite place either for delivery or dine in. Everyone is so friendly, food is fresh, beautiful, great menu options, and good portions on everything including the fish in sushi! Delicious, nothing but compliments and we will sorely miss you when we move!', u'Fresh material make the yummy food. We maked the order several times. They always provide the best food.', u\"this place is on the same level as Fushimi for me, except they don't have a liquor license, but u can BYOB.  I am very picky about food ,but this place has AMAZING food from sushi to thai soups and stuff..highly recommended if u like quality food and service! love and respect for hard work all the employees!\", u'Came here looking for good sushi and it was great! I got salmon sushi and sashimi and it was so fresh! Very fresh fish and the service was great. All servers were so polite. Very clean and reasonably priced. I will be back!', u'Came here on a Sunday evening. The aesthetic was real nice! Service was impeccable--our waitress was YoYo and she was not overbearing, but always checked in to make sure we were enjoying our food.  All of our food tasted so FRESH! We ordered the Thai Lemongrass seafood soup, Thai Curry Hot Pot, Bacon Miso Shrimp Fried Rice, and an Alaskan roll. No complaints. I will absolutely return here!'], u'105.Fette Sau': [u\"Fette Sau certainly makes the list for my top NEW YORK BBQ, which until recent times was a very low bar to reach. Falling directly behind Hometown BBQ (Red Hook) as my second favorite, Fette Sau certainly doesn't disappoint.  The space is very interesting, and overall a no frills establishment. \\n\\nI've always enjoyed their pulled pork, brisket, and especially their baked beans (somewhat spicy)!  Another cool aspect is that several businesses in the block are owned by the same individual; namely, Spuyten Duvel, and St. Anselm and are absolutely fantastic.\", u\"Since we usually park in Williamsburg to take the subway to the city, we always pass the infamous glowing pink sign on the was to the BQE. It was highly recommended by my friend and we had gone to a location just outside the city center of Philly, so we had high expectations. \\nI was dining here with my fianc\\xe9 on the way home from doing some errands in the city. Finding parking wasn't a huge issue as we found a spot down one of the side streets. This location is notably smaller than the one we have gone to in Philly. Ordering the food is done on the same way, ordering meat by the pound and then sides with drinks. I'm not entirely sure if it happened that we were in NY versus Philly but I did notice that the sides and drinks were more pricey. Sodas were $5 a pop, ouch. Mind as well get a whiskey shot which I saw on the board for $4. Between the two of us the bill was just over $74 for 1.5 lb brisket, German potato salad, burnt ends baked beans and two sodas. Seating was first come first seated. \\nThe brisket was definitely good, but I felt like it wasn't as fall apart and well seasoned as the Philly location. The huge disappointment was the burnt end baked beans. I was awful. We did it find any burnt ends in it and it tasted like a mouthful of their spicy bbq sauce with beans that lacked flavor. It was nothing like the ones at the Fette Sau in Philly that had a more normal sauce to the baked beans with clear chunks of the burnt ends from the brisket. \\nCompared to the Philly location There seemed to be less options of meats. The Philly location also had happy hour specials and a more friendlier and organized system. I also felt that they could of had a better selection of sides. Not sure if it just happened to be that day, but they were missing Mac n cheese which is a huge staple to bbq joints.\\nWould we ever go here again? For one thing, I would not go out of my way for it. So sticking to the Philly location hands down.\", u\"Good food and good atmosphere. One of the better BBQ spots in the city I've been to.\\n\\nThe bourbon and rye selection is a nice bonus!\", u'The quest for quality NYC BBQ led a group of us from Queens and various parts of Nassau County to make the trek to Brooklyn to (finally) check out this well-reviewed spot. Having previously lived in Texas, I\\'m no stranger to quality BBQ but I\\'ve had a difficult time finding one in the Greater NYC area that stacks up to those down South. Accordingly, I have always graded non-Southern BBQ on a different curve but have been longing to locate local places worthy of being graded on the same curve. After much searching, I can say that Fette Sau has come perhaps the closest to stacking up.\\n\\nAs when checking out any other establishment on Metropolitan Ave. in Williamsburg, parking was an adventure. As luck would have it, we located a spot within a short walk from the restaurant...even if it took like 15 turns to fit into the spot. Beware of this and maybe commute in or cab it over, depending on where you\\'re coming from.\\n\\nWhen you approach the address, you may not immediately see the restaurant. That\\'s because it\\'s recessed from the sidewalk and marked with a little black sign with pink neon lettering \"floating\" just overhead. Just as you enter the walkway up to the building, you will see a handful of simple picnic tables lining the wall to your left. When you reach the building, hang a sharp right then left to get to the entrance. When the garage door is open, you can always walk in that way as well, if you so choose.\\n\\nAs you approach, the strong smell of smoky BBQ fills your nostrils and immediately amplifies your appetite. As your get closer, you will notice the dark, simple seating area inside. Lighting is fairly dim. Music is loud. We opted to dine al fresco and grabbed a picnic table out front. That also enabled us to converse more easily with the music inside being as loud as it wa.\\n\\nWhile waiting for our entire party to arrive, we ponied up to the bar to pass the time. There is seating for just over a handful of people. The back wall of the bar is chock full of whiskeys to the left, about 10 taps of beer in the middle, and a variety of other spirits to the right. The layout is simple and the beer taps are actually cutlery. Slightly medieval looking but also cool.\\n\\nAs with many quality BBQ places, meats are served/priced by the lb. Most are between $25-29/lb. and a couple of items (including the chicken) are $23. Traditional sides are around $6-7. Being that this was our 1st time here, we decided to order several items to share and the server guided us on how best to do that. All totaled, we ordered a pound and a 1/2 of brisket, a pound of pork belly, at least a pound of ribs, a few sausage links, 2 orders each of the burnt end baked beans and German style potato salad. They also threw some rolls on top for good measure.\\n\\nAs for the food, everything we had was decent but I think the brisket was the clear winner for me. It was tender, moist, and flavorful. The other meats were okay but nothing that made me craving more. The sides were pretty good, esp. the beans. Now this is where I have to compare Fette to the aforementioned Southern BBQ. While Fette is approaching that curve, in retrospect, I\\'d say it still falls a little short due to the overall quality of all the meats we tried. The brisket comes the closest to being competitive but even it could benefit from a little BBQ sauce. For me, when BBQ is \"that good\", no sauce needs to be added. My search continues but Fette is not a bad option up here.\\n\\nI\\'ll continue my quest by looking to check out Hometown BBQ (BK), Mighty Quinn\\'s (various), Butcher Bar (QNS), and Hill Country (NYC)...among others. Fette, I\\'m rounding my 3.5 stars up to 4 stars here and I\\'ll see you again though.', u'Mehhhhh. \\n\\nPros: \\n+ Sometimes, the food is REALLY on point and tasty. The brisket and ribs can be perfectly textured, a tender marbling of fat, meat, and crisp.\\n+ Love that they give you little slider buns. I stuff them with brisket and generous splashes of vinegary BBQ sauce. The folks who work the counter will happily give you more if you ask. \\n+ The variety of BBQ sauces here are great! They\\'ve got something for everyone. Sweet, vinegary, hot. Though I will say their hot sauce was pretty mild. \\n+ Fantastic sides. I love the broccoli salad and potato salad. They need to get some crispy fries in the mix. \\n\\nCons: \\n- The seating is first-come, first-serve... But there\\'s no signage to indicate that. And it doesn\\'t work, anyhow. Seriously, I\\'d rate this place a whole star and a half higher if they had table service. The last time we came here, there were two tables that had finished their food before we arrived, and 1.5 hrs later (when we were on our way out), they were STILL there. Meanwhile, just a few feet away were several folks waiting patiently for a table. Yes, what I\\'m saying is, this is the kind of place where you may have to ask multiple groups of strangers when they\\'ll be leaving. \\n- Tourist hell on Friday nights and weekends. Seriously, when did this place become the TGI Friday\\'s on Times Square? This in combination with the above bullet point creates the perfect storm. The last time we were there, a rowdy group of tourists kept smoking despite the obvious \"No Smoking\" signage. They were told 3 times by restaurant staff to stop smoking, but they would not stop. Pretty obnoxious and a total vibe-killer. \\n- It\\'s extremely loud inside. Okay, so for those who haven\\'t been here before, there\\'s an indoor area and an outdoor area. We pretty much only ever consider the outdoor area, since they blast music indoors so loud that you\\'d have to yell at the top of your lungs to have a conversation. \\n- Inconsistent quality. Sometimes the meat is just... off. Overcooked to the point of being tough to cut through, and just straight-up unappetizing. This leads me into my next point: \\n- SO expensive. It wouldn\\'t be if all the issues above got resolved (and in fact I might be fine paying more), but till then, the price doesn\\'t seem fair. (To give you an idea - 3 pork ribs cost $15. That\\'s $5 a rib!) \\n\\nMy recommendation: \\n1. Go on a weekday. Bring friends. \\n2. Once you get there, have one person stand on line, and another person scope out a table outside. \\n3. After you finish eating, don\\'t loiter too long if there are folks waiting for a seat. Be kind!', u\"I been feigning to check out Fette Sau and was disappointed with the lack of choices on the menu.... meats were ok, sides were eh... everything was mediocre at best and very overpriced. I'll stick to John Brown. The only thing that was delicious and would bring me back to Fette Sau would be that burnt end baked beans-- $7.50 for a small cup...\", u\"So... the BBQ is good (have high standards after returning from Memphis) however, it took an hour to stand in line for already cooked food. Was very confused about the slowness of the line... and I'm super patient! The brisket was moist and melted in my mouth, but I'm not sure I'd wait in line for an hour next time... \\n\\nIf you do go, order the baked beans. They were da bomb.\", u\"Absolute lovely place to stay. Chilled Ambiente and calm music. The food is good but nothing really outstanding. It's quite expensive aswell. For one person (w/o a drink) you are good to go with around 35\\u20ac to open end.\\nThe beers on the other side are a must taste. Well rounded pale ales and other delicious sorts. Check it out if you are around.\", u'It was a delicious adventure into the world of American BBQ! The brisket was amazing along with the beans. Loved the vibe, loved the food.', u\"If you are looking for some good quick BBQ food in Williamsburg Brooklyn then you should head to Fette Sau which is a great place for all meat lovers. If you have visited New York, you know that most people don't have backyards so doing BBQ isn't always the easiest thing. They offer everything from brisket to ribs, pork cheeks, German potato salad, sausage, baked beans and the oh so delicious bacon ends. The ambiance is great for a group of friends grabbing some quick food and a drink but make sure to arrive early as they sell out of meats quickly. They opened at 12 on a Sunday and I arrived at 12:30 and had to wait on about a twenty minute line that by the time I got up to the counter all the ribs were sold out; but I was still able to sample everything else.\\n\\nThis restaurant does not have waiter service but has counter service. You can order what you like and they place it on a tray and and you can take your food inside on a picnic bench, at the bar or outside.\\n\\nThe meats are all written on a chalk board right by the counter and they do rotate so you might not get what you came for. If you are coming for a particular meat you should try calling ahead.  You can order as little as you like so just tell them how much you want and what sides. Just remember that  1/2 LB of meat should be good for most of us. You can always go back for more. The meats can range between $20-$28 per pound and the sides are not included. We spent $78 for three people. No drinks included.\\n\\nI drove in on a Sunday and was able to find free street parking only a block away. If you are taking the subway it's a little walk from the L train. This is a great spot for a quick in and out meal. I am hoping to try some pork ribs next time I go!\", u'This spot is literally located in an alley-like hallway. They have seatings outside and inside. Kinda hard to find seatings, we came on a Saturday around dinnertime.\\n\\nPretty cool idea, line up, order ur meats and drinks. We got the briskets, pork belly, sausages and baby back ribs. Also got a side of broccoli and potatoes. Came with some buns.\\n\\nTable has napkins and 2 diff types of bbq sauces and 1 bottle of vinegar. I liked the more red colored bbq sauce, they werent labeled so dotn even know what theyre called.\\n\\nWe all honestly really only enjoyed the pork belly cos it was so tender (but also very fatty). I felt like the other meats were too dry. The ribs werent fall off the bone. And also noticed the meats werent warm when served.\\n\\nIve only been to two other bbq spots, Smoke Joint and Hill Country. Both were the better ones.\\n\\nIts a cool concept but meats needs to be warmer when served and more juicy/tender. Sauces can also be labeled so customers know which sauce is their fave.', u\"4.5 stars - the best bbq we've had in NYC.\\n\\nSUBWAY - it's a little walk from the L train, but it's near where my husband gets his hair cut so we went right after.\\n\\nWAIT - came on a snowy January Saturday at 12:15pm and there was NO wait.  Probably only 1 other group in the restaurant other than us. \\n\\nATMOSPHERE: Feels like a bar/bbq joint with communal tables (both inside and out) and it's a little hard to see from the outside because there is a small hanging sign, you have to walk in to get to the door.  It's dark, they play music and there's a beer/bar area to get drinks.  You order first then they give you your food right away.  I like that it has a display case of all the food.\\n\\nFOOD: Everything is sold by the pound, so you just tell them how much you want and what sides.\\n\\nBRISKET - 1/2 a pound was enough for 2 of us (probably 5-6 slices of brisket) it was pretty fatty, without the sauce it was SLIGHTLY flavorless but the ratio of fat to meat was good and it wasn't tough or dry at all.\\n\\nPORK RIBS - probably the best pork ribs i've had.  they always tend to be dry or hard or stringy but they were soft, literally fell off the bone, fatty and tasty/juicy.  Very good flavor, didnt need any sauce at all.  We got 4 ribs which amounted to about a pound.\\n\\nBROCCOLI - good side to help cut through the grease, it's a little spicy and on the pickled side - so it tastes like the pickled broccoli ban chan at korean restaurants. there is a lot.\\n\\nBURNT ENDS BAKED BEANS - so flavorful, the baked beans almost had a chili like taste to them and the burnt ends added some meat.  very delicious.\\n\\nBACON ENDS - also very good, a little on the salty side but tasted like thick cuts of bacon with lots of fat. highly recommended. 1/4 pound was like 5-6 pieces of bacon.\\n\\nOverall, very impressed and would recommend this.  The plate comes with free bread and sauces on the table.  I didnt try any of the sauces because they have beer in them (I'm trying to be gluten free) but my husband said they tasted good.\", u'The line can be packed at times. However by the time you get to place your order and get your food someone has finished eating and their is seating available. Be REALLY kind to the people ordering your food! I say this because a lot of people are rude and don\\'t say \"hello\" or acknowledge the servers. The same people seem to over order because they don\\'t know jack about food weight and pricing. (all you had to do was say hello and ask) GREAT FLAVORS.', u\"Felt like I had to update my review out of obligation to my fellow yelpers. I came here a while back and thought that it deserved 4 star status. Went today and was just completely disappointed. In fact the food was just downright bad. The brisket was ridiculously dry. The ribs were just okay, no real flavor. The pork belly was where I drew the line. When served to me I noticed that the pork belly was pure fat. I couldn't believe that they even placed it on my tray. I then told the staff and they replied with well,  it's an animal. I understand that,  but who eats straight fat. Pork belly is fat in nature. That is understood. That makes it really tasty, but there should be some meat beneath the fat. For example, I order ribeye expecting fat, but don't expect to be served a piece of steak that features just the chewy white goop that makes up fat.  I'm not trying to compare ribeye and pork, but no one just orders straight fat regardless of the animal from which it is obtained. Then they somewhat acknowledge my point and say, well we got to sell it. WOW! So they basically are saying that they're pushing bad meat no matter what it comes out looking like. In the restaurant business, sometimes you must discard a bad product. You don't just give it to the customer in hopes that it doesn't get sent back. I realize that this is far from a Michelin restaurant but regardless. Based on the responses that I received tonight, I concluded that there was this huge disregard for their customers.  Each selection of meat proved to be  poor quality and was unremarkable. I couldn't help but think that  perhaps to cut cost they began slumming. Umm here's a thought, you are running a meat show, find a good butcher man! I left feeling really bad like my stomach was unhappy with what I put into it. Will not be back.\", u\"Pricey, but delicious. Had the brisket and ribs. Broccoli was alright-it paired well with the food though. Beans were the best I've ever had-probably because there was beef AND pork in it!\\n\\nEmployees were extremely helpful in deciding portions so don't be afraid to ask questions.\", u\"6pm on a Friday night was the calm before the storm; shortly after and the line was out the door.  Staff is friendly and helpful, but this isn't a sit down type of place: you order your meats and take to an open space you find.\\n\\nWe ordered the brisket, chicken, St Louis ribs, broc salad, and pickles.  All the meats had great smoky flavor and dry rub.  We thought the chicken and ribs were very tasty, but the brisket fell a bit short in preparedness (a bit dry and not as much flavor as the others).  Sides were tasty - clean flavors all around.\\n\\nMeal is pricey, but NYC bbq can run a bit high.  \\n\\nOverall not my favorite bbq spot in BK - I'd rather go down to the one in Red Hook if the hankering called.  Although you won't go wrong if you need the meats in a pinch with Fette Sau.\", u\"Yummy. Got there and the line wasn't too bad, but it's still quite a wait because it's one person cutting the meat, one preparing the sides, and one manning the cashier. Got 1 lb brisket, 1 lb of pork ribs, and 1/2 lb of pulled pork. We got baked beans, potato salad, and pickles. The food was legit. Brisket was extra moist, ribs were smoky and flavorful, and the pulled pork wasn't too dry. The sauce is killer. I like the basic bbq, not a fan of the others. We had enough for four people. Will definitely return. Nice selection of drinks too.\", u\"Best brisket in Brooklyn! \\nThe people who work there are helpful on portion size and what to order for how many people are dining\\nI didn't love the ribs or the sides but the brisket more than makes up for it!\\nLove\", u\"Been here a few times now. Fette Sau is extremely consistent and tasty.\\n\\nThe barbecue is top quality and the side offerings are versatile yet equally delicious. For example, when I went last week (8/27/2017) my friend ordered the broccoli and I ordered the baked beans with chunks of bacon :). While at two ends of the culinary spectrum (bacon beans vs. mini trees), I loved them both! \\n\\nMeats can change... upon my most recent visit the restaurant offered a pastrami brisket which, to be honest, I wasn't a huge fan of. That said, While I was impressed by the extra effort required to produce a pastrami brisket, I was craving the classic stuff!\\n\\nPulled pork is good, pork belly is good, and the Peking duck was GREAT.\\n\\nMy biggest gripe with Fette Sau is that the place is a bit pricey for what you buy AND the service----while extremely friendly--- can be SLOW. \\n\\nOverall, if you're visiting my neck of the woods, Williamsburg, you'd be remiss to not check out Fette Sau!\", u'While the bbq was tasty, I thought it was rather pricey & the side options were few...good choices for tap beer...not a place for the health conscious!'], u'35.Gnarly Eats': [u\"Review based solely on delivery: \\n\\nI order from here frequently through Amazon Restaurants. We've ordered the classic burger, buttermilk fried chicken burger, mac and cheese jalapeno poppers, beef brisket, sweet potato fries, and the mighty wings. \\n\\nThe classic burger and the fried chicken burger are my favorites. Although it's wasteful, they deconstruct and package every part of the burger separately. It makes a huge difference! Note, they attach a label that says their food is even better when it's not delivered. The mac and cheese jalapeno poppers and the beef brisket aren't my favorite. Although, both are good options, I prefer their burgers. I wish the jalapeno poppers had a bit of a kick; they're extremely mild. The beef brisket is okay, but very messy. The sweet potato fries are awesome! Although I've never had the mighty wings, my boyfriend prefers them over everything else. \\n\\nFor nights when I don't feel like cooking, Gnarly Eats pulls through. Everything tastes homemade and fresh without being soggy, like most delivered food. The quality has been consistent, so we'll continue to get our delivery burger fix through them.\", u\"Adorable little hole in the wall that if you blinked you'd miss it. They can only fit a handful a people at a time, but thankfully there was no one here when I stopped by this past Sunday afternoon. Seemed everyone opted for delivery and I have to say if you live in the neighborhood that's probably the better bet for guaranteed seating.\\n\\nBased on the Yelp pics I'd originally came for their famed Gnarly burger but changed my mind to the Buttermilk Fried Chicken sandwich and some sort of loaded pulled pork fries. The chicken sandwich was to die for, the chicken was cooked just right and well seasoned topped with delicious coleslaw and house sauce. Hands down one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I've ever had. The loaded fries were decent but the pulled pork was on the dry side and it had bacon that didn't really taste like bacon it was strange. \\n\\nWashed it all down with some amazing house made lemonade. I had strawberry basil and my friend the prickly pear. Both were yummy with just the right balance of sweet and tart. To top it all off the lady behind the counter was super nice and attentive continually checking on us to make sure everything went well. Would definitely venture back out here again to indulge.\", u'DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE\\nPlate Presentation was pretty amazing. OTHERWISE, nothing else was enjoyable. We ordered the \"The Grateful Dead\" signature Burger which was...\\nSLOPPY - literally fell apart and was all over the table and partially down my legs.\\nFLAVORLESS - Where did you get this MEAT? The 99cent store? (NO SEASONING!!!!) Plus the bun WAY too small.\\nCHEESE (was this from the Government?) soooo CHEAP it didn\\'t even MELT!\\nAlso ordered the Milkshake which was literally just ice cream in a small cup for $6', u'Hmm... i am conflicted. The sandwich was definitely good but they have a bizarre way of packaging take-out. They package everything separately so you have to essentially make the sandwich yourself.\\n\\nThe reason is because people probably have complained that the bread gets soggy if it is in the plastic wrap.\\n\\nWord of advice: do your thing gnarly eats. People will either love it or hate it. Either way they will find a flaw in something if they are looking for one.\\n\\nOverall, the sandwiches were good. The fried chicken was a little bready (too much coating). The brisket was ok but i didnt get the full experience bc i had to make the sandwich myself.\\n\\nThis might have been a 3.5 but i gave the benefit of the doubt to the place since they care enough about the customer that they do take out like that.', u\"I wrote a one star review a few months back as I felt I was treated poorly at gnarly eats. The owner kindly wrote back to me asking me to come give it another shot, so I did.\\nI went in as a regular customer and didn't let the owner know that it was me because I wanted to pay for my food rather than have it on the house.\\n\\nI must say, I have changed my mind. The owner and his wife were working the day i went back. They were both super kind and he was talking to me about how his vision for the restaurant came to life, without knowing it was me who wrote the bad review.\\n\\nThe food was very good. I ordered the chicken sandwich again and the loaded sink fries with the pear lemonade. Everything was so good, and I was happily stuffed afterwards. Ever since I've order four or five times. I'm happy I gave gnarly eats another shot. \\n\\nJust to be clear the first time the food was very good. The review was only due to customer service*\", u'Coldplay burger is awesome, very good beef. The place is very small, 4 chairs inside, 4 chairs outside, plus some places at the bar. But cosy. And the Tardis door!', u\"This is a tiny place with seating for, maybe 10. The server was super sweet, polite and the whole ambiance of the place is lovely. Everything you want a hole-in-the-wall place to be.\\n\\nI ordered the Gnarly burger, in hindsight I should of gone for the highly recommended fried Chicken burger instead.\\n\\nThe burger was sufficiently sized with a leaky fried egg on top. I was a bit disappointed with the taste of the thing. It felt slightly lacking in flavor, I'm not sure how to put my finger on it. Maybe it was just lacking in salt, but everything felt a bit underwhelming. I would want to go back and try them again, but this experience was neither here nor there.\", u\"This little hole in the wall is a gem! Food is priced great and the food was delicious. I ordered the buttermilk chicken sandwich and the brisket slider and both we're very flavorful!\", u\"I had the The BUTTERMILK CHICKEN BURGER (spicy)\\nButtermilk Fry chicken marinated in buttermilk with herbs and spices, homemade pickled cabbage, coleslaw with homemade spicy mayo and house sauce on it salt Gary potato bun. (Thigh Meat)!  \\n\\nThis sandwich is the BEST CHICKEN SANDWICH THAT I HAVE HAD IN A LONG TIME!\\n\\nI'm in heaven!    I love the plates!   I LOVE THE FOOD!   I will be back!\", u'Ordered from here through seamless and found a dead fly in my food. Will never order from this place ever again.', u\"I'd give them five stars solely for their buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. It was TOO good! \\n\\nThe place is small, but they do have seats for about 10 people. They started out as a rolled ice cream place, and they expanded their hot menu as if got colder out. They do plan on bringing the rolled ice cream back when it gets warmer though! I'll definitely be back for that. \\n\\nAs I said, the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich is a must. The classic burger was solid, and I love that they came on potato buns. It just made everything taste so classic. The double fried wings were also a solid appetizer, just know that these take a big longer to make. They also have shakes!\", u\"The buttermilk fried chicken sandwich is certainly the BEST fried chicken sandwich I've had to this date. Seriously it was immaculate. The most important part (the chicken, duh...) was juicy and seasoned really well. The red cabbage/slaw were great complements, but the spicy mayo sauce stole the show. Shoot the potato bun was tasty too. The sandwich became sloppy after a while but this didn't bother me one bit. I asked for a spoon to sop up all the goodness that fell on the tray.\\n\\nThe space was small but cute and inviting. I found the sign suggesting patrons eat the food to stay amusing. Moreover, the young lady at the front was pleasant and provided stellar service. I'm a fan and cant wait to try other items.\", u\"Check in for a free prickly pear lemonade--you won't regret it! So good! Went with two friends, between us we ordered the Gnarly Eats burger, Buttermilk Fried Chicken burger and the Classic burger. We also got the Loaded Sink Fries. Milk shakes were delicious!\", u'Ordered for delivery, a burger and tots. Both were great! A really good burger and the way they package the bun, and burger, and toppings all separate so everything is fresh is kinda amazing. The tots were crispy and really good. Delivery was super fast too.', u\"In the mood for some burgers and fries? This is a good place to stop by if you're close or if you can drive. Though be warned, parking on a Tuesday afternoon is not fun! But I digress. \\n\\nThe outside was hard for my boyfriend and I to find. Simply because it didn't have a sign that outright says it. However, if you walk closer to it, it definitely says the name. Inside is small but definitely cute with all their decor. The music isn't too loud so if you come with one other person, it's a nice place to eat and chat. The staff there is also friendly and willing to explain how each may taste. \\n\\nNext came the food. My boyfriend and I ordered the and thing, classic burger and fries (no tater tots today! Sad facing). The wait time was a bit long but totally worth it. The burger was tasty, but because there was liquid, if left for too long, the buns would've been soggy. Their hand cut fries were yummy but it was a bit too greasy. But the crispy-ness made it more forgiving for me!\\n\\nWould definitely come back to try their buttermilk chicken (:\", u\"I had a craving for burgers and fries so my girlfriend and I decided to browse the park slope area until we stumbled upon this small gem. The lack of space is made up by the abundance of flavor! \\n\\nWe ordered the gnarly burger, fried chicken sandwich, onion rings and hand cut fries. The burger topped with a runny egg, onions(perfectly cooked-raw onions are the worst), and two thick slabs of bacon was exactly what I needed to satisfy my burger craving. The fried chicken sandwich with the slaw and mayo was so darn good, I almost ordered a second one. The fries and rings were great as well but to be honest the burger and chicken sandwich was so freaking good, I forgot about everything else. \\n\\nThe staff was friendly and inviting when we entered, our server Lisa was super chill. To put things simple, this place was totally Gnarly! Can't wait to come back for another burger and chicken sandwich.\", u\"** I ordered take out from Caviar **\\nWow. What a beautiful, enticing menu. I had the loaded fries, and they were delicious and traveled well. My boyfriend had a burger, and they separated ingredients so it wouldn't get messed up. Because of that, it lost some of its tastiness, but it came with a cute note explaining it. It definitely wasn't gross. I can't wait to come here for real.\", u'I had \"the Beatles\" chicken Burger and the chicken wings. The burger has the thigh piece which goes great with the sauces inside. Also the chicken wings are quite delicious :D', u\"The food here is so good! I'm obsessed with the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich (I always want another one). Also the mighty wings are very scrumptious. I also tried the Texas beef brisket sandwich, very good as well and the hand cut fries.\\nPrickly Pear Lemonade is very refreshing!!! It has mint leaves in the beverage. \\nI always forget to take pics of the food, I will update!\", u'I\\'m one of those people who either cooks or goes out.  No grey areas of delivery or takeout for me.  But the other night, a literal and figurative perfect storm, that included ominous looking weather, no food in the fridge and the fact that hubby and kid were on their way home from Park Slope, colluded so I heard myself saying the following words:  \"Honey, why don\\'t you just pick up some takeout from that new Burger place on 7th. Avenue?\"\\n\\nClassic Burger:  Two Words:  Soggy Bun.  Gummy, even.  Plus the beef patty was dry and overcooked.\\n\\nButtermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich:  I managed to steal a bite from the kid and really liked the Chicken component.  Major potential there.  Juicy and surprisingly crispy given the challenges that takeout presents.  But again with the inedible, soggy bun.\\n\\nPortobello Burger:  Hubby was not very enthusiastic about this, mostly because he didn\\'t realize it was fried and he had been trying to make a healthier choice.  His bad, but maybe offering a lighter, more virtuous vegetarian sandwich alternative on the menu would broaden the appeal of this spot?  \\n\\nTater Tots:  Happily, these stayed crispy on the short ride home.  Unhappily, they were SUPER greasy.  In fact, I bit into one and oil oozed out of it.  This sealed it for me, leaving me with a deep and frankly, sick feeling of regret over eating any of this in the first place. \\n\\nNow I have a suspicion that had we dined in and eaten the Fried Chicken Sandwich immediately, it would have tasted pretty good.  Not too sure that applies to the rest of our meal.\\n\\nps  Lately, I\\'ve noticed a trend of sorts, with restaurateurs opening spots in tiny, minimalist spaces due, I\\'m assuming, to the prohibitive costs of operating a food business in NYC.   The resulting lack of comfortable seating and ambiance then lead to lots of takeout and delivery orders.  Meanwhile, the menu is almost perversely heavy in its inclusion of items that are challenging to package to-go, while still maintaining their integrity.  Talk about making it hard on yourself.'], u'94.Mirror Tea House': [u\"It's pretty cool place! Love the cool drinks here and the minimalistic space here! \\n\\nThey have mostly drinks and not so much food options so it's a great place to grab coffee. They said they will expand their menu and introduce food options too! Stay tuned! Great find!\", u'A relatively new Japanese inspired cafe in the area with truly inventive drinks. I walked by and saw pictures of a number of unique looking concoctions and had to try. I had the banana milk coffee, which was incredible. Half filled with banana infused(?) milk and half cold brew coffee. I recommend stirring it all together, but try both parts separately first to taste the quality of both parts on their own. Banana milk was almost like a milkshake, so good. Listed for $5, but was charged $6. Pretty pricey, but worth the try as you will not find this anywhere else. \\n\\nSpace itself is odd. All white with random assortment of tables and chairs. A drum set in the corner... you definitely know you are in Brooklyn. Cool place to check out nonetheless!', u'I love this space. There is jazz on the speakers, matcha (and many other Japanese specialties) brewing, and a beautiful light white box interior.\\n\\nIn need to get back to this review after checking out their open mic night event thursdays', u'This place has interesting drinks. I tried the cold brewed coffee with banana milk. The coffee is bitter so it tastes better after mixing the milk with the coffee. Place has  about 4 tables and 2  sofas. The bathroom is located all the way in the back. When I was there today the a band was practicing so it was loud and hard to have a convo. I would definitely comeback to try their other drinks.', u\"Tried this place based on my wife's curiosity. Amazing space. Uniquely delicious drinks. Super cool vibe. This is a dope addition to the 'hood. Welcome Mirror Tea House.\", u\"Very clean and quiet tucked away Caf\\xe9.  Not so quiet you can't speak & laugh out loud, but chill.  It's away with no store front and not very crowded.  Great cold brew and good music.\", u'Only recently discovered this cute Japanese tea spot serving a variety of legit Japanese hot and cold teas. Still need to try the banana milk latte drinks!!!', u'Great spot. Got an iced green tea (sencha). Very fresh good quality and such a nice space with beautiful interior. They were playing some jazz guitar music which made the vibe even better!! Will be back for sure', u\"Friend of mine took me to this cool Japanese cafe (he knew artsy proprietors Fumiho and Miho who used to run another cafe close by) after checking out another friend's art exhibit in Park Slope.  Great space converted from apartments (love that bathtub sculpture where a bathroom used to be!) with live performances and live art.  They got  great shake-like drinks like a milk banana matcha and a strawberry milk chocolate, but they had this huge rice ball dish to die for.   Highly recommend this place!\", u'Very nice and quaint tea house with amazing coffee blends!   Love their New Orleans style coffee!', u'Serene and pristine brownstone caf\\xe9, with calming and comfortable interior design by Hiroyuki Arima, one of Japan\\'s premier architects.

Five crystalline stars in a pure and clear night sky!'], u'151.Wolf and Deer': [u'Went here last week and loved it! The cocktails were very well crafted-- we tried the blueberry mojito, the spicy margarita, and the gin cocktail. All were amazing!!! My favorite was the spicy margarita it had a ghost pepper chili salt, and a slight mole flavor...it was a perfect balance of acidity, spice, and sweetness. The bartender was attentive and kind and the bar itself was very nice. I would totally come back!', u\"I put off writing a review here for almost two years because I didn't want to blow up my first date spot. But it's time to share the goodness that is Wolf & Deer as either a date meeting place or the perfect place to have an intimate catchup with a close friend. It's less ideal for a gathering with a small group of friends (anything over 4 and it feels cramped), but conversely I would recommend having a few people so that you can try ALL of the cheeses and charcuterie. If your stomach space for these items is more limited, the bartenders are all very knowledgeable about good pairings (and which wine and other drinks to try them with). The mustard and jam as accompaniments are also crucial and they will keep the bread coming as needed.\\n\\nThe happy hour deals here are pretty good, but the generous offering is that it goes until 8pm. You can usually still get a seat at 6pm and a few cocktails here make an excellent warmup for dinner down the block at Convivium Osteria (or Shake Shack or Artichoke).\\n\\nThe horseshoe-shaped bar can feel a little tight on the side with the bathroom, so I would recommend sitting on the other side or closer to the curve. There's also some tall table spots by the windows if you don't want to the bartender to hear your awkward first-date conversation.\", u'Once upon a time ... \\n\\nIt was a shadowy night in Park Slope Brooklyn.  The rain glistened quiet on the sidewalk with small specks of gold to Wolf and Deer.\\n\\nWithout a sign, and empty with the lights on before 5pm, the bar was unrecognizable in a shelled infancy.  It almost looked like a banquet room for a neighboring restaurant.\\n\\n5:05pm\\nThree people had now arrived, the lights dim, as a royal blue dusk, and shadows of trees listened to birds over head.\\n\\nThe bartender handed me a book.  \\nI flipped through the pages until I came to \"happy hour\".\\n$6 happy hour red wines came in two varietals.  I chose montepulciano which came a ruby grape red in a healthy 8 ounce pour, with a balanced taste of sweet fruit and dry, with smoky earth.  Vines curled around me, blossoming small white flowers that seemed to hum.\\n\\nI turned the page to the Lost Boy Kitchen where Little Red Riding Hood bruschetta, with shrimp, tarragon and marscapone, and three little pigs say macaroni and cheese with a jalape\\xf1o and prosciutto add on option plucked at my heartstrings to be beat by the happy hour charcuterie special of any 3 meats and or cheeses for $12. \\n\\nI didnt have time to read the ample cheese menu, with over 10, but instead focused on meat, and chose wagyu beef, duck and prosciutto.   The meat, like the wine was of good quality and a great value in such a large portion. \\n\\nI saw a page full of whiskeys, a page full of beers, and a page full of craft cocktails all affordably priced. A waterfall poured behind me into a crystal pool with dancing gold salamanders on rocks as happy fish swam underneath lily pads.  The humans multiplied in numbers at this packed small modern yet old world cozy feeling bar.\\n\\nWith $9 craft cocktails, $12 charcuterie boards and $6 wines happy hour is not to be missed if you are in Park Slope.\\n\\nI sprouted large strong wings and a gold brick path beckoned before me to another world.\\n\\nAnd I lived happily ever after.', u'I really like the fairytale/ bedtime story theme the bar has. The menu is attached to a story book. We went here for happy hour. Unfortunately, they went away with their happy hour meal deals and did not update their menus which was a bummer. I think the bartender said in they are in the process of re-doing it. The paninis are delicious. I got the \"three little pigs\"  without cheese. It had prosciutto and salami with side arugula salad and potato chips. My friends order the grilled cheese and they loved it. So that\\'s another option for the cheese lovers. The \"don\\'t fear the reaper\" is a must have drink too. The place is slightly small, its the bar with chairs surrounding it like a U.', u\"This place has a fantastic vibe! I had some time to kill around the area and was looking for a place to go. Wolf and Deer seemed to have the best wine list out of every place within reasonable walking distance so I chose to go here. When I first walked in, on a Saturday night, it was packed and I thought it was some hipster place... but the crowd thinned out a bit and the vibe changed a bit.\\n\\nThe wine list was pretty good... Not quite wine bar standard, but there were some decent options, better than what most bars tend to have. The atmosphere was great, the staff was friendly and not afraid to moderate the situation and cut people off if they are drinking too much, which I appreciate as a woman going out alone.\\n\\nWhat I really admired looking at though was their cocktail list. There were so many unique creations based on literature, and it was such a fun and unique concept, and reminded me of a library and bar I used to go to in Japan that had a similar theme.\\n\\nI'm not much of a cocktail person at all and prefer to drink wine, but even I was tempted to try one...\\n\\nI will definitely be back, probably for wine, unless I give into the temptation which is their rather impressive seeming cocktail list.\", u\"BK nights walking up 5th Ave after dinner with my IN-Loves (inlaws) and as we peeked in several bars the Vibe was amiss until we peeked into this place and felt the vibe that encouraged us to pop a squat at the bar. \\n\\nWe sat at the bar and Kelsey was in action working the bar with the various customers some being regulars and others newbies like us. Across the bar was a friendly smile from this young man who was indulging in hot wings sitting next to a nice older Asian guy. He sparked up convo and we cracked jokes while ordering our drinks with his help as well as Kelsey help. Later after his hot wing feast we learned his name is Gavin and he is a bartender as well. \\nWe ended up with 2 A Peck of Pepper and 1 Flowers in the Attic all made by Kelsey. Our drinks were amazing and we met some cool people in the process at the bar even a local restaurant owner who's restaurant we will try next week. \\n\\nThis place is small, trendy, smooth and appealing all wrapped up in a ball of Oooohh YEAH ..\", u\"In theory I'd really really like this place. They have craft cocktails, an amazing layout and a phenomenal cocktail program. Bonus points, if you're a Yelp cashback person, you get money back AND this place also offers miles for those that register their card for Delta dining. \\n\\nThat said it's quite small which means when it gets busy folks are breathing down your neck for a seat and not all bartenders are the same when it comes to a friendly, pleasant experience. \\n\\nWhile one was charming and pleasant, the other didn't seem keen to help others. Often very transactional, and seemingly like we were the ones burdening them. \\n\\nPerhaps that bartender was having a bad day. Perhaps it was just a busy time (although their not-quite-warm nature expended to slow times as well), but if you're looking for a no-frills, craft-made cocktail with a ton of aide benefits, come here!\", u'Good cocktails. Delicious apps. The space leaves a bit to be desired size wise, but has a great look.', u'Stopped in for their happy hour tonight and it was so fun! From the bartenders to the customers, everyone was friendly and welcoming. Their oysters were fresh (I think I ate 6 in 2 minutes). I ordered the cocktail named \"don\\'t fear the reaper\" and my bf ordered the \"bad apple.\" The bad apple was very strong. Rum smacked my taste buds as I took my first sip. The reaper drink reminded me of a mojito because of the mint (my favorite). I will definitely be back for oyster night!', u'Great cocktail bar in north slope. Craft cocktails and cute decor are a big draw for this space. Not too big and perfect for a quiet night in park slope! Cocktails are $14 and during happy hour they are $10. Food is also available, never had any personally but other ordering- looks delicious!', u'Great service from Kelsey and awesome craft cocktails. The partridge and a pear tree is yummers I love the atmosphere. I didnt try the food but heard it was great for bar food. Great spot to hang out with friends and catch up. I like a place I can talk to friends and get great customer service and drinks from the bartender. This place did that!', u\"I encountered this place when I was heading to key food for grocery in the car. The first thing that caught my attention was the big ice cubes they were carrying into the bar. In my mind, I'm like what is that place. As a yelper, I looked it up and I'm amazing by the wonderful reviews. So, I came here two time so far and on a Thursday. Every Thursday, they have oyster HH but the oysters came from different places both time I went. Let's talk about the drinks!! They have amazing drinks. I tried everything on the HH menu beside the first one. All of them are unique but I definitely enjoy the fruity or sweet cocktails. So, they have this new drink called bunny foo foo. Apparently, it's so new that they weren't sure how to make it or what cup it's suppose to go into. Also, they didn't have carrot bits to put on it even though it's one of the ingredients. So, they do run out of stuffs but you won't believe it. The chef goes to key food to get more ingredients since it's so close by!! Must try the meat board and definitely get the duck. It was soooo good. Overall, the experience was pleasant both times. Also, make sure to have some cash because one day their credit card system went down and they didn't know about it. They were trying to fix it on the line but it took just way too long and they were on the line for over 30mins. I don't know about you guys but I have better things to do than wait till the credit card system goes back online.\", u\"I had some time to kill and Wolf and Deer seemed like the perfect place to kill it.  They have a great happy hour from 5:00 - 8:00.  I love it when places extend happy hour to 8:00.  They have $9 cocktails and $5 beers.  It was a Tuesday so they also had pork sliders for $2 each that came in orders of two or six.  \\n\\nThe place is long and narrow.  Not a lot of space, but they make it work.  Immediately upon entering I was handed a menu that looked like a book.  Well that's because it was a book.  The first bunch of pages were the menu, but the rest was an actual book.  \\n\\nI usually just go for the beer, but since this was a cocktail spot and it was happy hour I decided on the Curious George.  The cocktail was bourbon, scotch, banana, lime, ginger and topped with some nutmeg.  This just sounded amazing and it was.  As I was sitting there I saw someone had ordered the pork sliders and they looked delicious, so I asked the bartender for an order of three.  These came out fairly quickly and were quite amazing.  The bun was just the right size for the amount of meat and they pork was very moist and just melted in your mouth.  If you are there on a Tuesday you need to order these.\", u'Coool amazing place. I loved the drinks and especially the cheese plate and grilled cheese.', u'I haven\\'t written a review for Wolf and Deer? Blasphemy. This place is one of my favorite cocktail bars..... when I can get a seat. \\n\\nAlas the only strike against this place is that the place is somewhat on the smaller side. I\\'d say arrive at the right time, but who knows what the right time is. I\\'ve been there at \"dead\" hours and it was packed. Been there for the \"busy\" hours and there were several spots available. Basically, just get lucky. \\n\\nThey make do with the space they have. The bars narrow U shape design that enables the staff to operate behind the bar, with a door at the end to exit. There\\'s some space in the front, I\\'d recommend it if you came with a crew. Though this place isn\\'t a place you come with a crew. \\n\\nWhat makes the place clutch is that it has a happy hour that goes till 8. We all can\\'t make it to that happy hour that goes till 7. We have to work. You gotta squeeze in the gym. Or you know, stare at your phone for endless hours, escaping the non exist meaning of life..... Oh wait, back to the review. \\n\\nThey know how to make drinks here. If you don\\'t like anything on the menu, they\\'ll make you something you like. The design of the bar is beautiful. Their glasses placed above the bar are a nice touch. It goes hand in hand with the wonderful cocktails they make. \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t say this is a place to get dinner, rather it a place to nibble or grab a snack. They have a few dishes which go perfectly with your drinks. And there are beers to have as well, though what\\'s the point of going to a cocktail bar and not getting cocktails. So make sure you at least get one. \\n\\nThere\\'s various reasons to be in this particular spot in Brooklyn. It\\'s essentially the center of it. If you\\'re in the mood for a drink, try stoping by here.', u'Great bar!! Love the drinks and coziness. Went in with guy friends after a basketball game, and they were in awe of how delicious the cocktails were - even though they were looking for a beer spot. The cocktails were really good, we tried a variety of them, but I can\\'t recall the names. The male bartender (Sunday night) was also awesome, made us some really cool shot-tail just by me asking him to \"please make it strong, and please add some mint\". I would recommend it, especially if you\\'re looking for a place to taste some mixology skills!', u'Next up trying the drink\" smoke on the water\"- scotch and mezcal cocktail - it was ok.', u\"We came here literally as the place opened at 5 before our Ranger/Islander game at the Barclays. Our bartender, Jackson, was one of the top 5 bartenders I have ever had make me a drink. Wolf and Deer is a small place, that gets packed once 6:00pm hits so grab a seat at the bar while you can. They are labeled as a wine bar but I think more craft than just wine because of all the cocktails, hand crafted in front of you and a few craft beers on tap. \\n\\nThe happy hour deals are the craziest part! Especially Thursdays when they have $1 oysters. However, they did not have any oysters cleaned and shucked til 6:15 when happy hour starts at 5. Our bartender was apologetic that we had to wait over an hour for a dozen oysters but we finally got them 15 minutes before we left. They came stacked on a small plate and we weren't handed small plates so eating them was a little difficult. \\n\\nThe cheese and charcuterie are top notch. They do a mix of three usually for $15 but HH, mix of three for $12. We started with that because of the oyster issue and had a couple cocktails to start. The Charlotte's Web was great and smooth mouth feel from the egg white. My girlfriend's cocktail came from the bartender recommendation but I forgot the name but loved the little spice after you sipped it.\\n\\nI would easily come back here but hopefully the oysters are ready. The reason I would come back is the bartending and the menu are easily some of the best in the area, especially with an amazing happy hour.\", u\"Cute cocktail bar with cool ambience. Great date spot. The menus are inside classic books, great way to spark conversation and impress your literature-loving dates and friends! Drinks aren't cheap but the cocktails are good. Worth checking out.\", u\"Wow this place is just awesome. A tiny little bar with great happy hour specials, this place caters to wine, beer, and cocktail lovers. The bar is very narrow which gives the place an intimate setting. I came here with my boyfriend before the Rangers game to grab some drinks and a bite to eat. Their happy hour is amazing - special priced house cocktails, $12 cheese and meat board, and $1 oysters!!! \\n\\nWe arrived a little after the place opened and sat at the bar. We chatted with the bartender Jackson who was very nice! The menu itself is very cool they're books! I had the drink Where the Wild Things Are and my boyfriend had the Charlottes Web. Mine was sweet with a nice little spice on the end of the drink and my boyfriends was nice and creamy from the egg white. \\n\\nThey have a good selection of meats and cheeses on the menu. However, we were a little disappointed with the oysters. We had to wait over an hour for them when they should have been ready by 5. Not sure what was going on in the kitchen - they were very slow. \\n\\nWe have another event at the Barclays center and I plan on coming back here beforehand. Jackson was the best bartender! He was very nice and he even took 20% off our bill AND gave us a free beer! This place rocks and I will definitely be back.\"], u'189.Guadalupe Inn': [u'These guys kill it.\\n\\nFriendly staff and great high-quality food. Everything on the menu is GF and DELICIOUS. Like actually my mouth is watering right now. \\n\\nCan we talk about Happy Hour? Best Happy Hour $6 Margaritas and $3 tacos/quesadillas. Too legit. You actually cannot beat that price... and they use high quality ingredients... and they make the tastiest... and the staff is friendly?!?!?!? \\n\\nIts hard to believe such a place exists but its really real. \\n\\nOh, and if ya wanna just grab dinner? Yeah thats dank too and the prices for what you get again AHHH. Does not get better than this. Thank you taco, guac and margarita Gods you have outdone yourself.', u\"A group of friends and I came here for dinner the other night, and I'm a fan!\\n\\nTheir Mezcal margarita is delicious, and it paired well with a shared order of the guacamole, as well as my steak entree. While I don't make it a habit to order meat, since it isn't something I enjoy on a regular basis, it nonetheless was perfectly prepared and served medium, as requested. And accompanied by sides of beans, onions and peppers, and corn tortillas, more than my share! I took half to go.\\n\\nFurthermore, the staff is both friendly and efficient. I'd definitely return!\", u'I almost hate to give this restaurant a good review because it\\'s so good that I\\'m afraid people will start crowding the place. But it\\'s so under appreciated and delicious that I\\'m afraid it will go out of business unless I say something because it\\'s never crowded. \\n\\nThe service is great and the food is delicious. It\\'s the part of Mexican cuisine that you rarely get to try in New York. The kind that would come from a classy Mexico City high end restaurant. \\n\\nMy main mistake here is I always order the guac and it\\'s so generous I\\'m almost full every time my dinner shows up. \\n\\nIt\\'s beautifully decorated which makes you think you\\'re eating at a much more expensive restaurant but the prices are incredibly affordable for the ambience and quality of food you\\'re getting. The ambience is so chill and relaxed I found most of their music on my \"doin\\' it\" playlist.', u\"5 stars for live music and the whole menu is gluten free! I came here on a Friday night. We made reservations the day of with no problems. When we walked in my boyfriend remembered the place because he turned on their gas (National Grid). That was really funny. the dining room in the back is where the stage is. The stage is very pretty. That night they had a live band and the band was great. We really enjoyed the music. We had to pay 10\\nDollars each for the show, which was added to our bill. We each ordered cocktails and enjoyed them. As an appetizer we had a corn masa taco with carnitas. I loved the corn masa. It was crispy and had great flavor. They were delicious. For entrees, my boyfriend and I both ordered a whole branzino cooked in banana leaves. It came with vegetables on the side. The fish was cooked perfectly. We both really enjoyed it. We loved Guadalupe Inn and I can't wait to return!\", u\"Guadalupe Inn is a restaurant/lounge that you want to spend the whole night eating and drinking. We arrived around 7:30 right before the music/show was suppose to start.  They do charge a small fee for the show, but it is so worth it. We sat in the front. The restaurant is beautiful. It's very romantic with low light and very elegant. It is perfect for a date. The staff is super nice and helpful. \\n\\nFor drinks we started out with sangria and moved on with the last kiss. It is super addicting and I recommend getting that from the very beginning. \\n\\nFor dinner we started with the zucchini flowers. They are fried and stuffed with cheese. They come with a lovely sauce to dip.\\n\\nWe ordered for dinner the al pastor. The best thing I think on the menu. It is def to share, for three people at least. If you love pork, this is the dish for you. It has roasted pineapple, spicy sauces to dress up your taco and it was just amazing. \\n\\nWe also ordered the skirt steak it came with a side of creamy peppers and onions also refried beans. I had thought the sides were delicious but the steak was a little chewy. Def stick with the al pastor. \\n\\nWe had to skip dessert because we ordered to much for dinner!\\n\\nOverall, this restaurant is so unique! The music was amazing, the staff was great and so was the food and drinks! I will def come back and I would love to try dessert next time. Come here for a fun time.\\n\\nParking was not difficult (290)\", u\"I had super high expectations after seeing a video of this place but honestly I have better Mexican down the street. Their queso is good but it gets cold really quick and that makes it look greasy and taste okay at best. Their tacos are also okay, nothing to rave about. My favorite thing was actually their Inn salad with Tuna. It was really good and has just the right amount of dressing. I'd come back for the salad but nothing else. Their drinks are also not the best. I guess if you're ever in the mood for a good tuna salad come here otherwise skip it.\", u'This place is so Bushwick-typical - diamond in the rough. It took me like 5 minutes to make sure I was in the right area because its industrially desolate and then another 5 minutes to make sure it was the right place. Once found, it is such a swanky gem. Beautiful space with a 40s cabaret type stage. \\n\\nThe staff is really friendly - one waitress gave me my new favorite word when she described a dessert: moisty. I use the word moisty atleast once a day now #lifegoals\\n\\nThe food and drinks are delicious. My favorites are ceviche de coliflor y pulpo con mole. But the burlesque is awesome. Frida personality is fiesty, fun and makes the whole experience.', u'Came here with my boyfriend on a Wednesday night for dinner. As soon as we walked in we were greeted warmly and the guy at the front quickly directed us to our table. Drinks were flavorful and strong. Had a few margaritas and a last kiss, which was my favorite. We ordered only appetizers, guacamole with chips, queso fundido(melted cheese) with steak, Aguachile de Pulpo y Camar\\xf3n (octopus and shrimp, jalape\\xf1o citrus, red onion, avocado, cucumber; blue corn totopos) and for desert we got Churros Rellenos de Cajeta\\n(churros filled with goat milk caramel) everything was delicious and the service was an A plus! Loved the lived music and the burlesque performance while drinking and eating yummy food.', u'My favorite Mexican restaurant in New York City !!! Saturday night live show and outstanding service!! Holy guacamole the food here is just amazing...', u\"The nice corner location on Knickerbocker has changed again, this time into a nice Mexican spot that all the blogs are comparing to Cosme.\\n\\nIt's not quite as stuffy and expensive, but it's definitely a little more upscale than a typical Mexican joint. And most importantly, all of the food is incredible.\\n\\nStarting with the hot, crispy Chips and Guacamole ($9), to a great little trio of Tostadas topped with Tuna ($12), to the main event, the Trompito al Pastor ($28), everything is better than the last thing you tried. That last dish seems pricey, but it really isn't considering the huge pile of meat you get and the stack of amazing tortillas that you get to make your own tacos, you will be very pleased and satisfied.\\n\\nFor dessert, the Chocolate Tres Leches is an absolute must ($8). I really want to come back already to try more of the menu.\", u\"Had such a great experience here! I know it's relatively new to the scene but there were no evident growing pains. Before going, make sure you check their event calendar. If you happen to arrive during showtime and eat in the dining room, instead of in the bar (which includes traditional bar stools and cute booths), the price of the ticket will be added onto each person's bill. We got there around Happy Hour (which includes $3 tacos and $6 margaritas and runs until 7:00PM) and sat in one of those cute, comfy booths. First impression: the decor was on point and the margaritas were strong! Just came back from Tulum and felt like we'd never left. \\n\\nWe ordered the Flor de Calabaza Rellena for $12 to start (roughly translates to a filled squash blossom). The only way I can contextualize it (and I say this happily) is fancy county fair food. The blossom was battered and fried to perfection with sweet corn and cheese inside. It came with 4 flowers and a mole sauce to dip. We also ordered the carne asada tacos because, happy hour ($3) and they were so fresh and simple - letting the flavors speak for themselves! \\n\\nMost of the mains are suggested to be shared between 2-3 people. We ordered the Trompito Al Pastor ($36), which roughly translates to little spinning top of pork. Sounds fun, right? To our immense relief, the pork wasn't spinning. It did have the shape of halal lamb on a spit- conical and juicy. It came with pineapple, a bunch of standard taco toppings (onion, cilantro, lime) and tortillas. The ratio wasn't the best. We ended up with 0 tortillas, a ton of toppings, and half the pork. But at that point we were actually full. \\n\\nFor dessert DO NOT SKIP the churros filled with goat milk caramel ($8). So good!\\n\\nOverall, a bit pricey, but you know the ingredients are fresh, the food is delicious, and it's just so pretty inside.\", u'the huevos rancheros were good but a bit plain and boring, elegant presentation, nice space,  pleasant service', u\"KenScale: 8.5/10\\n\\nIt's been a while since my girlfriend and I had a tasty Mexican dinner, so we wanted to try a new place where we could dip some chips on the guacamole accompanied by margaritas. Guadalupe Inn has long been on my radar since it opened, but its location in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn made it harder to make that trip all the way from Manhattan. On a recent Sunday, after watching a Broadway show, we finally decided to head over to Guadalupe Inn. By the time we arrived at the restaurant, we were both nearly starving to death. Is that why the meal at Guadalupe Inn was extra special? I couldn't tell, but my girlfriend and I both agreed that the food here was quite legit. \\n\\nWe both love adding spicy elements to dishes, and Mexican cuisine certainly does that quite well. Unlike other run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurants in the city, though, the balance of flavor was quite impressive at Guadalupe Inn. Start with guacamole with habanero pepper. Yes, the pepper made the guacamole spicy but there was no other extra seasoning to threaten the integrity of the dish. I think we could've finished the entire guacamole if not for the other dishes that were coming in. Corn masa tostada with avocado puree, pickled cabbage and sea salt chili powder also displayed wonderful complexity of flavor that wasn't overwhelming to my palate. My girlfriend couldn't stop raving about the texture of the grilled octopus with dark plum mole beneath, and I couldn't agree more. The textural beauty from the octopus and the potatoes that accompanied it was quite memorable. The weakest dish of the night was shredded chicken tacos topped with cabbage and queso fresco. Unlike the other dishes, this one definitely needed to tone down on seasoning. Our mild disappointment, however, was quickly solved with the decadent, show-stopper trompito al pasta dish, a beautiful stack of marinated pork on top of grilled pineapple that you can add to handmade corn tortillas along with onion and cilantro. The pork was beautifully cooked, and the chili used for marinating it was quite tasty as well without being heavy. My girlfriend and I couldn't stop happily putting together the tortillas and devouring them quickly on bites after bites. For dessert, that childhood favorite churros is the way to go. Unlike the typical churros, though, the one at Guadalupe Inn is filled with goat milk caramel, adding another delightful element to an already delightful dish. I still can't forget the face of my girlfriend savoring every single bite on the churros.\\n\\nGetting a reservation at Guadalupe Inn wasn't too difficult, and the restaurant was not full during our meal, so you can perhaps even try walking in. There is a full bar, and the cocktails at the restaurant were rather well made. The shiny dining space, which also features shows like burlesques at some nights, was somewhat at odds with the vibe of Bushwick, and I wish the lighting was adjusted so that my photos of the food came out looking more delicious. In any event, Guadalupe Inn certainly exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend the restaurant to anyone who wants a new place to get their Mexican fix.\", u\"Just tried this place for this first time, and I must say it was a very enjoyable experience! I'm a sucker for Mexican food and I've passed this place several times and admired the cute little outdoor aesthetics of this restaurant. We got there a little late so it was pretty empty, but there were a few tables taken (a good amount of people for 9:45 pm). We started with guac and chips. Homemade, warm chips are my favorite. These were warm and seemingly homemade but tasted a little stale. The guac was good, though, so the chips didn't bother me too much. I got a grapefruit margarita, very different but very yummy! Definitely would order it again. My boyfriend and I both got the carne asada tacos which were DELICIOUS. Seriously sooo good yet simple and just really juicy flavor. The salsa verde went perfect on them. My boyfriend wanted rice and beans which he got on the side and they weren't anything special, but not bad. Finally, we ended with churros and those were delicious as well! Filled with caramel, so warm and gooey. I wish the prices were a little less steep, but for now this will be our go-to Mexican spot in the area. Very cool bar area too! Will definitely return.\", u'Amazing food, great music, super cute place. The Guadalupe salad is fantastic!\\nHighly recommended!', u\"This has to be the best spot in Williamsburg Brooklyn I have been to. Amazing service and amazing food. Desi was our waitress and she was amazing. From the moment we came in she was warm and kind, and made our experience 10x better. She provided insight on things we didn't know about and was helpful thru out our whole stay. \\n\\nThis place is phenomenal. Amazing music and the food is extraordinary. I had the Baja fish tacos and the trompitos al pastor was to die for. Feeds two people and was delicious. The boozy brunch is worth the $20 extra. It is made with fresh juice and just taste better then any other mimosa I have tasted.\", u\"I will give Guadalupe 4 stars and not five only because I'm not a fan of their food. But everything else deserves a 5! The staff is super attentive and friendly, the shows and venue are amazingggg, and the drinks are super delish! I'll definitely be back here again, I love this place.\", u'The food and atmosphere was great. However I was approached multiple times by staff reminding me that a large party was on the way and they needed the table.  I felt pressured and rushed, its fine that you need space but paying customers should not be rushed!!! A party of two can spend the same amount of money if not more, if not rushed!', u\"I simply love this place first time here with my friends and the food was amazing! The neighborhood made me think the place was just a regular Mexican restaurant but when you walk in it's like you're at a fine dining restaurant. The service was fast and the environment was really pleasant. It took me a while to realize that the music was actually played by actual musicians, I noticed when they started talking to the audience. Aside from all the food and drinks were really good and the staff were very friendly I will come again with my friends.\", u'Sitting no longer than 30 minutes and the manager Geraldo sent over the waitress to advise us we had to be done within  the next 15 minutes because they had another party coming in for the table.  I then asked the waitress to call him over. He proceeded to the  table and first said she miss understood and then said he was talking about the table next to us that left 15 min prior...TERRIBLE...\\nNever again and I suggest you find somewhere else to go!!'], u'106.Lincoln Station': [u\"Initially came in here only because it was a short walk from Brooklyn Botanic Garden and my bf & I really had to charge our phones before heading to our next destination. It's a very large cafe with lots of seating, including a big island/stools in the middle with an outlet. The table wasn't cleared from the previous people who were sitting there but it's a casual cafe so we didn't mind at all. \\n\\nGot a strawberry tea which was delicious (soo potent) and an order of fries that were PERFECT. So crispy and flavorful...again, they were perfect. The people around us also had food that looked great like the brussel sprout salad. Even though we chanced upon this place, would love to come again.\", u\"I'll admit: I've only stopped here for tea to go a few times before wandering around Prospect Park or the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Still, it's a godsend because it's really the only cafe in the immediate vicinity of that area of the park.\\n\\nThe layout is cool and the vibe is welcoming; while many people shared a communal table in the middle, covered with laptops, many sat around the periphery and at small outdoor tables eating, drinking, and chatting. \\n\\nThe price of a cup of tea was a little high ($3!!!), but the other food items (sandwiches, soups, et al) were reasonably priced, definitely under $10 dollars. Perhaps on my next visit to this area, I'll treat myself to a proper meal here and not just a tea on the run; the vibe is enough to bring me back again!\", u\"Not bad for a rainy day. A friend and I sat here for a quick bite. The focaccia pizza and coffee were great, yummy and satisfying.   It worked for a little while, but the music was a bit too loud and the seating isn't very comfortable for long talks so we got moiving. I would visit again but only as a lone diner.\", u\"Delicious egg sandwich. I've been wanting to check this place out and it did not disappoint.\", u\"Always happy to stop in for the amazing Avo-egg sandwich.  The brussels sprouts are good too. These are my go-tos so I can't speak to much else, but judging by those you won't be sorry. \\nThe staff is friendly and the vibe is relaxed. If you have a doggy you can sit outside in nice weather.\", u'My morning run became a groggy walk that led me to Lincoln Station. It turned out that I\\'d  already YELPmarked it after having seen another reviewer praise the \"potent strawberry tea.\" Literally next to Brooklyn Museum and (2)(3) trains.. I thought it\\'d be more crowded at 7:30a? With a shorter wait than I expected, I fumbled and ordered a dirty chai. No chai tea, but the barista suggested I substitute Earl Grey as the next spiciest. He called it a \"Dirty London Fog\". Haha. A pun. I took it.  My cup was delightfully smooth + quite large for a small. I wasn\\'t expecting that for a 4-buck-drink. Will be back for the strawberry tea!', u'Super cool vibe. Nice menu. I went in starving and hoping that the brisket sandwich I ordered was good. Seats are first come, soon as the food arrived i was so happy to see such a beautiful sandwich. My photo did not do justice. First off the bread! It was so tasty, there was a nice soft chewy texture and slight crunch on the outer crust. The combination of slaw, blue cheese and BBQ sauce was the freshest flavor trio, that totally gave me glimpse of summer. It was perfectly balance and I wish I can be hungry and eat more of it. Compliments to the chefs.', u\"Aaaaaah. Lincoln Station! I think owned by the same people who have Bar Corvo? One of my absolute favs.\\nI love coming here on a BEAUTIFUL day, getting a sandwich and eating it on the steps of the Brooklyn Museum right around the corner.\\n\\nAll the sandwiches are fair, and they have a delicious rotation of soups! But the fries, OH THE FRIES! While the seasoning is alright the TEXTURE of these badboys is divine! I mean fo realsies. Crispy and perfectly fried on the outside, while still keeping some substance in the middle. delicious I could eat them for days!\\n\\nPrepare yourself for crowds of laptop clickers spacing themselves out on the communal table, though they don't allow laptops on the round tables which helps. Also pretty sure they serve beer? So you can get a nice little buzz on while you people watch.\", u'Toured the Brooklyn Museum and wanted lunch close by. This is it!  5 minute walk. Lamb chili is awesome. Ambiance is that of a casual, neighborhood hang out. Loved it.   They have wine and beer too.', u\"We just came to NY for visiting and found this terrible cafe in Yelp. We were there for brunch. \\nThe guy at the counter is very rude and he is not willing help at all. The service is awful and I don't think he deserves a tip!! Never ever give them Tip.\", u\"This place is so chill. I love to come in for breakfast before going to the Brooklyn Museum, or come in after for lunch. This morning I had a bacon/egg/cheese/brioche breakfast sandwich and read the paper as the snow came down outside. Can't beat that!\", u'A year after my original review, LS definitely deserves an upgrade.  Food and drink across the board has improved.  Even the hot coffee (while still on the bitter side) is now worth waking up for.  Food-wise, there is something for everyone if you come with a group, and the oft-changing specials are usually appealing as well.  (They\\'ve even gotten in on the \"bone broth\" trend recently.)  \\n\\nOnly downside would be that LS has gotten pretty popular of late, so if you come in for food during a peak time, you\\'ll be hard-pressed to find a seat, and the kitchen can take a while.  Using seamless to make an order to pick up is a pro move.', u\"After visiting the BBG with my family, we decided to stop here for lunch. This spot is very casual, you walk up to order your food and then they bring it to the table. They do serve beer, as well as coffee/espresso and regular soft drinks. The menu is pretty small but all of their options sound equally delicious. \\n\\nWe got the following stuff and I don't think there were any complaints..\\n-Pulled pork sandwich (this has a serious kick to it and its a huge sandwich, I enjoyed it).\\n-Brisket sandwich (my sister said it was good, I had a taste and agreed but found the pulled pork to be a more flavorful sandwich personally).\\n-Roast chicken sandwich (I didn't try it myself but my other sister loved it and ate the entire thing!)\\n-Fried broccoli side (which is a big portion was easily shared by all of us, it was really yummy and I think my favorite side out of what we ordered)\\n-Mac & Cheese (you can definitely tell it was homemade, made with penne pasta, it was good)\\n-French Fries (served in a bag and were your standard fries, pretty good but I like mine a little bit more well done).\\n\\nI enjoyed an IPA on tap with my food (didn't catch the name) but it was good. I would recommend giving this place a try if youre in the neighborhood.\\n\\nFYI - its not cheap.\", u\"The parking isn't that great. Every time I visit this place I always had a hard time looking for a place to park my car. However, the place looks nice, it's clean and had a lovely ambiance. Placed an order, had a Grain bowl with chicken and Porchetta sandwich. The food was great, but it's a bit pricey. I will visit this place again because of the delicious food and great customer service.\", u'it sort of reminded me of the worst of the worst in \\'tudy-magnitude over-the-top Pacific Northwest new-ish-but-forcing-the-\"isn\\'t-this-homey?\"-vibe(less) coffee-snob destination. It\\'s not a complete loss, as the coffee is actually not bad, though they\\'ll outright correct you if you say it\\'s one thing and they refer to it as another - like, perhaps it\\'s a Seattle thing(?), but I\\'ve always known drip coffee with a shot (or more) of espresso in it to be called a \"shot in the dark\", though I also have heard \"red eye\" or \"black beauty.\" So, I just said \"12 oz double shot in the dark\" as my order and waited to see if they got it, and they blinked at me, and thus I began to understandably convey the ingredients and the counter person interrupted with a \"red eye... they want a red eye\" to the barista. Okay. You say tomatoes and I say tomatoes. \\n\\nI\\'m not that worked up over the monotonous reception I received the few times I gave it a shot, but I guess the taste of the coffee doesn\\'t really warrant any further visits, let alone making it a regular destination for my java. It\\'s a bit overpriced, unfriendly, pretentious, and you know, they interrupt you with their version of tomato/tomato. \\n\\nNEXT.', u\"My cousin lives here right down the street so he told me he often comes here for brunch and coffee. So I decided to come with him to try it out. I felt that the food was pretty average for the price. We had: \\n- The chicken sandwich (was like a chicken salad between sandwich buns) it was good but there was more mayo/sauce on it than necessary. The chicken was kind of dry.\\n- Grain bowl with chicken. Maybe it's just the grain but it was kinda (how should I say it) crunchy? It felt undercooked but I don't know how I feel about it exactly because maybe I just never had something like that before. \\n-Hot latte: they use Le Colombe coffee but the latte was kind of bland. \\n\\nIt is a nice, kinda hip, local place to grab some food and coffee. Maybe I just came on an off day. Maybe ill give it another try some other time.\", u\"Good drip coffee and had it to go. Quick service and nicest part was having an area to keep your dog outside. They have big windows that make it easy to look outside and look after your dog. It's not far from Prospect Park so we took the coffee to go as we were headed to the park. Outdoor seating is available as well as food, mainly small deli foods and sandwiches.\", u\"If you're looking for a good hangover cure their egg sandwich is the.best.ever. Yes, it's $6 but after a night of debauchery when you're dehydrated with a pounding headache and can barely get dressed Lincoln Station saves the day with their egg sandwich served on a buttery brioche bun, with perfectly cooked eggs, and topped with their homemade spicy sauce. \\n\\nGiving them three stars cause their service is god awful slow.\", u\"Overrated hipster place that I won't visit again . Egg sandwich that cost you arm & leg and it's mediocre ! Yeah no thanks never again! Buh bye !\", u'Great place to come if you want to be scolded by your hipster dad who works behind the counter. My girlfriend had the audacity to inquire just how bleu cheesy the bleu cheese slaw was... bad move. \"Uh.. I don\\'t have, like, any frame of reference for that\" was the answer she received. Now, as someone who has worked in food service, I could understand the risk in giving an answer to this question and then regretting it later. But a person who is more concerned about providing good service (aka, their job) could have just as easily said, \"It really depends on your taste preferences\" or \"do you want to try it?\" Clearly, service is a major issue here. Now I hate people who leave bad Yelp reviews based entirely on service, so, onto the food. \\n\\n$20 bucks for a sandwich on a brioche bun and a cup of soup is highway fucking robbery. A $16 sandwich had better be, in the words of our president elect, YUGE. This was not that. The pulled pork was fine, but nothing mind blowing. It wasn\\'t a bad offering, just ridiculously overpriced. The soup was actually pretty good, no complaints on that. \\n\\nIn sum: overpriced food with decent flavor, small portions, and rude service. There are too many options nearby to waste your time here.'], u'160.Cafe Tibet': [u'My friend and I went there like mouth ago. Everything was perfect. Only one little thing..we were waiting for a long time for our food. But maybe because they were making fresh momo for me. Haha. The prices are fair!\\nThe food is great there, very pleased service, nice atmosphere. \\n Will be back!:)', u'Deliciously spicy food! \\nPlace is narrow and cramped with some outdoor seating. Been here 3x already and food is good. CASH only. Place can get busy.\\n\\nShogo-katsa: spicy curried potatoes. Spicy and good! \\n\\nLa-phing: mung bean appetizer. Consistency of mung bean is like smooth jelly. The sauce is deliciously spicy, somewhat numbing. It is definitely much spicier than the curried potatoes. I really like this and I recommend ppl to try it!\\n\\nThen thuk- tibetan noodle soup. The \"noodle\" is actually more shaped like square raviolis. The dough is thick. (try saying this sentence out loud 5x). It\\'s also a spicy soup and flavor was ok. It\\'s very warming and perfect for the cold months. It was made more flavorful when I put extra hot sauce in it.\\n\\nShrimp thali- the order is served on a school lunchroom type of metal tray with a spot for curried shrimp, lentil soup, beets, veggies, and rice or white bread (tingmo). The curry was actually really good. It was so flavorful. Somewhat sweet.\\n\\nTibetan iced tea- I asked the waitress and she said it\\'s made of milk and some kind of spice which I don\\'t remember what she said (cardamom maybe??) it was sweet and very fragrant. Tasted really floral. It took some time for me to get used to the taste. The drink somewhat calmed my spicy tongue which was nice.', u\"I went here today for the first time with high expectations based on the stellar reviews.  I left extremely disappointed, and based on what people have written, it seems that this restaurant used to be much better in the past...\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I arrived here a few minutes past 12:30pm, right when they opened.  It took me maybe 5-10 minutes to decide what to order - I decided to get the veggie sha-baklap, my boyfriend picked the pork chili, and combo momos to share. I liked the ambiance of the restaurant and enjoyed the smell of burning incense.  Fast forward to 40 minutes after we placed our order, we still did not receive any food.  The pork chili dish was the first to come out, and I had to watch my boyfriend eat his dish alone as I didn't want his food to get cold.  I'm sure the waitress, at this point, noticed I was visibly upset since she came up to me and said the rest of the food will take a little longer because it needs to be fried.... I couldn't really understand this since fried foods are generally quick to come out.\\n\\nI noticed that someone who came much later than us received his fried momos right before we did. Anyway, we FINALLY got the rest of the food, and to be honest I thought both the momos and sha-baklap were very bland.  The sha-baklap dough was crispy but flavorless, and the veggies did not taste seasoned at all. I liked the chicken momo the most out of all three. I ended up just eating one sha-baklap and taking the other two to go.\\n\\nI would not come back to this place, especially due to the extremely long wait when the restaurant was not busy.  I pretty much had to wait an hour to do less than 10 minutes of eating. Bill came out to $40 for these three items which I thought was overpriced for what it was.\", u\"My fianc\\xe9 and I have been dying to try this place, but our schedules haven't allowed for it. Today we finally dropped in and were so bummed out. \\n\\nThe service was just weird and confusing. There were two waitresses and one woman behind the counter for 3 tables dining. When we got there one guest was leaving and one guy was already eating. We sat down and got menus and no one was taking out order. We kept staring at the waitresses but they weren't paying us mind. Finally when two other women came after us, they paid attention and took our order.  We just ordered two iced teas and beef Momos. Now I understand it's a small place, but there was barely anyone dining and they had more than enough staff for the tables they had. We waited like 45 minutes for momos that were honestly bland. What really annoyed us was that the women who came after us ordered like 3 dishes and were served immediately and constantly checked on. We had to wave someone down repeatedly for a check. I asked for a coffee to go and the check. She said ok sure and dropped the check and left. Another 10 minutes to get her attention to tell her the coffee was not on the check she said ok I'll get it. The other woman comes and said what were you asking her? I said I asked for a coffee to go but it's not on the check and she says oh we don't have coffee. ---- why is coffee on the menu then? And why couldn't the waitress tell me that the first time I ordered? \\n\\nI honestly just think they didn't care for us as customers. They just wanted us out which we were more than happy to do. The iced tea was amazing! But not worth a trip back if we aren't valued as customers.\", u\"What a gem!!!!! My friend had just been talking to me about how he hasn't found a great Tibetan restaurant in NYC but it seems like this is it.\\n\\nIt's a tiny little restaurant in the neighborhood where I played soccer growing up. Woah that makes me sound like Bernie or someone as old as him. Anyways, it is really really small. I say it seats at most 20? That was the only downside! It was a small area so my friends and I had to sit at the biggest table (table for 4), which was right by the door. All the cold air kept us freezing throughout the meal.\\n\\nWe ordered momos, lamb thali, and beef curry. All three were delicious. I've had better momos but I really enjoyed the lamb and beef. Nothing was spicy so don't be afraid to try random things! The thali is an excellent deal because it comes with many side dishes on a platter. Their steamed bread was great. I highly recommend it over rice. \\n\\nI think my favorite part of it all was the drinks we got. My friend and I got the Tibetan iced tea and my friend got the avocado, cream and banana shake. I'm forgetting the name. This iced tea was LIT. Wow please drink it. Now. The shake was also so good. I might need to get both next time. Ruh-roh!\", u'Awesome Tibetan food. Phing-Sha with beef came in a large portion; delicious tomato based broth. Chicken momos took a while to come out, but really good (the sauce with it is the best part). \\n\\nService was very slow; they only had one waitress for the whole restaurant. Even though the restaurant is small, took a while to get our order taken, etc. Not a great atmosphere, but you come here for the food.', u\"Can't say enough good things about Cafe Tibet. \\n\\nThe service was kind, prompt and very welcoming. They were knowledgeable, and really believed in their product. \\n\\nThe food was fresh, and I could really feel the LOVE that went into its preparation. I had the Vegan Momo Balls, and Chana-katsa\\n\\nBeautiful atmosphere as well!\", u\"Food is great, service can be better. When it was busy, the waitresses completely forgot about our table. They also seem to not understand a lot of English. It was strange but I'll probably order to-go from now.\", u\"This is my favorite restaurant in my neighborhood.  I usually come here for their lunch special 12pm-4pm.  It's a really good deal since you get chicken, lamb, pork, or vegetable thali with 2 sides of your choice, papadum (cracker), and daal (stewed lentils).  For the sides, I like the chickpeas and okra.  It's so much food that I never finish it.  I always bring home more than half of it.  It's a great deal for $9.99.  The food is freshly made and made of scratch.  If you have room, get the momos as well.  The combo gives you 3 of each: beef, chicken, and vegetable.  I like the beef momos the best if you want to try but don't want to eat all of them in the combo.  FYI, it's cash only and the place is small so not much seating for large groups.\", u\"I would go to eat here everyday if I could. Words can't explain how great this little restaurant is. I stumbled on it about a year ago and go as much as I can! The food is great, their spicier dishes are out of this world and so are the dumplings! I have brought all my friends here and they love it too!! Wish it wasn't cash only but oh well never stops me from going there, just too good!! A++\", u\"Really wish I found this place sooner.\\nVery small spot and easy to miss, but totally worth finding it.\\n\\nNever had Tibetan food before, so don't have a comparison but every single thing we ordered was great. Only way to describe this cuisine is a mix of all the things I love about Thai, Indian and Chinese cuisine.\\n\\nThe food:\\nMomo: delicious version of dumplings\\nLamb Curry: Perfectly cooked, great level of spice and flavor\\nMango Shrimp: Sweet and balanced flavors\\n\\nVery excited to go back and try the rest of the menu, and wish it can fit a bigger group so I can order more things to try in one sitting.\\n\\nNote: Believe this was cash only\", u'i like the food.  that\\'s not the problem.  the problem is that i\\'ve had \"spicy tibet\" in jackson heights and this place does not measure up.  it\\'s pretty overpriced and the momos and tingmos are not as good as spicy tibet\\'s.  but if you\\'re in the \\'hood and needing a spicy kick in the pants.  this place is a fair substitute.  just be sure to bring cashola b/c they don\\'t take cards and they don\\'t deliver and they\\'re closed from 4 - 5 pm (that gets me every time!).  :)', u'Ordered takeout from here, it took like one hour.  The food was pretty good, tastes between Indian and Chinese.\\n\\nThe fried buns were meaty and juicy in the middle, and I thoroughly enjoyed the mung bean in chili oil, it was quite spicy but an acquired taste.  \\n\\nIt was nice to try but nothing special.', u'A hole-in-the-wall with questionable cleanliness. Not sure how big the kitchen is but the food took a long time to come out.\\n\\nI liked the fried buns, but other than that, the food was of pretty bad quality, especially the meat.', u\"There are some restaurants which when you enter you get transformed into a completely different world, and Cafe Tibet is one of those.\\nTucked away in Brooklyn, it is right below the Q line, and would almost seem that it is closed or doesn't exist. When you enter,a cozy spot opens up in front of you with 5-6 tables and colorful wall art all around. It is a cash only place.\\nBeing from India  we are used to a lot of Indo-chinese food, and food which has originated from the Chinese, Tibetian areas and spread it's influence across India. What I personally love here are the momos! (they are like dumplings) My other favorite dishes are the chicken curry and the Bombay style chilli chicken. \\nI would come here again to explore the other items on the menu.\", u\"First time trying cuisine from Tibet, and what an amazing experience. I love dumplings and curry, and this place had some of the best lamb curry and fresh veggies and beef dumplings I've ever had. Juicy, succulent, and fresh ingredients. I love the steamed bun that you can dip right into the curry. Portion size was very generous and great prices too. \\nTibetan iced tea was like nothing I've had before, I think there's lemongrass in it, which gives it a unique taste that washes down some of the spice in the food. \\nThe restaurant is very narrow with less than 10 tables, but the food was amazing. I would compare it to a mix on Indian and Thai food. Highly, highly recommend. I'll be coming back for sure.\", u'Amazing!!order the shrimp curry its delightful the service is kind\\nI highly reccomend this place', u'Never disappoints. Eaten here countless times. One of my favorite neighborhood spots.\\n\\nFood is delicious, healthy, and affordable. Atmosphere is quiet and peaceful.', u'This is one of my casual restaurant that I keep coming , the restaurant is very small and tiny,  always crowed and busy with delivery. My favorite here is spicy chili pork. They are not sell wine , beer and liquor here and  I usually bring my own wine but recently they are not allow to do that, not sure what happened. This place *CASH ONLY**', u\"I've been coming to Cafe Tibet since I first discovered it about 8 years ago. I used to love this place! However, we went there yesterday (6/29/16) and quality and taste declined since our last visit about a month ago! I have no idea what happened! \\n\\nSukuti (appetizer) was on point I give them that! \\n\\nShabaklap left a lot to desire! Dough was different (bad) and flavorless. Usually these beef patties have a lot of meat with spices and broth inside the dough. Nope, not this time. They were dry. The side salad turned into basically few slices of romain with some dressing. They used to have actual little fresh salad with carrots and onions which paired fantastic with shabaklap. :( \\n\\nFriend ordered shrimp curry. She said it was super sweet this time.\\n\\nAlso, sauces they give you on the side tasted nothing like they typically do. Way too watery and way too much vinegar added.\\n\\nThis place used to be a gem... I'm quite disappointed that my favorite restaurant is turning into mediocre establishment... Quality is definitely declining.\"], u'72.Olea': [u\"Hate to be trite but this place was truly a party in my mouth where everyone was invited. My friends and I shared a number of small tapas plates including Greek potatoes, fried falafel coated artichoke hearts (good but not favorite), Brussel sprouts (a little bit sweet), and grilled halumi cheese; They were all very good with each of us had a different favorite. Shared a seafood paella and sangria steak larger tapas plates, both of which we enjoyed. The paella has an unusual black rice base and although they informed us beforehand, the delicious steak is a bit on the smaller side if you are sharing. This was a good amount of food for four people. We also shared a pitcher of the white wine mango sangria which I'd recommend to others. \\n\\nThe environment for this place is warm and cozy. I wouldn't call it baby friendly because the space is a little tight but they were extremely accommodating and made it work. Pricing is about what I'd expect for a place like this with the quality of food served. Highly recommended\", u'I can legit say that I ate at this spot every week during the summer. My good friend whose a regular there put me onto this spot & I am totally obsessed. Everything is good there from the French toast to their arugula salads. I have no complaints!  \\n\\nI came here yesterday & had their smoked salmon pasta & it was delicious. This place is a gem! The staff is amazing as well', u\"This place is mostly popular for the ambience, I think. It's on a mostly residential block and has lovely, bohemian decor with Mediterranean tiles and lots of plants. They even have a bit of sidewalk seating. \\n\\nThe food, however, is meh. Edible but unexciting, and certainly not worth these prices.\\n\\nService is amiable but sometimes very disorganized.\", u\"Olea is a bustling Mediterranean restaurant nestled into a corner of residential Fort Greene. \\n\\nThey don't take reservations so expect to wait 15-40 minutes, but it's worth it. They decor is cozy, with pillows on the benches and plates in the walls. It feels like a cafe you'd stumble into in a middle eastern market.  \\n\\nThe tapas are great - fried olives, chickpeas, and an array of dips. Go for happy hour for great deals from 4-6 on M-R. Brunch is also phenomenal. Get the Olea breakfast for an assortment of tastes - includes cilantro spiced eggs, eggplant salad, peppers salad, a yogurt dip, pita, etc. \\n\\nBest of all - outdoor seating on a nice day. Enjoy and pretend you're on a Mediterranean vacation!\", u\"Every time I come here, there's always a wait and the food is always fantastic...coincidence?\\nThis is a classic Brooklyn Mediterranean spot and it really doesn't disappoint.  The flavors are always fresh, interesting and well blended.\\nCome here with a friend or SO, order a bottle of wine and relax.\\nFYI portions here are average to small, so don't depend on appetizers (like I sometimes do) to fill you up.\", u'I have to say that basically anything we have ordered at Olea is great.  This place gets crowded but we were super lucky to get in quickly, although it is worth the wait.  Love the tapas, from the corn salad, to the brussel sprouts, to the fish fingers and the split pea soup, love them all.  Also, the salads are great too, and the gambas, is always a favorite. Dont forget the harisa deviled eggs, which are so good.  I was really sad that there was no more little chocolate that came with the bill, it was something I always looked forward too.  What happened to the chocolates?', u\"I love this place! The atmosphere is cozy and colorful - makes you want to stay and take your time. But the real reason is, of course, the food. \\n\\nOMG is it good. This is one of my favorite brunch places in all our Brooklyn. The Olea Brunch is a classic plate, perfect for vegetarians. Eggs are organic and the drinks are delicious. \\n\\nOne of the reasons I like Olea so much is that they have a good balance of savory and sweet breakfast options, including a savory French toast! Flavors are in harmony and tastes are balanced on just about every plate I've tried. \\n\\nLately I'm digging the lamb hash (who knew?!) and the polenta, but they also have an ever changing menu of brunch specials so go with an open mind and a hungry palate and enjoy!\", u'Ate here for dinner. We decided to sit at the bar because there was a 30-40 min wait even though it was Sunday night. They had mango sangria and regular sangria both great. The Bronzino was really good and came with a lot of greens, great big complete meal. The orrichette with sausage and broccoli rabe was great too. The decor and atmosphere make you feel at home but also like your on vacation.', u\"Ok we're here in Fort Greene and have been told this place is great!   We in out of the cold and the place is packed.  But the wait is just 5 minutes because someone has just fortunately cancelled!\\nWe're seated in a sunny window table.  This place is cozy and very hip. A really cool vibe a millennial stronghold with beautiful people!  I'm the only baby boomer in the place.  No one above the age of 35. \\nThe waiter comes right over and I ask for prosecco, but cava is what they have so cava it is!!\\nI order some scrambled  eggs and my son has ordered the Spanish omelette. \\nWe're starving.  Ok the food has arrived and we are eating like animals \\nThis is a great spot and highly recommend it!!\", u\"Happy hour review- \\n\\nThe restaurant is small but the interior designs' awesome. The happy hour menu had amazing prices to tapas and drinks, ranging from $2-$8. \\n\\nMy cousin ordered fried fish, pickled cauliflower, pizza, and pita with 3 different types of hummus. Every dish was delicious in its own unique way. \\n\\nMy favorites were the fish and pita/hummus. Fried fish was crispy and not greasy at all. Had a great dipping sauce. The pita bread was soft and chewy- the hummus were so good. \\n\\nThe cauliflower and the pizza were a bit sour but still tasted great. Great consistency all around with the tapas. The wine was yummy too. \\n\\nService was friendly and fast. I am a fan of its happy hour for sure so I will definitely be back!\", u'One of my favorite brunch places in NYC. When I first walked into Olea, I right away loved the ambiance. It looks like a cozy little cottage with really cute tiles around the counters as well as a cool collection of plants. They have some bench seating by the window with a bunch of colorful pillows and cushions which I loved. \\n\\nNow for the food. OH MY GOSH. SO GOOD. I came here for brunch and I loved everything I ate.  For an appetizer, I ordered the grilled pita with three different dips. I got the roasted beet skordalia, romesco, and the spicy feta. The roasted beet skordalia blew my mind. If you like beets, you will definitely love this dip. The romesco was also amazing. The spicy feta dip was good but not as good as the roasted beet or romesco. For my main dish, I got the lamb hash which put me in awe. The hash had amazing flavor to it and the lamb had the perfect texture. One of my friends ordered the Greek French toast which was one of their specials that day. It was French toast with Greek yogurt, honey, and pomegranate seeds and it was amazing. It was a good change from the usual solely sweet sort of French toast. \\n\\nThe drinks are also spot on. They make a really good bloody mary and I also got a pomegranate lemonade with vodka which was one of their specials that day and it was awesome.\\n\\nAs for the wait, I went at noon on a Saturday. I was told the wait would be one hour for a table of three, but a lot of people who were on the list before me ended up leaving so I only had to wait 20 minutes so I got lucky. Olea would definitely be worth the hour wait though. I still think about Olea on an almost daily basis and cannot wait to come back.', u'Olea has never let me down. It\\'s perfect for a quick drink moment or a leisurely meal moment and I\\'ve been a customer since it opened so I\\'ve had plenty of both. I remember the days they used to serve oysters with tears in my eyes because who doesn\\'t need a priced-right, super fresh oyster happy hour just a few blocks from home? #Memories. \\n\\nSpeaking of happy hours, Olea\\'s currently runs Monday-Thursday, 4p-6p. In days of yore it ran through Fridays and the hours were 4p-7p. It felt like a Brooklyn-version of Barcelona, guys: tons of tapas and tasty adult bevies that wouldn\\'t break your wallet; neighborhood customers kitted out casually or in their Brooklyn-sexy design firm/art school/pr professional/author/film star/investment banker best. Sort of like Almovodar\\'s \"Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown\". But without the serious, mind-bending drug use. Or murder and metal wellness issues.  #Heydays\\n\\nFlash forward to now: although the happy hour tapas has gone up a dollar or two over the years, the menu is still affordable and the drinks\\' price increase is equally modest. Guys, one can still get one\\'s groove on here and make that mortgage payment, not to worry! It makes business sense to shorten happy hour traffic as extended hours put a dent in dinner margins because the entire restaurant gets taken over by happy hour folks who order up a storm and just chill through the night. I mean, I know you know but tapas (even hot tapas) is great at room temperature. Full disclosure: I often did this. Like order the entire happy hour menu for \"dinner\" and split it with old friends at one of Olea\\'s indoor tables, or pretty outside cafe-style seating or newly made buds, at the bar.  #PersonalFinance\\n\\nWhilst the happy hour menu holds solid, I often eat from the daily \"specials\" menu. Here you will find seasonal offerings, some of which are farm-to-table like a pea shoot, minted-barley salad, with pancetta (or without, vegan and veg friends!) glistening with a delirium-inducing tahini (V) or yogurt-based dressing (VG). I often order the chicken empanadillas made with Goffre Farms chix thighs, eggplant and whatever hard cheese they\\'re featuring that given day with harissa (from scratch!), even though the yogurt sauce this dish is served with is lovely. Sometimes they have Manilla clams in sherry for a special app. I get those, aways. Seriously: do it. Thank me quietly in your heart.  #411\\n\\nSummer time favs from the regular menu include their signature salad as it has every single summer vegetable grown in the State of New York. And when I\\'m feeling sad, I\\'ll get the 4-season-emotionally-appropriate orchiette with broccoli rapini, sausage and blistered tiny tomatoes. \\n\\nIf your shit has really hit the fan or maybe you closed a sick deal, I recommend their steak. For that ***red meat moment***. Rest assured that the kitchen understands what rare or medium rare means. BTW: fries lovers pay attention because the steak comes with an abundant quantity of beautifully rendered fries, sized in between shoestring and regular. I generally opt out and ask for arugula on the side because you guys, I\\'m already stoking a future heart attack with that meat.  #Facts\\n\\nSometimes, one needs to go out in order to feel at home. Olea is the spot that will help you get there. I\\'ll continue to go until I leave our glistening metropolis.  #Trust', u\"This place wowed me. Charming ambiance, professional but not over-friendly wait staff, and scrumptious food! One of the best brunches I've had in BK. We had the Spanish Poutine special, which was delectably spiced and the fries were perfectly crisp. I can't recall whether it had pork or beef in it, but it was top-notch. We also got the lamb shoulder hash- outstanding and bursting with flavor. Portions were generous which made them decent value for the $19 price tag. The whole place is done right. Can't recommend it enough.\", u'Delicious Food that\\'s Worth the Wait\\nThis a a tiny place that typically has a wait. We had a 90 minute wait and we arrived at 8:00pm. We started with the Almond-Stuffed Bacon Wrapped Dates. The bacon was very crispy. This was the perfect blend of salty and sweet. We also ordered the Flash-Fried Brussels Sprouts (honey, lemon, crushed red pepper) as a tapa. The sprouts were so flavorful and had a nice crunch. The arugula salad was served with pears and Goat Cheese Croquettes (herbs, crushed red pepper, with honey). I am not particularly fond of goat cheese; however having it fried and tamed with the honey took the \"barn\" taste right out of it. For my entree I had Sauteed Shrimp - five large shrimp sauteed in the Greek style (garlic, tomato sauce, feta, parsley, oregano, ouzo). There are 2 other styles of prep for the shrimp. I did order a side of olive mashed potatoes. They were a bit dry. I would opt for a different side next time.', u'As a disclaimer, I would say that I generally do not like mediterranean food because I think it\\'s usually bland like [insert food item] and lemon.  However, Olea changed that for me.\\n\\nWhen I walked into Olea, you could already smell what was on everyone\\'s plate.  That really got my stomach going!  However, there was a 20 minute wait for a table for two on a Thursday.  That was kind of a bummer since it was cold and there isn\\'t a great place to wait.  My friend and I were stuck by the entrance which is also where the hostess hangs out and pretty much all up in the bar.  So that was pretty awkward since I could basically write the hostess\\' notes for her.\\n\\nBy the time the wait was over, I was ready to go!  My friend is vegetarian and usually orders appetizers and sides when he comes here.  I was skeptical about the sizing and flavors of the appetizers and sides, so I opted to get the chicken dish.  Once his appetizers came out, I was staring at them like a maniac, so we ended up sharing.  We ordered, the Spanish Pitza (which I wasn\\'t too crazy about), the goat cheese croquettes (good as heck!), patatas bravas (classicly delicious), chickpeas and brussel sprouts.  Since I\\'m sure they were all relatively simple to cook, they came out before my chicken.  As I was eating them, I was like, \"Ugh!  I have to eat chicken later?!\" \\n\\nBy the time my chicken came, I wanted to pretend I didn\\'t know what it was!  I was way too full to eat it, so I basically tasted it and took it to go.  (It\\'s no longer on the menu and I probably won\\'t order it again, so good riddance!)\\n\\nI definitely need to come back for happy hour for some heavenly tapas!', u\"This place is ssooo good, and the prices are very reasonable. We sat at the bar and got glasses of the Lambrusco, which was perfect for a hot, summer evening. Then we got the pita and hummus which was substantial and very tasty! The best that I've had in brooklyn for sure. We also got a summer corn salad that was ssssoooo delicious, and sort of reminded me of elote. \\n\\nAll around this place was just sooo good, and the staff was very pleasant. Service was efficient and appropriately timed. \\n\\nStrongly recommend!!\", u\"So much yes. Adorable restaurant. Friendly service and they let you customize your dishes. I really appreciate that. Delicious food. Like, really, super delicious. Only prob is the long ass wait for brunch but I'm willing to overlook that.\\n\\nFavorite things: warm melt in your mouth chocolate croissants and the bacon wrapped dates with goat cheese and almonds. oh my. oh my indeed.\", u\"Came here for dinner, it was PACKED! We didn't have reservations, we were just walking around and looking for a dinner spot and this place looked good. The food was so good here, but the service was a litttttle slow. Just a little bit. We also kind of messed up by first saying that we wanted to have a table indoors, but then we decided last minute that we wanted a table outdoors. It was a cute little table but it took forever to prepare. Granted, there were people sitting at every outdoor table but they kept telling us that we could sit down soon, and we ended up sitting at the bar for like 25 min drinking our wine. They gave a nice hefty bit of wine tho. So that was good. The food was so good!\", u\"The place is cute (cozy and relaxing), and was packed on a weekday (around mid day). I took my mother out for brunch the day after mother's day, so maybe some other folks had the same idea? We got appetizers (my mom, fries, and me, croquettes), basically, chicken and goat? empanadas (although they were named something else) and a honey drink. \\n\\nWhile the food was okay, unfortunately the service was lacking. The guy who brought of my mother's fries didn't bring any ketchup or offer her anything. Just plopped them down and ran off. When our server came over and we asked for the ketchup she said she'd get it and then passed our table multiple times with nothing - so I had to get up and get it for my mother. \\n\\nNo checking in or appearance of friendliness from this server. It just makes me wonder why such people don't quit if they don't like their jobs very much. Anyways, we probably wouldn't return. Not terrible, but definitely overhyped.\", u\"This place is so cute and quaint! I really like their bathroom and the overall ambiance. \\n\\nThe waitstaff were really kind and patient. They kept giving me more bread for my soup which I liked because I love bread lol.\\n\\nMe and friend came for a late lunch and I had the soup of the day which was a lamb stew. I didn't really like the gamey smell. My friend enjoyed her chicken sandwich.\\n\\nWe'll probably come back for brunch because that seems to be the reason everyone comes here!\"], u'61.Fob Brooklyn': [u\"I went for brunch. I had the picadillo dish. It was amazing. My wife's sausage with vinegar was also incredible.\\n\\nAlso, our umbrella broke, so they lent us one!\\n\\nI will definitely be back.\", u\"Came here one Sunday afternoon - don't get fooled, people sit in the back garden when it's nice.\\n\\nIt's a pretty nice restaurant, with nice servicer and good food, but they were surprisingly out of/low on a number of dishes we ordered.  Oh well.\\n\\nThe silogs are pretty good. The longanisa is good, with a consistency like chorizo. The sliced pork is tender and flavorful. \\n\\nTasty!\", u\"Came here with a few friends for dinner. They have outdoor seating in the back, which I recommend on a beautiful night. It was pretty hot indoors, so if it's a warm summer night, I highly recommend sitting outside if you can.\\n\\nThe decor is simple, yet fits the vibe of the restaurant. There was 4 of us in the party, and we shared a few entrees and appetizers.\\n\\nAppetizers:\\n- Peel & Eat 7up Shrimp - very flavorful, but $12 for 4 pieces is bit steep.\\n- Jicama salad - delicious salad, highly recommend\\n- Sisig - very flavorfull and definitely worth the value. Has a nice kick to it and perfect for sharing.\\n- Spicy Chicken Langkawas - wasn't too spicy, but it didn't really blow me away. Very simple wings appetizer.\\n\\nEntrees:\\n- Filipino BBQ - you get 2 skewers, which I opted for one each of Chicken and Pork. The pork is definitely a lot better.\\n- Seafood Malabon - the seafood itself is a bit lacking, but very flavorful. Can't say it was my favorite dish, but if you want a simple noodle dish, this is the one for you.\\n- Sizzling Bulalo - slow braised beef shank. The meat literally fell off the bones. Definitely order a side of garlic rice to go with this.\\n\\nOverall, the food was amazing. I would go back and try some of the other options. It's also BYOB!\", u\"I love the cozy, rustic, American-Filipino vibe decor of this place. Hubby and I ordered 4 entrees since everything just looked good and we just wanted to try it all! I had the Seafood Malabon noodles and Sizzling Bulalo. He got his Chicken Adobo Southern style, which had coconut milk and chili, and BBQ skewers (1 chicken and 1 pork bbq skewer). The chicken adobo southern style was our fave. The spice wasn't too spicy that we were grabbing for our Zesto Dalandan and Calamansi sodas, which were refreshing. \\nEverything definitely satisfied our Filipino food craving. I can't wait to go back and try out the rest of the menu and have some more of that chicken adobo. For dessert, I loved the flan. Though I ordered the Chocnut cake, which was ok.\", u\"I love FOB Brooklyn from inside and out, the ambiance gives a very refreshing vibe, especially in the summer.\\n\\nWe came here one Sunday afternoon for Brunch, we always walk passed it, promising ourselves that we will dine here one day and one Sunday was that day. The French door was widely open overlooking the staff counter, the kitchen and the spacious backyard with diners. The staff are very enthusiastic explaining to us where the wall portraits are taken from in Manila. We opted to be seated at the front door, It was BYOB so I ran very quickly to grab some beer while we waited for our orders.\\n\\nThe brunch menu is so easy to navigate and uncomplicated, I ordered Longganisa (Filipino sausage) served with garlic fried rice, fried egg with green salad while my spouse chose Beef Tapa also served with garlic fried rice and fried egg with green salad. it was freshly made and filling, so great value. \\n\\nOur waiter told us we should comeback and try the dinner menu comprising of more traditional Filipino dishes, and we'll probably do so soon!\", u\"Filipino food is one of the cuisines that I'm not super well versed in, but I'm always up for learning more!\\n\\nFob is kind of also fusion and BBQ, so tons of options.\\n\\nThey have tuna poke, in a sweet mango salad. That was really delicious.\\n\\nAlso had the sizzling sisig, which had crunchy pig parts. Just the right amount of unhealthy.\\n\\nI went with the overnight chicken adobo as my main, and it was yum. The sauce was on the saltier side, but the flavors were all there and the chicken was so juicy.\\n\\nI also tried the roasted tupa (sliced lamb with spicy coconut dipping sauce). Very good too.\\n\\nThe best deal is to get two sides for $5 when you order an entree.The sausage and green beans was my favorite of the ones we had.\\n\\nThe decor is clean and awesome, and I loved the food and travel books they had on the shelves.\\n\\nOnly real complaint was how gigantic the chairs closest to the service aisle were. Got bumped into by multiple people throughout my meal.\\n\\nOur waitress also told us Yelp is the worst thing to ever happen to the world, so...\\n\\nNo alcohol, so BYOB!\", u'The phrase, \"greater than the sum of its parts,\" was made for this place. \\'Cause even though half my meal was flawed in some way, I enjoyed dining here overall:\\n\\nAbout those aforementioned flaws, well, the Jicama & Pomelo Salad tasted PREDOMINANTLY of fish sauce.  And the \\'Tuna Kilawin\\' with Taro Chips, which seemed similar to a ceviche with coconut milk to me, was just plain bland and boring. Grilled Tupa, aka Sliced Lamb, came with a tasty spicy coconut milk dipping sauce.  But the meat itself was a bit overcooked and under seasoned.  Not worth $19, especially since, like with all the entrees here, no sides were included. \\n\\nBUT, the Chicken Adobo was tender, flavorful, and all-around delicious.  Hubby ordered this and I experienced some serious dish envy after I tasted it.  If you\\'re a fan of warm, sweet cornbread, order the Corn Bibinka.  Trust me.  And if you don\\'t mind getting messy, the Peel \\'n Eat 7-UP Shrimp are a good pick.  Though be warned, $12 gets you only four, albeit large Shrimp.  Friend who was dining with us got the Filipino BBQ Chicken and offered me a taste. Enjoyable if you\\'re good with spending $14 for just two Skewers of meat.\\n\\nAs I alluded to above, sides are extra; $3.50 for one or $5.00 for two.  The Kale with Coconut Milk was a standout for me.  \\n\\nCouldn\\'t resist trying Halo Halo for dessert.  Loved the colorful presentation, featuring scoops of vivid purple ube ice cream.  But our server mixed everything together table side and it all melted pretty quickly into soup after that. It was fun and refreshing to eat a few bites and mercifully, it wasn\\'t overly sweet, but the novelty wore off pretty quickly.  Also tried Biko, aka Coconut Sticky Rice with Caramel. This one was too sweet for me, though my friend loved it so I guess it\\'s all relative.\\n\\nReally liked the light, airy feel of the dining room, not to mention our engaging, blonde-pixied, Cara Delevingne-channeling-server, who was impressively patient, humoring not only hubby but my friend\\'s spouse.  Not sure whose jokes were cornier. \\n\\nDon\\'t know how long it will last, but on our visit, this spot was BYOB.  We put away two bottles of Rose, purchased from nearby Smith & Vine.  Hmm...  Come to think of it, maybe that\\'s why I\\'m so eager to return, in spite of the up and down food.:)', u\"Was attracted by the nice brunch pictures on yelp from Fob Brooklyn, but unfortunately we could only come for dinner. There was no wait around 6:30 PM, and we were able to score seats near the window with that good lighting for food pics ;) The decor was so unique. It had a tropical feel with a modern twist. \\n\\nBetween the four of us, we ordered four entrees and four sides. They have a deal of 2 sides for $5 if you order an entree as well. We ordered the bistek, overnight chicken adobo, cebu roast chicken, and seafood malabon. \\n\\n\\nENTREES \\nThe seafood malabon - consisted of glass noodles with pieces of shrimp and mussels?? with a side of egg and lemon. The lemon definitely brought out the flavor in the dish and it tastes very authentic. \\n\\nThe overnight chicken adobo - VERY VERY tender. It was paired nicely with the sauce that it came with. Probably my favorite dish of the night. \\n\\nBistek - steak in a small skillet. The steak sauce was very flavorful. The only downside to this dish was it was a little too well done, making it a little too chewy. \\n\\nRoast chicken - I didn't try this dish but it looked a little dry. My friend couldn't get the meat off the bones with his fork and knife, he had to use his hands. \\n\\nSIDES \\nGarlic rice - WOULD RECOMMEND! Just the right amount of garlic. Some other restaurants overpower it with too much garlic but fob made it just right. \\n\\nOverall the quality of the food was amazing and as authentic as it can get. Brought down a star for the amount of time it took for the food to arrive. There were two other tables who were seated after us who got their entrees before we received anything.\", u\"Came here for brunch with two friends.  First of all, the restaurant itself is super cute and charming.  The space and decor felt so warm and inviting.  We decided to try three of the silogs dishes, including tocino, longanisa and tapa.  All three dishes came with garlic rice and a perfectly fried egg. I personally loved all three meats and cleaned my dish.  My Filipino friend was a bit more critical, particularly about the tapa.  \\n\\nWe also ordered a Halo Halo Waffle to try.  It was beautiful and looked just like the shaved ice version, except with a waffle in place of the ice.  I loved the toppings, but thought the waffle was a bit overcooked.  \\n\\nService was amazing, my coffee and water cup never dipped below halfway.  Moreover, the coffee was absolutely delicious, given the constant refill, I've must've had at least 2-3 cups.  I was definitely a ball of energy at the end of the meal.  \\n\\nOverall, I was really happy with our entrees and would love to come back here again to try the dinner menu.\", u\"Took the F train to Brooklyn from Manhattan, just to dine at FOB.\\nThe station lets out only a minute's walk from the restaurant- no excuses for the Manhattan crowd to miss this delectable gem.\\nI'm very familiar with Chef Armando, having patronized his restaurants when he was in Miami.\\nI was very excited to see what he had up his sleeve for his own venue.\\nI was not disappointed and overwhelmingly happy with the family-oriented decor, attentive service and phenomenal food.\\nThis is an out-of-the-park grand slam home run!!!\\n\\nThe glass wall facade invites you in. \\nI was immediately greeted by the staff and Chef Armando and his partner/GM, Ahmet.\\nThe interior is warmly set for a peaceful culinary experience with large, colorful images of the Philippines and the owners' family and friends.\\nIt's almost like going back to the chef's family-home dining room in the Philippines.\\n\\nThe menu is unambiguous, with brief and clear explanations of the dishes and their contents.\\nNames of dishes reference the history of their concoction.\\nWe tried several items to start, with particular emphasis on the large 7-up shrimp which are addictive.\\nThe shrimp are ideally prepared with a combination of seasonings that I enjoyed licking off my fingers. \\nThe Jicama and Pomelo salad is fresh and deliciously light.\\nThe Malabon dinner entree of seafood and noodles was a perfect combination of flavors.\\nMy only criticism is that I wanted more, more, MORE!\\nThat's is NOT to say the dishes were small, but that with each bite, I wanted more of the uniquely composed tastiness that Chef has created. \\nString beans gently saut\\xe9ed with sweet sausage were fresh, crunchy and equally compelling bites with complimentary hints of seasoned pork. \\n\\nPaired with my meal was a fabulous strawberry shake with lemongrass and tapioca pearls.\\nBetween the gentle sweetness, savory subtlety and original textures, it's a necessary part of the entire meal.\\n\\nThe menu is derived from Chef's experiences growing up in his family kitchen. \\nAs a direct result, it requires no imagination to recognize the love and passion that the flavors are developed and food prepared. \\n\\nI will be back again for more of the signature BBQ, especially this summer when Chef hosts a traditional boodle fight.\", u'This is the best Filipino food in NYC. Authentic flavors, quality ingredients, attentive service.', u\"This is a review of the even by Tasting Collective that we attended. It was a 8-course brunch, created especially for this event.  I was very excited for this event, as I have never had Philippines cuisine before, especially an authentic kinds!!! Here at F.O.B., Philippines-born chef offers the dishes cooked at home on a Sunday afternoon, shared among family.\\n\\nThe restaurant decor was all about warmth. Chefs told us that photos on the walls are of places that people enjoy doing BBQ, such as at the beach. But what I liked the most were the personal touches, such as family photos, mostly old, black and white photos, which were just adorable!  The inside is not very large, but cozy and welcoming. They have simple furniture that reminds me of dining room furniture from a warm home. It was like walking into someone's home, I really liked the atmosphere.\\n\\nAt this event, we were offered: Corn Bibingka, Sisig, Champorado with Danggit, Talong, Picadillo, Tochino, Longanisa, and Halo Halo. We also got the side of Garlic Rice and Fried Egg. Everything was very tasty, interesting, comforting and delicious. \\n\\nOur waitress was really nice, friendly and attentive. I didn't get her name, but she was great, and again, very skilled at mixing our Halo Halo for us! The chef had great personality, and I really like that he only serves what he enjoy eating. They opened just a couple of months ago, I am sure this warm, friendly restaurant will stay for a long time with great, tasty, authentic delicious food! Thank you Tasting Collective for having this great event at F.O.B.! Read my full review of this restaurant and food on my food blog, foodlovergirl.\", u'This place is cozy and quaint, meant more for date nights than family nights. I had dinner here with my hubby with our 4 year old and my first thought was \"uh oh not kid friendly\". No plastic cups to replace glass and no crayons to entertain the kiddos so parents be warned if your kid needs distractions and likes to roam.\\n\\nLet\\'s talk about food:\\nThe food was surprisingly good and the plates are small so you do get to sample quite a bit of food depending on your appetite.\\npeel & eat shrimp - 4 tiger shrimp with heads on and the butter and garlic sauce is finger licking good.\\n\\nJicama & pomelo salad - my fav! Refreshing and tasty and don\\'t worry it\\'s not bitter. Pomelo is the sweeter cousin to grapefruits so has a great flavor without being sour or bitter. \\n\\nBola Bola dumplings- this was just ok in my opinion. Nothing special and I would say skip this and try another dish.\\n\\nSisig - this was pretty epic. Don\\'t read the description especially if you\\'re the type to be put off by what hot dogs are made from. Definitely try it.\\n\\nPork skewer BBQ - tender and juicy with a kick to it \\n\\nGrilled spare ribs - very delicious and on the sweet side. Meat was fall off the bone and yet juicy. Try it.\\n\\nUbe shake (taro with coconut)- delicious and medium sweetness. My daughter loved it.\\n\\nSago shake (palm sugar slush) - way too sweet for my taste but my sweet tooth hubby loved it.\\n\\nOverall thoughts:\\nThe staff seem friendly but service is a tad slow. But that\\'s just the mom brain trying to eat as quickly as possible with a kid in tow. Definitely better for groups of friends eating and lounging with time to spare.', u'My friends and I were excited to hear there was a Filipino restaurant in the neighborhood. FOB is a very casual atmosphere, a place for friends to meet up and grab some food and enjoy. The restaurant sports some of the traditional dishes - chicken adobo, chicken inasal, bulalo, sisig, etc- with a twist. We enjoyed ordering several dishes to share and liked the following: \\n\\n- corn bibingka \\n- bola- bola dumplings \\n- grilled chicken inasal   \\n- filipino bbq (pork) \\n- liempo- grilled porkbelly   \\n- fish inihaw    \\n\\nAlso, BYOB (music to my ears!). No AC.', u'Beautiful eatery; the turquoise paint and gold accents plus decorative pieces really set this restaurant apart from the rest. It\\'s an airy establishment with warm wait staff and one thing I absolutely love is their choice of chairs, they are wide-seated for the plump and they have tall backs for those who are 5\\'2\"+\\n\\nFolks at the table next to ours asked if this is a typical Filipino meal. We told them we don\\'t know since we aren\\'t Filipino therefore their assumption is as good as mine. I\\'ve heard the food here is more catered to Americans, and although I\\'ve never had Filipino food before I guess I can understand where that comment derives from. It\\'s not the wildly meat-heavy plates you normally encounter at a traditional pinoy place, but then again it\\'s on Smith street so mounds of meat don\\'t make much of a splash. \\n\\nGo early to make sure your items are available. Place ran out of my drink and ran out of a certain rice dish for another guest.', u\"I was looking for nice dinner place around Cobble Hill area and stumbled upon this new Filipino spot.  After reading the reviews and looking at the pictures, I was excited to try out this new place!  I made a reservation for 8 people for 8:00 PM on a Saturday and they gladly took us in.  My party was a 5 mins late but they sat us immediately when we got there.  The experience was okay and we thought the food was a bit mediocre.  I'll list a couple items our group ordered:\\n\\nUbe Shake / Mango Shake ($6.50): the shakes were good but definitely overpriced!  Even a regular bubble tea costs around $4-$5.  I personally did not think this was worth it.\\n\\nTuna Kilawin ($12.00): ceviche of mango, tomato, red onion, coconut milk and taro chips.  We LOVED this appetizer!  It was unique and it tasted super fresh.  The taro chips were such a great complement to the ceviche.  Highly recommend!\\n\\nSisig ($10.00): sizzling pork belly, ears, cheeks, chicharron, jalapeno.  This appetizer was ok.  I had high expectations since I tried sisig at other filipino places and they were GOOD.  This one was a bit plain for me.  I do like how they top it off with crushed pork rinds though!\\n\\nGrilled Spare Ribs ($16.00): slow braised ribs in san miguel beer, homemade banana bbq sauce.  My friend ordered this and she said it was good but not great.  It is slightly better than spare ribs you will find in a Chinese restaurant.\\n\\nLiempo-Grilled Pork Belly ($14.00):  succulent berkshire porkbelly with spicy cane vinegar dip.  I had pretty authentic pork belly from many other filipino restaurants before and this one is by far the worst I have ever had...  The pork belly is supposed to be somewhat fatty but this one is not.  It looks more like the grilled pork you get from a Viet restaurant!  I was definitely disappointed and needless to say... did not finish this.\\n\\nI also want to mention that all entrees DO NOT come with a side (meaning rice).  You have to order that separately and it is a whooping $3.00 on top of what your entree is! \\n\\nService here is typically slow.  We placed our order around 8:30 PM and did not even get our SHAKES/APPETIZERS until 9:00 PM.  Entrees came shortly after...  Our waitress was a bit slow too... I did not see the sense of urgency an employee should have working in a restaurant setting.  She was on her phone a lot so of course she couldn't see me waving the bill at her... THREE TIMES!\\n\\nOne more thing I was a bit upset about - there are items on their menu that are no longer available... I wanted to order the mussels for appetizers but they don't make that dish anymore.  Please take off any items off the menu if you no longer make them!\", u\"Stumbled upon this gem on a Sunday afternoon. The front was empty which was confusing but turns out everyone was seated in the backyard patio which was absolutely beautiful! \\n\\n1) Food was tasty and well cooked. I've never had Filipino food at a restaurant before and it surpassed my expectations. My partner and I got the ToSilog, a sweet pork dish with garlic rice. It was served with a sauce for dipping the meat and a tomato/cucumber salad. It was so filling and refreshing. We also had a Mama's French Toast which is soaked in condensed milk and perfectly sweet yet not too sweet. Last we shared a Sago drink which had yummy layers of jelly. \\n\\n2) Service was excellent. Our waitress was attentive (but not overly attentive like making awkward small talk) she didn't mind coming back twice to give us time to decide and gave recommendations too. Didn't notice our water glasses getting empty as someone kept coming around (it was a hot day so we were definitely drinking a lot of water) \\n\\n3) Ambiance: The patio was shaded and had very large tables with a nice amount of space between them. You were close to people but far enough not to hear someone's conversation. There were many large potted plants along the back and little ones in birdcages along the wall. The outdoor carpet made it feel comforting and homey. The indoor seating also look very nice and the kitchen was open enough to get a good peak at what's going on which proudly says how clean everything is. \\n\\nCan't wait to come back!\", u\"High quality Filipino restaurant with nice ambience at fair price. Filipino food is usually super super heavy but Fob managed to make it lighter and balanced while retaining the flavor. The place is not huge (probably for 20-30 people). The vibe is really nice with European garden decor as well as photography of Philippines  in and good for casual intimate dinner and service Highly recommend it!\\n\\n[Appetizer]\\n\\n7 up shrimp - The shrimps were REALLY big and very very delicious. The broth was a little bit sweet and I could taste the little hint of 7 up but was really tasty.\\n\\n[Main Dishes]\\n\\nChicken adobo - Slow cooked chicken overnight and was really tender and flavorful. Pretty salty and soy saucy but delicious. The portion was really big - three pieces of chicken thigh.\\n\\nPork belly - really tasty pork belly that has perfect combination of lean and fatty part. It tasted almost like Vietnamese food with heavy scent of lemon grass. Portion was big as well - it came with three to four big pieces of roasted pork belly.\\n\\n[Sides] \\n\\nSides were the truly amazing part of the entire meal. The main courses didn't come with sides so high recommend to get 1-2 sides. One side is ~$3 and two are $5 so definitely worth it.\\n\\nCoconut taro leave - braised taro leave in coconut sauce; a bit salty but really tasty; highly recommended\\n\\nChickpea with tripe - slow cooked chickpea with tripe; moderate taste and flavor is really refreshing; highly recommended\\n\\nEggplants tomato - light flavored and very refreshing; eggplant and tomato go along with eat other really well; good to balance off the heavy taste of the meatballs \\n\\nCantonese noodle - nothing special; like something you'd encounter in Chinese takeout place\\n\\n[Dessert and drink]\\n\\nSlush - you HAVE to try one of the slushes; it's kinda like those Chinese bubble teas but less sweet and more refreshing. I got cantaloupe slush and it was really refreshing. You can taste the real fruit inside.\\n\\nHalo halo - classical Filipino dessert with standard quality: taro ice cream on some slush and sweetened beans and fruit jellies. Nothing too impressive but what more can you ask for a halo halo?\", u\"Hit up this Filipino restaurant at Brooklyn. Here's my breakdown:\\n\\nFood: \\nChicken Adobo - You actually get chicken breasts which is different than traditional. Good portion size for money.\\nSisig - They serve on sizzling plate, I would recommend eating with rice.\\n\\nOverall, 4 of 5. Good portion sizes and taste. I'm biased and prefer Filipino cooking back home but overall solid food.\\n\\nService: \\nI have to say this is where they are lacking. Poor waiter accidentally gave mango smoothie when we didn't order and also accidentally gave another order of chicken adobo to-go when didn't request. Overall, 3 out of 5.\\n\\nOverall, nice Filipino restaurant to check out if you're in the area.\", u\"Literally, stop what you're doing and start heading over to Fob!! \\nMy first Filipino brunch spot and it was excellent! The meal and shakes came up to about $20 per person and it was extremely filling. The atmosphere was very cozy, especially the backyard. The waitress was a sweetheart, I should have gotten her name but I'll be back soon, for sure.\"], u'155.Palomas': [u'Come hungry because the food is amazing!! Every bite was filled with flavor and everything freshly made. My husband and I had their menu options of main courses, drinks and appetizers. We came during lunch time so we chose the main courses during lunch time-all was perfect.\\nWould like to know if they are going to create lunch menu versions of their main courses??\\nGood atmosphere with Spanish music. Excellent service!\\nStreet parking available.\\nHappy hour is $1 off drinks.', u\"We went to Palomas for dinner on Friday night, we didn't need to make reservations and there was no wait. \\n\\nThe servers were great and very attentive.\\n\\nWe both got the fajitas, I got the Tinga de Pollo which was perfect. Crystal got the shrimp fajitas which were great as well - perfectly cooked and very juicy. \\n\\nThe portion was massive. I was hungry when I arrived and generally don't leave extra food but the portion was so large that we both had to take some of our meal home. It tasted good in the morning as well.\", u\"Coming from Queens to Manhattan to take in the Billy Joel concert, we needed a place to eat that would be perfect...and like a beautiful white dove, Paloma's flew in to save the night. \\nThis charming Ecuadorian brother and sister have created a delicious Mexican bistro. The menu will not overwhelm you with too many choices. But what they do cook and serve is almost too scrumptious. \\nWe had enchiladas verde and beef fajitas. And let me tell you, the side dishes are all winners. Sticky yellow rice with re fried beans and salad, crunchy chips and pico. And great mole!\\nWe didn't get to sample the avocado fries, but next time.\", u\"Came here by chance recently. A cute place, not super packed on a Saturday night and with plenty of space between tables and good music level. We were immediately greeted with house-fried tortilla chips and some delicious salsa (not spicy though). \\n\\nWe ordered the steak nachos ($12) and chicken tostadas ($10). The steak nachos were SO good! Tons of cheese, a smear of refried beans on each chip, plenty of delicious steak pieces, and a scoop of guacamole in the middle. Exactly what you want when you want nachos! The chicken tostadas were also piled high with toppings--the lettuce was very fresh and there was plenty of cheese and chicken. I actually thought I'd prefer it with a tad less cheese and a bit more pico de gallo; it would've been nice to have a bit of acid to cut through the heaviness. Oh, and some hot sauce would've been amazing since I like a bit of spice and there wasn't any!\\n\\nThe table next to mine ordered fajitas and tacos that looked AMAZING! I want to order fajitas next time!\\n\\nAnyway, food was delicious but minus one star for the crazy slow service and lack of hot sauce. There was only one server who was doing the best he could but it was a bit hard to get his attention and the food took forever! I'd go back though, and soon!\\n\\n(Also, I left my umbrella there so if you're the business owner and the umbrella is still there, message me :) )\", u\"The guac here is pretty delicious, and a good sized portion. The avocado fries, nachos and quesadillas are good too. I'm not a hug fan of the rice and beans, they're ok. But I've noticed they're really increased their prices, and imo it isn't worth it. So I'd only go here if I can splurge\", u'This place is awesome, they give good hardy portions for a very affordable price. The food is a mixture of typical Mexican classics with a few inventive twists. To start I had avocado fries, they were delicious ripe avocados that had been breaded and fried. Those fried avocados combined with a chipotle mayo dipping sauce was purely sensational. For the main course, I ordered the carnitas tacos which were amazing, the pork was juicy and the tacos were served in a flour tortilla with a scoop of very tasty guacamole. The sides of the platter stuck to authentic Mexican as it included refried beans and yellow Spanish rice. The food was delicious here and I most certainly plan on returning!', u\"I recently had a craving for Mexican food and I am so glad I found this place! Having lived in California for several years, I have pretty high expectations for Mexican food and Palomas did not disappoint!  I had the verde carnitas enchiladas. You could tell that the rice, the tortillas and the beans were all really fresh. The carnitas had those crispy bits that are my favorite. It was a huge plate of food and I couldn't finish it all! Fernando, one of the owners is really friendly. You can tell he's happy when his customers are happy. I will definitely be back to this place again!\", u\"i got the steak burrito, i was a little confused when i saw my burrito was a square and not cylinder, but nonetheless fine. chips could be better but you can't have it all. nice staff.\", u\"Food is very average. We got the fish tacos which were not horrible but not great either. Kind of tough and dry. Another person at our table got the burrito, it was quite big, but mostly filled with rice. They gave us a half filled bowl of chips and salsa to start, it was free, but a small amount for 3 people to share, and when the bowl was finished quickly we were not offered more. \\nI have no need to return here. Mally's is tastier and cheaper.\", u'We came on a Friday night with no wait time. The service was personable and attentive. I started with the red sangria, which was delicious and quite strong. They have a great selection of Mexican beers as well. Most entrees allow you to choose the protein you want, which I love. I got the shrimp tacos that come with rice and beans and a small salad. My bf got the enchiladas verde. Oh, wow. We have definitely found our new Mexican spot. The food here is so good. It really feels like a neighborhood spot and I will definitely be back again and again.', u\"Awesome Datenight with my Love @Palomas! Where they greet you with a smile, awesome Salsa & Chips and  a huge plate of delicious food yumm.   You can purchase the special Salsa to take it home which I did & The Sangria is on point! Come check out this beautiful lil spot which makes me feel like I'm away in my island of Puerto Rico .   Our waiter/bartender Fernando was awesome and the chef is the ish too lol\", u\"Ehhhhhh I was really disappointed. The steak on my nachos was extremely salty. And my enchilada was extremely bland.  I'm confused because this place got really good reviews. Maybe just an off day. I'm not going to try this place again.\", u'My family & I found ourselves in the neighborhood due to an unfortunate death in our family. My brother saw this restaurant walking around and decided we should have dinner here. Fernando greeted us as soon as we walked in and was so very pleasant and welcoming! The food is amazing! The plates are very delicious, if you like to eat this is the place!! The plates are very full! You can easily split a plate with someone. Enjoyable!!! WILL RETURN!\\n\\nGracias Fernando! \\nAida', u'Amazing Food, even better Service. Their sangria is amazing. The nachos were great. Definitely will visit again.', u\"Score!  Brought some friends from out of town here for lunch and we were blown away.  The service was friendly and attentive, and we were steered by the server to the Red Sangria--awesome choice!  I had the Enchiladas Verdes with carnitas which were some of the best enchiladas I've had in NYC. Portions generous and prices super reasonable. I will be back!\", u\"The steak is great and the food was fresh. Tostadas were huge for $10 and the stuffed avocados were really good as well! \\n\\n Only complaint is the service and the ambiance was a little dead which didn't make me want to stay and order another drink (and i was planning on having a few) They would benefit from an actual server seems like it was the owner and like a family friend working there they need someone to liven the place up and it would be a hit! \\n\\nBut come for the food for sure! it's a cool low-key spot where no one will bother you and i mean that literally!\", u\"Loved everything. Sangria is perfect! Guacamole is so fresh. Salas and sauces are on point. \\nDef loved the enchiladas and chimichanga, queso fondito, so fun, best cheese ever. And the TACOS!! Can't wait to keep coming back here. Had a great time with the staff as well ;)\", u'Went here for dinner, and the place was very quiet for a Saturday evening as I was the only guest. No problems - that just means better service and more attention. I ordered a plate of fajitas which took a while to arrive, but definitely worth the wait. Super delicious and a huge portion which means I have lunch tomorrow as well. \\n\\nThe young waiter was attentive and very friendly. Was recommended the beef burrito next time. Will make sure to try it out!', u'Was here over the weekend and food was delicious, very fresh ingredients. I had chicken, shrimp, beef and fish tacos and they were ALL GOOD :P. Guacamole was very good. Sangria was really good, not sweet at all. Just perfect for the taste!... The staff goes above and beyond. Good attention and Service. The restaurant is clean. Overall, the quality of the food is very good and I would deff recommend this restaurant. Will be visiting again for sure! :)', u\"This restaurant is very small and quiet like most restaurants in Ridgewood/Bushwick. At night, it was too dark inside and there were no candles on the tables, so I could barely read the menu. I ended up using the flashlight on my phone at times. I ordered nachos as appetizer and chicken burrito for my entree. The nachos were pretty good. The burrito was big and yummy. It had grilled chicken,yellow rice, guacamole, pinto beans, cheese, and pico de gallo inside of it, topped with sour cream. I requested a side of extra sour cream to eat with the burrito.  My friend ordered pork fajitas with a side of rice beans. The pork was very tender and delicious. I'll definitely be coming back here - most likely for lunch to get better lighting lol\"], u'208.Wurst Case': [u'This was the best and absolutely most original k\\xe4sekrainer I have ever tasted outside Vienna \\nThe guys are super nice and gave me a free sampler of the Currywurst which will def be the next sausage I have there \\nBRAVO WURST-CASE TEAM and thanks for bringing a little bit of vienna to New York City !!\\nWe will be back for more \\nI did not even mention the design which by itself is worth the trip to the truck !!', u'Walked past by this adorable food \"truck\" (more like a car/cart) twice and decided to try it when we walked by a third time. \\n\\nHot dogs/wursts aren\\'t one of my favorite or go-to foods so I wasn\\'t really expecting much. But I sure did enjoy my meal here!\\n\\nTheir menu consists of around 5 options and you get a thin slice of bread with it, as well as accompany condiments. I got the #1 kasekrainer which was a pork sausage with cheese inside of it. I was given a small pickle, a banana pepper, some mustard and ketchup. The sausage itself was good, but then again I\\'m not sure if I\\'ve ever had a bad one. They grilled it to the point where there\\'s slight grill marks ensuring the insides are juicy and soft. My favorite part was the mustard. It had a kick that\\'s similar to the taste of wasabi and what it does to your nose. I like spreading that on my bread and biting it along with a piece of sausage. My friends ordered their curry wurst and it was interesting. Wasn\\'t bad, but I just prefer curry over a bed of rice than sausage. \\n\\nOverall not a bad place. It fits the Williamsburg vibe really well. Would probably be an awesome place to grab late night food!', u'A Blow from Europe , a real meal , great atmosphere , love the sausage \\nA place to go for me eat and relax .....Great bar as well....'], u'133.Lumiere Du Soleil Bakery & Cafe': [u\"Way better than the average Chinese Bakery and below that of Paris Bakery.  They do have many unique items, and the place is very clean.  The Matcha Mango Crumb as they call it was interesting, but the mango custard inside overpowers any matcha flavor there might be.  I probably be more interested in one without any filling at all.\\n\\nThey have a lot of matcha baked goods and I'm gonna try them all.  If they can make a creampuff close to Bibble & Sip's, I'd be there almost daily.  Well, that might be a bad thing for my health.  They do have creampuffs, but not matcha flavored.  I will try soon.\", u\"Cute bakery that mimics popular Korean bakeries such as tous les jours or paris baguette. Very bright interior, with light wooden chairs and tables, and great AC and space. When I came in, there was 1 worker who answered all my questions about the pastries in the display case since they all didn't have labels. \\n\\nI opted for the taro bun, that looks like a pineapple bun, and was surprised to bite into taro paste in the middle. Although it was appealing to the eye, taste was okay and you can certainly taste the flavor, but it's missing the crunch and sweetness on the upper crusty layer. I also ordered an iced coffee which wasn't strong enough and they didn't have simple syrup - only fructose.\\n\\nMajor plus is that they accept card without charging you extra tax, dont use lard, and I saw a professional espresso machine, so maybe their hot coffee will be better!\", u\"Hallelujah, all the social media photos you've seen of drool-worthy charcoal croissants out in Vancouver/Toronto and Asia have finally landed in NYC... Bensonhurst, Brooklyn to be more precise. I wasn't searching for these but as an avid supporter of the 'Hot & New' section on Yelp, I was doing a routine bookmarking session (as I frequent Bensonhurst on a daily basis) and stumbled upon Lumiere du Soleil.\\n\\nThey don't produce a ton of bun, pastry, and cake varieties but they do have a solid selection of it. It's quality over quantity right? There are cake slices, swiss rolls, breads, drinks, and kawaii-decorated cakes for birthdays like Doraemon and Hello Kitty. They've a lot of matcha things if you're interested (like yours truly).\\n\\nCharcoal Croissant: It's a given charcoal lacks flavor and its only addition to anything is its vibrant black color. The croissant was flakey, but not overly flakey. It was buttery, but that thankfully didn't translate to a lot of butter transfer on the hands. Don't expect it to be pitch black like it photographs in Canada/Asia or that of Morgenstern's 'Black Coconut Ash'\\u4e00it's more of a stone-grey but it's still unique and the first of its kind in NY!\\n\\nMatcha Mango Custard Bun: It's like a pineapple bun, but the craqueline topping is matcha flavored and not as crumbly to the touch. The interior is just as you'd imagine it, a mango flavored custard (the mango flavor is authentic). I think I would've enjoyed it more if it was filled with the original egg custard or better yet, a matcha custard because mango takes away from the matcha topping! Though the matcha was pretty and a vibrant green, I couldn't really taste it. Nonetheless, the bun itself was soft and moist unlike other chinese bakeries in the area.\\n\\nSomething minor but something I'd still like to point out: you know when you're shopping in Hong Kong and the SAs cling on to you for their dear lives?..That happened here and it's a peeve. I know the guy meant well to slide open and close the doors etc but I needed space to comfortably browse and pick my goods vs. the overwhelming attention and over-assist.\", u'Such a cute bakery!!! Staff are very friendly and they have so many goods that are very cute and yummy. So glad this opened nearby. They baked some fresh garlic bread and asked if we wanted to try some, yum. :) I think the prices are very fair and on the lower end for these kinds of pastries, compared to other bakeries. Will be coming here frequently\\n\\nThey could use cuter chairs and seating though  just plain wooden tables, each had its own outlet. Maybe calmer music too would make this place great to do work in', u'When this place first opened walked in and out without buying anything. The prices were just too expensive even their pastry. Im not sure if they either lowered their prices since the few times I went before. \\n   After reading the reviews thought I would drop by again. I was amazed to actually see the pastry to be a lil cheaper as long as their drink menu. I bought 3 pastry and a smoothie drink total came out to $8.50 not bad. I havent tried the pastry yet, but I have tried the mango banana smoothie. The smoothie was very sour not sure if its from the mango itself. I only got one lil piece of banana sliced in half. Cant really taste the banana in the smoothie.', u\"5 stars from customers service to unique pastry to cute taste cakes. Don't forget about those refreshing drinks! \\nSo glad to have a nice pastry shop close to work\", u\"Came here for the 2nd time, iced coffee not bad, had their cream puff (1st time l came here) which l liked, not too sweet & it was light. The 2nd time l had iced coffee again and their version of tiramisu. That was ok, not the traditional tiramisu but not bad. I'd come back again, would love to try other stuff. It's also nice to have a different type of bakery in the area than the usual. Friendly crew, clean, which is always a plus! Will be back.\", u\"The coffee here is a lot better than what you can find in other stores. It's so smooth and rich, and they even have cold brew, which is my personal favorite. They serve lattes and cappuccinos, and you can adjust the taste of your coffee by asking for extra shots of espresso or pumps of syrup for pretty cheap. I usually pair my coffee with like a Hokkaido Puff or maybe some macarons, which are both delicious baked items they have here. Overall, this place offer some high quality and delicious products, and would definitely recommend more people to become regulars here.\", u'Cute  Asian bakery.  It has a good atmosphere.  The staff were really helpful and nice.  I will probably go back to try more of their food,  the cream-puff I tried was good.', u'Nothing really special. Their breads are expensive and ordinary. Their green tea wintermelon cake was good $2. And their matcha with mango filling was alright. But a red bean green tea bread that was $3.50 was dry and boring. The breads are different but nothing really special.', u\"Nice pastries and buns. Staff friendly but don't know price of cake they advertise on yelp. Cakes are not to sweet which is a good thing.\"], u'190.Five Leaves': [u'This was such a fun little trendy spot! It was right on the corner with big glass windows. It was true New York style with little tables all right in a row. The ambiance was very casual and laid back with good service and high energy. \\n\\nI ordered the salmon poke bowl and LOVED IT! My friend had avocado toast. The display for both was lovely and the taste fresh. I thought the prices were a little on the high end but considering the quality and that we were right in Williamsburg it was justifiable. \\n\\nIf you are looking for a fun lunch or brunch spot I would definitely recommend!', u\"The food here is consistently great. Ricotta pancakes are amazing, coffee is amazing. This would be a 5-star review if the service was even passably decent.\\n\\nThe service will be consistently terrible forever, because Five Leaves knows the service can be any level of awful, and there will always be an hour-long line. Every time I've gone, the wait is 2-3x as long as we're told, people are seated ahead of people who've been waiting far longer, it takes 15+ minutes for a waiter to come for even a drink order, and orders take too long to be brought out. If you ask for a drink refill, the waiter will never bring it unless asked 2-3 more times over 10+ minutes. \\n\\nI'd be more likely to come here more than once every six months or so if it weren't for the service being among the worst of anywhere I've eaten. The food is really what saves it.\", u'Let me preface my GLOWING review of the food by getting the service out of the way. \\nThe hostess was fine, got us a table outside, and all was good. Until the waitresses, maybe\\nthe rudest service I saw while in NY. Straight attitude from start to finish. Juvenile attitude.\\n\\nNow the food; The chef(s), and whoever writes the menu should all be given a raise. \\nThe hanger steak and mashed potatoes I got may be one of the best meals I have ever tasted. The steak was Perfeccct. The potatoes we\\'re like butter, the broccolini strewn throughout was incredible, and the portions seemed too good to be true. At the end, all of us had to just stop for a minute and say \"damn.\" I can\\'t stop thinking about that steak. Best meal we had in NYC over 5 days of eating. Well done kitchen.\\n\\nWait staff, check your wack, entitled attitude and do your job like big girls.\\nEven with that annoyance, the food is worth it.', u\"Five Leaves is easily one of my favorite brunch spots in NY. It seems like there's usually a long wait on the weekends but luckily my friends and I took off work on Friday and managed to be seated right away. Word has it that Heath Ledger was an investor in this restaurant before it opened. Although he passed away, his family continued to help make this business possible.\\n\\nAt first glance, their menu offers some pretty standard brunch items, but the food really speaks for itself here. We got the avocado toast, truffle fries and grilled chicken salad. The avocado toast was simple yet beautiful. There was just the right amount of toppings and spices to make it creamy and flavorful. I also loved that they used a toasted sour dough bread. As for the salad, it was pretty filling. The grilled chicken was thick, juicy and tender. You can taste that it was freshly made. My favorite part was that our truffle fries stayed crispy throughout our whole meal. We also wanted to try the infamous ricotta pancakes but the breakfast menu had just finished by the time we were seated. \\n\\nOverall, this was one of my most enjoyable brunch experiences in NY. The only reason I held back on giving it five stars was the customer service. It bothered me a little that the customer service here was so not on par with the food. But that doesn't seem to stop people from coming here. I'm definitely going to be back.\", u\"When we arrived here for a Monday morning brunch, the half an hour wait told me it would be amazing. My friends come here often and had good things to say, so I was looking forward to it. We had the Ricotta Pancakes and the Big Brekkie. The pancakes are far and away the best pancakes I've ever had the pleasure of having in my life. Words can't express how perfect they are so you'll have to just try them yourself. The Big Brekkie is also great which features the common breakfast comfort items. Any breakfast with toast, beans, and eggs is alright with me.\", u\"GREAT SPOT!! They even have a walk up coffee window. My breakfast was all I could ask for. I had the breakfast with 2 poached eggs, saut\\xe9ed mushrooms (amazing), avocado, hash browns, and wheat toast. \\n\\nThe hash browns are the best I've ever had! \\n\\nSit outside and soak up the locals!\", u\"I don't venture out to Brooklyn too often, but a friend who used to live in Brooklyn & now lives abroad was in town and asked to go here. We went around noon on a Monday and it was pretty packed for a weekday. Had no trouble getting a table. I loved the way they set up the bar and the pretty flower table settings they had. \\n\\nWe ordered four dishes for three people -- we were all quite full by the end of the meal. The portions were very generous and everything was amazingly delicious. We got: the black kale salad with spicy anchovy dressing, aged gouda & hazelnuts. I loved the dressing, but it might not be for everyone. Not too spicy in my opinion. We also got the housemade ricotta with figs, fresh thyme, honeycomb, & maldon sea salt. I absolutely loved the chunks of honeycomb that came with this dish -- it went really well with the ricotta. \\n\\nWe also got the ricotta pancakes with honeycomb butter, banana, strawberries and blueberries. All of the fruit was so fresh and like I mentioned before, the portions were really generous. My FAVORITE dish today was the steamed mussels in a saffron & coconut sauce, chilies, and scallions. Oh my goodness. The dish came with bread squares to soak up the sauce. \\n\\nI'll definitely be back to try the other dishes. Loved everything about this place!\", u'Ohhhhh man...this place was out of this world. I had the Moroccan Scramble and the Ricotta Pancakes for desert (lol). They cook their eggs in a way that leaves them fluffy and delicious. The pancakes are the right balance between sweet and savory. That are served with bananas and strawberries. At first I looked at the bananas and said, \"Who needs this banana!!\" After a few bites i thought to myself, I wonder what a bite would be like if I mix it with a banana? It was phenomenal. It added a whole new dimension to the pancake. \\n\\nI finished it off with a double espresso. They served it the correct way. Some places will give you a full cup of espresso and call it a double. They did it right just a little bit more than a mouthful. \\n\\nService was also excellent. \\n\\nHighly recommend this spot for brunch on Sunday.', u\"We took advantage of the Labor Day weekend and were seated 20 minutes after arriving at 11am. The food was good albeit extremely slow. Apparently the pancakes take a while to make? I was running out of conversation with my friend, that's how long it took for the food to come! \\n\\nThe quiche was the real standout here. It was crispy, salty, and so satisfying. Skip the hashbrowns - the fries smelled way better!!! I would not come back for the legendary pancakes alone. But the butter they put on top..... It's way better than Aunt Jemima's I'd say.\", u\"Brunch in Brooklyn has never been tastier. Delicious options, cute atmosphere, outdoor seating, reasonably priced, all was amazing...except for the sucky service. \\n\\nFive Leaves is a quaint cafe in the heart of Williamsburg. It's tucked away on a corner of McCarren Park, which makes it a go-to spot after a day spent outside in the park.  My roommate would always rave about this place. So when my mom was in visiting, I got my opportunity to check this place out. \\n\\nThe place, I've heard, is usually packed on the weekends. Luckily, I took off one monday so we managed to sit down right away. My mom and I decided to split the big brekki and the ricotta pancakes. She was disappointed that they didn't serve eggs Benedict, but managed to compromise and kind of make a version of eggs benedict out of the brekki (poached eggs, always a good idea with extra avocado). I ordered the ricotta pancakes, which really was out of this world. SO DELICIOUS. I would go back just to order them again.\\n\\nEverything was amazing. They gave the right amount of food, not too much not too little. All so good...it was just the service that was lacking. They're kind of slow here and all over the place, so don't come starving or be in a rush. Despite the service, this spot is definitely worth a visit, especially for those wonderful pancakes.\", u\"I have been living around the corner from Five Leaves for a year now but have been avoiding it because I didn't want to believe the hype.  The very first day I moved here someone recommended Five Leaves, but I just wrote her off as a transplant hipster type of person.  On Sunday, my boyfriend and I were looking for a quick brunch.  Thanks to you, Yelp App, I decided to give Five Leaves a try. \\n\\nOn Sundays especially, I usually see about twenty people waiting for a table.  I am not with it.  I tried to convince my boyfriend that we could eat our own steak, bacon and eggs at home.  I ended up walking to Five Leaves to see if I could put my name down on a list as I anticipated a long wait.  At 1030 on Sunday morning there was no wait.  I looked too ugly to sit down for brunch, so I came back home to shower.  We returned at 1145.  There was a 30 minute wait.  It was a pretty mild day, so we sat on the nearby bench, people watched at chatted.  Even still, I didn't want to believe the hype.  Why were so many people waiting for $6 bacon?\\n\\nWe got a table inside.  It was nice to enjoy the charming interior but we were close enough to the door to still people watch.  Best of both worlds!  I got the BLT and my boyfriend got the breakfast option that pretty much gave him everything: steak, eggs, homefries, bacon, and avocado.  Both meals were very well portioned and perfectly prepared.  What I thought was gonna be some bougie overpriced Williamsburg brunch was exactly right.  I got a latte that was also really delish too!\\n\\nThe BLT isn't your standard BLT.  It came on a hamburger bun so it was very filling.  So much so, I thought about it all day long and got another one the next day from the takeout window.  The service was pretty friendly and efficient too during brunch, even though I did see our server roll her eyes when there were people standing by the door.  \\n\\nI just had to take one star off because when I came back to the takeout window, the staff (3 different people) kind of just looked at me without asking what I wanted for a few minutes...when I thought greeting patrons was like, Customer Service 101.  Since there's no formal place to meet a hostess, it seems like everyone is just winging it... making for a frustrating time for both staff and patrons.\", u\"Amazing food. We had the crispy duck rice bowl and a burger. Both amazing. The outdoor seating was lovely on a warm early fall evening. Busy place so don't expect fast service.\", u\"It gets pretty packed for Sunday brunch but no wait to sit at the bar. \\n\\nWe got the three grain bowl $14 which had quinoa, rye, farro with watermelon radish asparagus, salsa verde and poached eggs. IT WAS AMAZING. Super light and refreshing, the poached eggs were SO fresh, the egg whites kind of tasted like cheese and I was confused for a second. The farro had this really good dressing and the portions were just right. I tried recreating this dish at home but it still can't outshine this dish. \\n\\nWe also got the ricotta pancakes $16 which were MONSTROUS. I recommend sharing with two-three people. They come with honey comb butter (which is the thing in the pictures that looks like a scoop of ice cream) and OMG SO GOOD. The whole thing tastes like cake, especially with the maple syrup and butter, you could easily eat it as dessert after dinner. The strawberries and blueberries they had on top of it were PERFECTLY ripe and sweet. The pancakes were soft and fluffy and steaming hot when I cut into it. \\n\\nOverall, I will definitely come back to try more from their menu (or maybe just get that three grain bowl). The food was delicious and came out at a reasonable time, people working there were friendly. They have outdoor seating as well which is cute. It's right across from a park so it's peaceful. The place has a rustic barn feel and everything felt super cozy.\", u\"My boyfriend and I did brunch here after seeing their Vice cooking video on You Tube. He ordered the sausage spicy chick pea scramble on sour dough and I ordered the ricotta pancakes with fruit. Those pancakes were DELICIOUS. The buttery sugary topping (had some fancy name, I don't do it justice) was so so good. It was nice enough to eat the pancakes with the butter topping and the fruit alone. Great service, pleasant outdoor seating, affordable. Happy we found this place!\", u\"4.5 rounded down.\\n\\nSO GOOD!\\n\\nWe came at opening on a Saturday as there's always a line and indeed there was already a growing number of patrons.\\n\\nStaff is a mixed bag - the host is a bit aloof, doesn't enunciate and thew our menus at us, but our hostess was very friendly and helpful. \\n\\nFood was exceeded expectations - too many brunch places in NY offer tasteless, pricey food.  We ordered the big brekkie with bacon and avocado, and the Moroccan Scramble.  Both were seasoned very well, had balanced flavors, and used quality ingredients.  SO VERY GOOD!\\n\\nPrice point is a bit high, but I get it...  \\n\\nWe'll return if we can avoid the line, but now we know why there's always a line!\", u'Believe the hype, this is one of the best breakfast/Brunch spots in Northern Brooklyn. Conveniently located across from McCarren park, the place is buzzing all day long on Saturdays and Sundays. The inner space is rather small and quaint, but seating doubles in the summer months with a nice patio area. They have a nice selection of cocktails, plus an interesting brunch menu. Of course I usually go for the avocado toast. For evening meals, the burger is one of their specialty. Ladies, lookout for the easy on the eyes bartenders if scruffy hipster dudes are your type.', u\"Worth the hour wait in 32 degree F weather to try their Australian fusion menu.\\n\\nSpace - It's got a rustic appeal with the wooden paneling and soft lighting. Love the touch on the bathroom door, which reminds me of a submarine door. \\n\\nService - Super chill and attentive staff. Even though the place was packed for brunch, the server was very amiable.\\n\\nRicotta Pancakes - Light, fluffy, and topped with a dollop of coffee butter. I tried to restrain myself, but went ape on the coffee butter. Too good. This is a must try if you make your way down to Brooklyn.\", u\"Stop everything you're doing and COME HERE. the brunch they've got going on is amazing and their pancakes are simply to die for.\\n\\nCame here around 1pm on a Saturday and of course it was busy. We must've waited around 30 mins for a table and were then seated at the table closest to the door. Not a bad spot, but the reflection of the sun on the table (due to lack of shades or awning) wasn't that pleasing.\\n\\nI ordered the Ricotta Pancakes and my boyfriend ordered the Five Leaves Burger. I'm usually a savory person during anytime of the day- but saw another party order the pancakes and just had to have them! They came in the most glorious form- thick and fluffy, loaded with fruits, and topped with some spiced butter and some maple syrup on the side. So filling, so satisfying, too much for me to finish (although I wish I had a second stomach because I didn't want to stop eating it). Highly recommend the pancakes if you end up here.\\n\\nOverall- great food, but service could use a lot of improvement. Our server was almost nonexistent, except for when they came to take our order.\", u\"Never a bad meal here. This place is always busy and it's for a reason. Of of my favorite places, periods The food is done right. You never leave hungry and you your wallet doesn't hurt either. The Amish chicken is my go to. Also a great burger, lentil soup and blackberry gelato! Friendly staff, good atmosphere. You won't have a complaint\", u\"Hmm, it's a cute spot, but very tight. Sorry, but the pancakes ARE overrated! The ricotta pancakes had no flavor. The bananas, strawberries, and syrup made it better. I have yet encounter a restaurant whose pancakes that can out do Cafe Luluc in Brooklyn.\"], u'109.June': [u'I cannot give less than 5 stars!\\nWe reserved a table and when we arrived she walked us to one of the table in between others. I know most NY bar/restaurants put tables really close but I am not comfortable sitting so close to other table and pretend I\\'m not listening to their conversation! So I asked her if we can sit by the bar, and because there was no room for two by the bar she just upgraded us to a 4 person table! Without hesitation or saying the cliche \"oh this table is for 4!\". So I was impressed by what she offered for our convenience.\\nThe place is cozy and all the decoration and good taste of color selection and lighting brought it a nice character.\\nThe numerous wine selection was great and We enjoyed our sparkling rose. The food was tasty and we enjoyed everything we ordered. Service was good and staff are super friendly with a real nice smile. \\nSeems I was obsessed with that table in the corner so I\\'m posting a picture of it.\\nWe had a great time.', u'I am new to the neighborhood and was excited to check out June with two of my friends who rave about it. Sadly, we were all very disappointed. The number one issue was the service. As a former waitress, I always give the servers the benefit of the doubt, however even I couldn\\'t find a way to excuse the service issues last night. We were SO ignored from the moment we were sat and then later made to feel like a complete nuisance by the host when we finally asked him to get our server\\'s attention (a huffy \"what do you want?\"  was the exact phrasing of his response as we sat there with empty drinks and empty plates covering the table). And then, inexplicably, after finally getting a second round of food, the second waitress came and started clearing all of our uneaten dishes without even inquiring if we were done! \\n\\nIf the food had been stellar then maybe that would have helped to make the experience more enjoyable, but honestly we weren\\'t blown away at all. We ordered several items - the Gemma salad, bread and drip, beets, fennel and crab, snapper and melon. The bread was really tasty, hence a second order was placed once we could flag someone down. The beets were also good Everything else was not, especially the fishy smelling and tasteless $28 snapper. All in all we spent over $200 between three of us and were made to feel like second class citizens while having pretty meh food the majority of the time. I really wanted to like June and make it my neighborhood go-to spot, but it looks like I won\\'t be returning.', u\"A very cozy and fun place that we were surprised to find in Cobble Hill.  It felt romantic and dim as soon as you walk in.  Staff was friendly and service was fast.\\n\\nThey have a large wine and drinks list.  The dishes have unique flavors and well prepared with top quality ingredient.  They have quite a number of French wines to choose from.  We opted for a bottle of Ruth Lewandowski Boaz that paired beautifully with the lamb breast.  Everything tasted great and we didn't want to leave the place.  Will come back for more...\", u\"June is a swanky wine bar, designed by the amazing team behind Home Studios. June is both cozy and comfortable and fancy at the same time--the perfect place for dates, chatting with friends, and having a nice glass of wine anytime of the week. The servers are on point, making suggestions and happy to offer tastes of wines before you plunge in. The outdoor patio/garden is extra charming, but as so fills up on nice days/nights. I've been about three times now, and have always left in a good mood. I haven't had the food, but the menu changes, and plates seem to be on the smaller side. I look forward to drinking more good wine at June soon!\", u\"Went at 11am on a Sunday when it opens - no crowds and got the quiet backyard to ourselves. Cute space. Our server was so friendly. We went with her recommendations - savory bread pudding with ham, tomatillo and egg; frog in a hole with Shitake mushrooms. Got a side of slab bacon to share. \\n\\nThe bread pudding was so unique and delicious. Savory and soft with ham inside the pudding, and tangy tomatillo adds a ton of flavor to it. The frog in the hole was good - I enjoyed the mushrooms and the soft center of the egg. But it wasn't super flavorful/didn't stand out to me as much. The bacon was very well cooked. \\n\\nI love how they have a short, seasonal menu. All the more incentive to go back and try other dishes before they are gone. Wasn't blown away but definitely one of my favorite neighborhood brunch places overall.\", u\"Beautiful spot for the intimate and romantic date that you seek.\\n\\nThey have great music and curiously more people willing to be seated at the bar than the table. The answer probably is the bartender makes some mean and fearful drinks. \\n\\nThis place offers tapa style dinner while the serving might be small but the flavor is top of the class. We love the lamb and hummus with bread. There are many many dishes to pick from however we suggest to order them one at the time as the table isn't really that big. \\n\\nSeating is not an issue before 7:30PM however that's when most people started to enter. As online said no RSVP, that is not true. You should really call them and they will accommodate. Waiting staffs are wonderful and very very professional.\", u\"The cocktails here were pretty okay. Didn't like the Modern Guilt too much after the first few sips, but the Fear & Whiskey was nice. Deceivingly strong as well.\\n\\nWe had the polenta (meh), the mushrooms (meh), and the pork shoulder entree (meh). The chicken liver pate was pretty good, but nothing really stood out in terms of food.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was very homey and relaxed, good for a casual dinner.\\n\\nService was okay too.\\n\\nWorth a try if you're in the neighborhood.\", u\"I used to be really in love with this joint! The drink selection has always been impressive, the cocktails are so GOOD and the food is decent as well. However, when I go to have a drink, it's to be relaxed. Do I go to have a cocktail and hear about how much you don't like having a new back waiter? Or how you wish they would just let you work alone? No. That puts all of your guests in uncomfortable spots. I also think that it take the class from 10 to 0 when you gossip about your coworkers while you have guests nearby. Yes. This really happened, Friday the 8th, I listened to my bartender Selma gossip about some poor back waiter. I won't be back.\", u'Came here for a late brunch on a lazy Sunday after my archery session. The weather was hot yet beautiful outside. \\n\\nJune is a sexy little spot that takes you to a different world as soon as you walk in.  The inside was calm and cool with a soft buzz from all the patrons sitting at the bar.\\n\\nThe lighting was bright since it was day time, but all the booths lined up on the side gave the whole place a classic and relaxed feeling.  I would love to come see this spot again at night.\\n\\n\"Me and My Arrow\" seemed like a nice fitting cocktail to start with, and also ordered the duck rice and crostini.  The cocktail was really well made; refreshing with strong citrus notes.  \\n\\nThe duck rice had a deep flavor.  I would definitely order this again.  The salmon crostini was well balanced.  The smoked salmon and cream cheese with thick cut toast gave every bite a smooth and luscious texture.  \\n\\nAll the plates were neatly presented and tasted fantastic.  Would recommend all of them.', u'We had such a great evening at June! \\nMy friend and I ordered a bunch of small plates to share and by the end of the night, we were happily full! \\nShe had 2 glasses of the orange wine, it is a wine bar after all! Adrian was our server, and he was phenomenal! He brought her samples of the wine before she committed to drink an entire glasses! He also was very good at recommending plates for us to share. \\n\\nWe tried: \\n- the cucumber with whipped feta. That was delicious and refreshing! \\n- the bread and eggplant dip. That was a babaganoush style roasted eggplant dip. It was simple and delicious. The bread was rustic and perfect for the rest of the small plates! \\n- the grilled octopus was phenomenal! The toppings and the spicy sauce that was in the plate were perfect compliments to the fish. \\n- the dried ham was perfectly aged (is that a thing to say to compliment a dried ham?!) \\n- the lamb carpaccio. That was, to my opinion, a really different dish. Tasted just like a beef carpaccio, with the exact same texture, with a strong lamb tone. Very different, never had that before and I enjoyed it very much! \\n\\nFor dessert we shared a decadent chocolate ganache/cream/awesomely rich thing with cookie crumbs. It was perfect! \\n\\nI loved this place and would happily return when in the neighborhood!', u\"One of my favorite neighborhood gems in Carroll Gardens. It has a really extensive wine list ranging from white to sparkling red or white. \\nIt can be a bit tight so it's perfect for one on one time with a friend or a date. I love the food here. I usually get the bread & ricotta basket, turnips  and ham plate. I usually share the trout and get the olive cake for dessert. I love that it's alot of vegetable plates and they are really tasty and I don't feel guilty when I leave.\", u'June wine bar is THE place to go if you want a sick (that\\'s amazing) wine list, amazing food (not just tiny shared plates and \"nibbles\") and an outdoor garden option that is quintessential Brooklyn. Complete with rain cover just in case. Great staff, warm, patient, helpful... Rare 5 stars!!!', u\"I came here for Sunday brunch with a friend. It wasn't crowded at noon, which was nice. June is a cute, cozy spot with several tables for two across from a beautiful bar setup, and a few larger tables in the back, including an outdoor seating option. I wanted something light so I got the yogurt and granola, and my friend got the bonita bowl. Both dishes arrived looking very healthy, but mine was definitely a bigger hit of sugar than I'd been expecting. The yogurt was unsweetened, but the granola was very sweet, and there was a bit of honey drizzled on the yogurt as well. Definitely a good call if you have a sweet tooth, but I think I'd try something more savory in the future. My friend enjoyed her dish, and she had several teas that she really liked too - the iced tea (regular black) and a hot decaf chai. The service was friendly and attentive. The wine lists were extensive intriguing! I'd definitely like to come back sometime on an evening to get to try some of their more unique offerings.\", u\"One of the worst meals we've had in all of Brooklyn. Can't believe this place gets anything but trashed on yelp. \\n\\nFirst, don't come here if you want to actually have a conversation with the people you are with. The music is pointless, doesn't set any kind of mood, but it is LOUD LOUD LOUD. I'm not one to usually comment about the volume of a restaurant, but we could barely hear the people we were with and I am hoarse today from having to shout to just have a basic conversation with old friends. Not an auspicious entry.\\n\\nStarted out with the slowest, most lackadaisical service I've ever encountered. 20 minutes before we could flag someone down to take a drink order, another 20 minutes before the drinks arrived...We had to leap at waitstaff throughout the meal to get any service whatsoever. The cocktails were icky - the rum quality was questionable, the options were limited. Oh, it's a wine bar, you say, so why are you ordering cocktails? Well, when we moved to wine, we were steered towards a particular bottle by the waitress. Holy crap, it was absolutely undrinkable! It tasted like a cough drop and a package of nails were melted down and served to us. Is there someone actually in charge of ordering at this place or are they just taking whatever is available on steep discount?\\n\\nAnd to the food. The short rib that CLEARLY wasn't actually a short rib and couldn't have looked less appealing upon arrival. The grainy, plain ricotta dish. The fish with teeny tiny bones throughout (though some had been removed, so it was a surprise when you got a mouthful), the poorly cooked brussels sprouts, the merguez and squid with the white beans that were undercooked, and last but not least, the only highlight, the chicken liver pate, which I doubt they even prepared.  \\n\\nI have never, ever been steered so wrong by a yelp review. This place is AWFUL in every respect.\", u\"Good food and ambience. Beautiful art nouveau interior.\\n\\nGreat service from our waitress Ashley. Attentive but left room for conversation\\n\\nI'll be back June.\", u\"June was wonderful! \\nthe wine, the ambiance, the tapas, the decors and the waitress were all great!!\\nyou'll need to order many tapas for dinner, as each tapa are not to be shared for more than 2 persons.\", u'Welcoming staff.  Food menu is limited, but inventive. Wine choice is thoughtful. Good place if you appreciate sohpisticated palate, flavor and texture. Exceptional happy hour. Will return.', u\"I love this place, and have been here twice. The first time was on a cold winter night when I sat at the bar with a friend. We had some 'orange' wine (similar to rose) which I didn't even know existed. We also shared some small plates, all of which were delicious, including the mushrooms, brussels sprouts and a salad-all seasonal, light, fresh and definitely small yet satisfying. \\nI returned on a Friday night surprised at how empty it was and we scored a lovely booth. We had a bunch of drinks and it is just a beautiful pleasant atmosphere. Dark-romantic I suppose. I would bring a date here but totally fine and realizing for friends. They do close at 2am though.\", u\"Feel super lucky to call this my neighborhood bar. Great wine selection. Extremely friendly service and good food if you're hungry. Good place for groups but just as nice to have a glass of wine solo and chat with the bartenders. Keep it up, June.\", u'This place is kind of the best.\\n\\nAmbiance is amazing and tasteful; their back patio is perfect in the summer and interior is so very cozy in the winter. Have been here on several occasions, both for brunch which is light and fresh and so yummy as well as dinner. Dinner is great for sharing plates, definitely could consider this on the higher end of $$ but the food is SO worth it. Everything is incredible, their cocktails are nice, and they have a beautiful wine selection.\\n\\nLove coming back over and over again, and June warrants 5 stars all the way.'], u'50.Hometown Bar-B-Que': [u\"Everyone can already pretty much agree Hometown is the best in NYC as far as 'Q goes. This review is give props to their to-go and catering team. I had a party of 25 and Jamie Lynn @ Hometown was a total pro in helping assess needs and ensuring the order got put together on time. \\n\\nI will definitely think of them next time I have a party. Thanks Hometown!\", u\"Solid BBQ joint. If you're a big fan of BBQ I almost guarantee you'll love this place. If you're like me and is that into BBQ, I would still recommend trying it because it just might change your mind! \\n\\nMy favorite things on the menu were the Jamaican Jerk Ribs, the turkey breast and the lamb belly. I have never been a fan of ribs because they're always drenched in sauce and I can't even taste the meat. But the jerk ribs here are seasoned but dry and offers great tastes and texture. The turkey breast was surprisingly tasty. The lamb belly is very greasy and hearty, so I would recommended getting less of that one. The sides were delicious, the cornbread and mac & cheese were my favorite two.\\n\\nThere's no waiter service, you order at the counter, get your number and they'll bring you your food. \\n\\nThe location is hard to get to if you don't have a far. The trains only get you so close and then you'll have to hop on a bus or walk. \\n\\nIt is conveniently located next to the pier so you can take a leisurely stroll after your meal. The views are amazing,especially at sunset, and you get a pretty good view of our Lady Statue of Liberty.\", u\"On my last visit to NYC, we took the free Ikea ferry to Brooklyn just to visit Hometown. Tip: If you're doing the same, wait for the second stop (Red Hook) which is a lot closer to the restaurant than getting off at Ikea. \\n\\nOn a Sunday evening, the line wrapped around the restaurant and I'd say we waited 40+ minutes just to order. There's lots of seating and a bar on the other side of the main dining area. It's got a very woodsy feel to the place and taxidermy on the wall. \\n\\nOnce we finally got the counter, we ordered the beef ribs ($35+ for a pound - you can't adjust the size!!!), brisket and pulled pork with 3 sides (cornbread, coleslaw and potato salad) to share. The cornbread and the smoked meat were the stars of the show...I don't usually have a lot of Southern food and really liked the smoky, flavourful and soft meat. The cornbread was sweet and a nice compliment to the rest of the meal, although I wish we skipped the potato salad, which was quite acidic. It was a long wait but the food was quite good. I don't know if it was worth standing in line for 40 minutes and a trek across town, but if I'm ever back in Red Hook again, I would pay Hometown a visit.\", u\"I apologize for using the word amazing more than once in this review but I cannot help it, the food here was amazing! My friend and I have been craving BBQ food for like 2 weeks and lucky for us I come across Hometown Bar-B-Que! I read about the line situation and hoping it wouldn't take us that long to eat and lucky for us it only took like 45 minutes. After we ordered our food was ready pretty quickly so I don't understand why it takes so long for the line to just move. \\n\\nAnywho, we wanted to try just about everything on the menu but we scaled our order to the beef rib, brisket tacos, hot wings, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw and the whiskey sour pickles. Let's indulge! \\n\\nBeef ribs-Amazing! I did not know ribs could be that tender. It literally fell of the bone and it seasoned perfectly and so much meat! I ate it with the spicy and sweet sauce and that gave it even more of a kick. Just yum! \\n\\nBrisket tacos-Not my favorite, unfortunately I was only able to get through a half of one. They were pretty dry and missing flavor. \\n\\nVietnamese hot wings-I'm in love with these chicken wings. They were amazing. The sauce was spicy and sweet and the garnishes enhanced the flavor-sooo good! Oh and the cilantro ranch was the perfect dipping sauce for these wings. \\n\\nMacaroni & cheese-Very yummy, I was afraid it was going to taste like generic macaroni and cheese but they did their thing. It had the right amount of cheese and was seasoned well. \\n\\nWhiskey sour pickles-My friend wanted these pickles so bad lol so we got them. They tasted like pickles to me but she loved them. \\n\\nColeslaw-I love coleslaw and this one did not disappoint. It tasted very fresh and their coleslaw had a bit of tanginess to it. Delicious. It was a good addition to our BBQ meal because it was so heavy. \\n\\nThis restaurant gets 4 and a half stars. I took off a half star because of the brisket tacos and its was kinda pricey here. However my friend and I did enjoy everything else we had. The decor of the restaurant was very cool and I liked the atmosphere. We are already planning to come back very soon and so should you!\", u'A brisk touch of the soul: true food for the barbecue lover with some twists \\n\\nHaving already waited an hr for Brooklyn Crab, we diverted our eyes to this Hometown neighbor that was also buzzing. Waited 30min on a late Saturday night, some of their stuff was out like lamb belly but they do seem to try to replenish if they can. \\n\\nThe brisket is the star of the show. 1/2 lb gets you about 1 thick slice of tender buttery deliciousness. Although I prefer my brisket a bit more smoky, this was spot on southern BBQ. You know it\\'s quality when the leftovers eaten the next day are still so moist and succulent.\\n\\nRibs - good. Not exactly fall in love off the bone, but better than average. \\n\\nVietnamese hot wings are OK. You could go without it. Very forgettable. The \"ranch\" sauce is a huge mismatch. \\n\\nTexas queso Mac and cheese is awesome. Usually I prefer more contrasting textures, but 5 stars for taste. Definite must get. \\n\\nCollard greens - passing grade. Get it if you need your veggies to digest the carnivore splurge. \\n\\nCorn bread - disappointing considering the great barbecue. I wouldn\\'t get again unless you really want your cornbread. Side note: tastes better if you reheat over stove next day for it to caramelize. \\n\\nI think what sets this joint back from full-on glory are their barbecue sauces. I\\'m really not impressed. I would choose other sauces if I could. Their hot and sweet sauce has good spicy profile (just a slight zing) but it doesn\\'t elevate the food. \\n\\nBottom line: a taste of southern love in the north that I\\'m coming back for more (brisket, mac and cheese)!', u\"Went for Lunch\\n\\nFood - 5/5. Everything here is good! If you like BBQ, you will love the food here. The brisket is so tender that when I went to grab it with my fork, the piece broke off. Chicken wings have an amazing balance of sweet and zesty lime with creamy cilantro ranch to cool it off. The collard greens are awesome; so juicy and seasoned perfectly! Lamb belly bahn mi is so rich the juices drip out while the pickled vegetables keeps the flavors from being overpowering. Even the pickles are awesome! Great, great BBQ!\\n\\nService - 4/5. The place is self serve but they bring the food out to you in small sheet trays.\\n\\nValue - 5/5. The prices are on the higher end but you are really paying for quality. The BBQ here is so good that you won't worry about the dollar signs. Value includes quality and quality what they serve!\\n\\nParking - Street (Free)\", u\"One of the most painful process I had ever experienced in getting food. We came around 6:30pm on a Sunday, and the line wrapped around the restaurant. It looked like a pit style kind of restaurant, so we assumed the line would go fast. Boy were we wrong. It was painfully slow, and by the time we realised how slow it was, we had invested too much time. (Very) long story short, we were on line for 2 hours and very hangry and starving by the time we got to the front. There were only 2 people taking orders - One for the BBQ and one for the sides. Oh, also, drinks were at the bar... totally different. You cant even get a soda at the front register. It was a very inefficient way of running a business. \\n\\nThe food was SPECTACULAR. It was very good barbeque, but we were a bit cloudy in our judgement given we waited for food for so long, we weren't sure if it was good, or we were just starving. We got the 1/2lb of brisket, the pulled pork sandwich, the Korean sticky ribs and banana cream pudding. Everything was good. The brisket was very tender and flavorful. The pulled pork was great as well. The sauce on the Korean ribs were outstanding. The banana cream pudding was also a great dessert. \\n\\nIn total: service is 0 stars, the price (grossly overpriced) is a 1 star and the food a 5 star. Overall experience: 2 stars. Yeah, the wait was THAT bad. Coupled with the overall way they were taking orders and the snail-like pace of the workers - I will most likely fly to Texas for BBQ before I return here.\", u'This place is legit! Hometown BBQ looks like a small warehouse with a large indoor open space with 2 sections for dining. I came here during Labor Day afternoon and to my surprise, I only had to wait about 20 minutes. I ordered the brisket, spare ribs and Korean sticky ribs. My favorite were the spare ribs that were perfectly tender, smoky and slid right off the bone, and the Korean ribs that was drenched in a delicious garlic sauce and scallions. The brisket was alright, I thought some of the meat was too lean/dry, and was missing some flavors. I also had the cornbread, which was good but had a slight plastic aftertaste. I had a margarita ($12) from the bar and it was really strong! I really enjoyed the atmosphere, it was really laid back and I was able to eat, drink and hang out without feeling rushed. It was mostly self-served as well. \\n\\nI want to come back to try other other meats on the menu, I saw them make the brisket sandwich and it looked massive and juicy AF.', u\"My coworker who grew up around here swears by this place. After listen to him glow about it for a solid 6 months, we finally went. I love meat (in moderation) and BBQ, so it was definitely on. I decided to have the pastrami bacon, brisket, corn bread, and queso mac and cheese. The brisket was definitely above average, though not the absolute best I've ever had. The pastrami bacon was really good and that first bite was awesome. Corn bread above average and the queso mac and cheese was a nice change from a normal mac and cheese. The interior reminded me a lot of Green Street Smoked Meats in Chicago which is a good thing. Good ambiance.\\n\\nAll in all, I haven't had a ton of BBQ in NYC but this is so far the best and a pretty good standard. I would recommend for any lover of BBQ.\\n\\nSide note: You and your clothes WILL smell heavily of smoke/meat after eating here\", u'Be prepared to way on a long line. I came here several times at night and I\\'ve always had to wait. I promise it\\'ll be worth the wait. And don\\'t forget order the brisket! This is my favorite thing. Every time I order brisket, I get it part fat and the server either gives me a smile or tells me something along the lines of \"that\\'s the best\". Of course it\\'s the best, you get the best of both worlds. The fat just melts in your mouth and is so full of flavor. The brisket itself is very moist, tender, and juicy. Another thing I always get is the corn bread. Give this corn bread a chance because it isn\\'t dry or too sweet.\\n\\nI would say skip the pastrami bacon. It was way too fatty for me. The fat was too overwhelming. I could only have 2 bites. I think if I had more, I might get nauseous. If you want to try it, you can ask them for one slice of it. You don\\'t have to buy the whole half pound of it.\\n\\nAlso they\\'re opening a location in industry city soon!', u\"This is, undoubtedly, the best BBQ I've had in NYC thus far. As a Texan, I'm always on the hunt for good brisket. Most places in NYC, I can simply look at the brisket and know it's not right or it won't be tender. This is the first place I've visited where one look at the brisket had my stomach jumping for joy. \\n\\nI had the brisket sandwich and the baked beans when I visited. I usually NEVER get sandwiches, but I really recommend grabbing one here if you're not looking to have leftovers. It was the perfect portion size and came with a deliciously buttered bun. And that brisket....boy oh boy!  That was tasty. It had so much flavor that you really didn't need BBQ sauce, which is the true sign that brisket was done well. The baked beans also had a TON of brisket in them, so it was like a two for one! \\n\\nI'd honestly just come here for the ambiance. I loved the big, open layout and the fact that they have musicians play while you're throwing down on a rib or drinking a beer. This place gave me hometown vibes, and that's the type of experience I want when it comes to dining out. \\n\\nCatch a water taxi. Grab a bus. Take a Lyft. Do whatever you have to do to get to Red Hook to try this place. Some well smoked meats will be waiting for ya!\", u\"Who would have thought that NYC would blossom into a BBQ haven in the good ol' US of A?! And among the plethora of options (Hill Country, Dinosaur, Fette Sau, Blue Smoke, etc.) that now reside within the 5 boroughs, the hype train has recently been around relative newcomer Hometown Bar-B-Que (est. 2013).\\n\\nFor the last year, it seems I couldn't avoid reading about Hometown as it had been topping every best of BBQ list in NYC that I laid my eyes on. I even caught them on an episode of DDD on the Food Network! We just had to check it out for ourselves.\\n\\nJust a few blocks away from the Ikea in Red Hook is Hometown. You absolutely cannot miss it with it's big bold letters on its walls.We dropped in on a recent Friday evening at around 6:30pm and foot traffic was modest at the restaurant, which we were happy about. We were afraid the place would be packed with the hype around it. There was a steady stream of customers coming in and also seated. There were plenty of seats available in the main dining room and the adjacent one though.\\n\\nThe second we walked in, we saw the menu plastered on the wall to our left where the ordering line formed. As with many BBQ joints, there was no surprise with the typical brisket, pulled pork, ribs (beef, short) and sides. However, there were a few other new items that caught our eye, specifically, the Korean Sticky Wings, Lamb Belly and Jamaican Jerk Baby Back Ribs. Yeah I know, they all sound REAL good! After scanning thru the menu, probably like many, we wanted everything, but our wallets could only take us so far!\\n\\nWe ended up comprising (unfortunately) and ordering 2 strips of the brisket, 1/4 lb of the lamb belly, a half rack of the Jamaican Jerk Baby Back Ribs and 2 sides (Mac and Cheese and Smoked Pit Beans). We really wanted the sticky wings too, but ultimately went with the lamb belly. Just an FYI for everyone who is curious about what the minimum amount of meat a customer could order is. For the brisket, each cut is about 1/3 of a lb, which is the minimum. For the rest of the meat where the prices are by the 1/2 lb, they can be ordered by the 1/4 lb. Follow me?\\n\\nSo was it all worth it? \\n\\nThree words: HELL FREAKIN' YEAH! \\n\\nEverything was just on point and, even better than we anticipated! The brisket was so fatty, juicy and tasty. It had that nice black char to its skin. The lamb belly reminded us of pulled pork from BBQ spots, but juicier and flavorful. The Jamaican jerk baby back ribs were so tender and the meat fell right off the bone when ripping into it. One knock on them though was that I couldn't taste too much of the Jamaican spice, but they were still very good. The mac and cheese was excellent and the smoked pit beans were really unique. Although my fiance wasn't big on the beans, I loved them. They had a strong smoky flavor to them with bit-size burnt ends mixed in.\\n\\nWhat else can I say? Just superb BBQ throughout. The counter service was friendly as well. We will definitely be back for the rest of the menu, including those Korean Sticky Wings!\", u\"Having grown up in Texas, I feel like I'm a pretty good judge when it comes to good BBQ. I'm always skeptical to try BBQ places since my expectations are pretty high, but oh boy Hometown hit the jackpot for me.\\n\\nThe interior is very spacious and chill. I came here on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm, and the line was outttt the door. Don't let this fool you though because it moves pretty fast! You can also grab a drink or two at the bar while you wait in line.\\n\\nFor my boyfriend and I, this was too much food, but so so so worth it. We ordered 1/2 brisket, 1/2 lamb belly, 1 sausage link, small mac n cheese, small smoked pit beans, and a slice of cornbread. The brisket and lamb belly are both so tender the meat falls apart from your fork. The sausage is so flavorful but not overwhelming. The sides were all really amazing as well. I usually don't like beans, but I absolutely love them at Hometown. My bf doesn't care about cornbread, but he really liked them here as well!\\n\\nHometown is a little on the pricey side, but I think it's definitely worth it. I can't wait to come back!\", u\"I'm kind of a weekend carnivore. That is, I behave and eat my veggies, seafood and legumes throughout the week, and let loose on the weekend.  So when I'm ready to eat meat, I want it to be really special and worthwhile.  Hometown definitely makes the cut.  \\n\\nA group of us recently split some Jerk half rack, Korean glazed baby back, and some pulled pork tacos.  We added some collard greens and potato salad as well.   All of it was very tender and tasty. The Korean glaze with the fired garlic and scallions were particular hits at our table.  There was some beer as well, but, honestly, I was paying more attention to the tender and flavorful meat, so I can't remember which ones they were. \\n\\nThis is undoubtedly the best BBQ option in southern Brooklyn. Sure, it's not the most accessible, but definitely worth the effort to get there,\", u\"Super casual country BBQ place. Its very spacious and laid back. Even if you aren't a huge fan of BBQ this is the place for you; I am not a huge BBQ person but there is no denying this place is top notch. \\n\\nI came for dinner with a large group. I ordered the pulled port; it was really good but was a little spicy, I also ordered the mac and cheese, potato salad, and cornbread. The mac and cheese is very creamy but I absolutely loved it. Their cornbread was also pretty good, a little drier than I prefer but good. The only thing I did not like was the potato salad; its mashed and has an extremely weird taste. I also tried a piece of their brisket, so good!\\n\\nA plus is that they offer free cold water to their customers. \\n\\nAs far as prices, its not bad. Each small side is $4 and their meat goes by weight. Don't feel limited by the menu because you can change the weight of your meat to 1/4 [what i had], 1/3, etc.\\n\\nHIGHLY recommend.\", u'Best BBQ NYC. Pastrami bacon. Pulled duck. Rib steak. Wings. And I love the dill potato salad. Their corn bread. \\n\\nAll other sides/ meats are good too. So are their drinks. What do u call a cut above the cut? Hometown. \\n\\nMUST.GO.', u\"Overall, a solid BBQ joint. It's kinda far, it's close to the IKEA and the Fairway Market, but the cue is good and the space is large and comfortable. Overall, I was happy with my meal but I really loved the table side sauces, both were made in house, I really liked the Sticky sauce and Hot and Sweet sauce. My friends and I got there at noon on a Friday and there was no wait, but 5 minutes later, the line extended to the door, so get there early. The restaurant is setup cafeteria style where you wait in line, you order at the counter and then you take your food to a table, there is seating on both sides of the restaurant. The side of the restaurant that doesn't have the kitchen or the line is much cooler, it was probably 10 degrees cooler on that side.\\n\\nThe food: \\n\\nLamb Belly- This was my fav item, it was more like a braised lamb belly than BBQ. It was super moist, it also had a very pronounced lamb flavor which I really enjoyed but could be off putting for some. I really liked it a lot but it was served room temp, I wish it was served hot. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=EPHDAiMh8cjLBISw0dkiiA&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\\n\\nBeef Rib- The beef rib was fucking huge! It was so damn tender on the inside, the meat was so moist and juicy, the outside was nice with all the spices but had some chewy parts. Overall, it is a must order even though it is was kinda pricey at $28/pound. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=dfOSKoDsHime7B32w9OY3g&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA \\n\\nThick Slab Pastrami Bacon- The pastrami is kissed on the grill before being served. The pastrami bacon was great and I really loved their homemade honey mustard sauce which had a little bit of a kick to counter some of the fattiness of the bacon. As much as I enjoyed the bacon, I kept on thinking it tasted like ham lol https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=NkA3XvyHitwt-ck4ZyTlRQ&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\\n\\nBrisket- Honestly, I was shocked I didn't love their brisket. I was expecting this to be my favorite thing here, I felt the brisket was kinda dry and the texture was a little tough. This made me sad =( https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OsrDbTwE2FqaPIQAkHxSjg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\\n\\nCollard Greens w. Smoked Pork Shoulder- This is kinda a necessity to add some vegetables in the meal. It's not really an exciting side, it was just OK, I wish they cooked the greens a bit more.\\n\\nTexas Style Queso Mac & Cheese- This was kinda meh too, the sauce was really thick and the pasta was way overcooked.\", u\"A subway ride and Uber to get here from Manhattan.   It's kind of in the middle of nowhere, if that's possible in Brooklyn.  \\n\\nI am from Alabama and have high hopes for this place.  I've been eating BBQ all my life and have trained with Myron Mixon, himself.  \\n\\nYou just go through the line and tell them what you want.  They'll give you a brisket sample, if you want.   They are very friendly, which I really wasn't expecting. I got my order to go.  \\n\\nThe pulled pork was moist and tender.   The sauce was the boss.  The brisket could've used a little more heat, but I'm used to real Texas brisket.  The Korean ribs were awesome.  No complaints. \\n\\nThe potato salad was whipped, almost like mashed potatoes.   Had a lot of dill in it.  The baked beans with burnt ends were spot on. \\n\\nThis may not be a Southern spot but they do a decent job of representing what BBQ is all about.   Check em out.  Roll Tide.\", u'Ferry into Redhook from the new line that opened up further south in Brooklyn was a great way to kick off our adventure \\n\\nWalking through the neighborhood there was a quaint charm that really captured a feel and time unlike what I have experienced in NYC \\n\\nAs for the food, you get in line and order the meats by the pound (no combo options). For beers, they have a separate section right when you walk in\\n\\nSausage - good snap, well seasoned +1\\nBrisket - good smoke, lacked seasoning, tender\\nLamb Belly - not too gamey, moist, nice balance of heat/spices etc +1\\nBurnt Ends - solid \\nPastrami Bacon - simply delicious, espcially paired with the mustard sauce! +1\\nJamacian Spare Ribs - a huge let down, seasoning was bland and lacked a meaty depth\\nMac & Cheese - all around good mac and cheese with no highs or lows \\nCollard Greens - pulled pork worked well with the greens \\nCorn Bread - good crusty exterior with a soft moist interior \\nWhiskey Pickles - good acidic kick to offset the heaviness of the meats (small is plenty) with a subtle whiskey punch \\n\\nPlenty of seating all around but lines to form quickly and tables will disappear \\n\\nThey also have a band area so live music must happen here which would be great while noshing on some BBQ and beers \\n\\nOverall Thoughts\\n\\nWorth the trip at least once if you are in the need of some solid BBQ', u\"Meats. Get'em all! \\n\\nVery popular establishment you should expect at least 40 min wait time in line. Do come in large groups so you can divide and conquer. Send part of your group to grab seats and the rest wait in line and order a good variety of everything to share. Do get the sides as they are just as good as the meats. \\n\\nNo. Don't come if you are vegetarian or vegan. No grill tofu here and the smoked beans are packed with meat juices.\"], u'183.Thip Osha': [u\"One of the best meals I've had in NYC. The resto is cute and small, affordable and BYOB for now. A total gem\", u'Jury is still out for me on this place. \\n\\nLily Thai, another restaurant, also on Grand has been my go to place for a while, but now I\\'ve tried Thip Osha thrice (once delivery).\\n\\nI was really excited the first time because it tasted spicier and had ingredients different and more original than the reliable Lily Grand.\\n\\nWhat makes it hard for me to switch completely\\nis I don\\'t remember being sufficiently impressed \\nSubsequent times.  \\n\\nI felt like I have to be impressed because it IS more expensive than Lily Thai while getting less. For instance there is no soup included with the lunch special.\\n\\nAlso Thip Osha is small,  and not in a cute or \"charming\" way, but in a cramped way.\\nI felt like there was hardly room for servers when hardly anyone was there, so I can\\'t imagine what it would be like when full. The thought of ten people there would keep me away. \\n\\nAlso while the food is presented in a very\\npretty and appetizing way, there is a view into the kitchen that is not \"charming\" (as it could be if done with creativity). I feel sorry for criticizing them \\non this, real estate is at such a premium in NYC, but size does matter!\\n\\nIf it was a bigger place, with similar pricing to Lily Thai it would be a no brainer that its better, but as it is, the last time I ordered Thai it was the older \\nplace and I didn\\'t feel like I was missing out at all.\\n\\nBoth places are good, even if the new one is \"hipper\", so I hope both are able to survive. \\n\\nHaving more choices is definitely a good thing in this case.', u'I really wanted to like this place but I have to be honest. I did not even taste the food but I do not recommend that you order from here. I ordered over the phone and specifically asked for change. However, the delivery guy did not have the change so I did not take the food. I refused to pay triple the price that I owed to this place because they decided to be neglectful. Sorry. If they at least offered to waive the fee because of their overlook, I would rave about this place. Unfortunately, first bad impressions tell a lot about a business:(', u'Best tiny solid Thai place in Williamsburg just have been found! Great food and friendly service. Crispy fish mango is the must! So tasty and juicy recommended !!', u'Khaow soy is excellent. The food was great and taste fresh.This restaurant gonna be my new favorite. Nice atmosphere and service.', u\"Best thai food I've had in Brooklyn.I love their Kee mao( drunken noodle)and papaya salad. Food was so fresh and all staffs was nice and friendly. This place is absolut my FAVORITE spot in nyc. Will come back again. 2thumbs up!!!!\", u'Very nice and warm environment with very testy Thai food around the neighborhood. You wont disappoint trying out this new place!', u'thank you for existing. best thai in the area by a really, really long shot.'], u'110.Kevin\\u2019s': [u\"I will be disappointed when the world finally understands just how good Kevin's is.  It will be full.  The lines will be long, and we won't be able to get in.  But so be it.  We have eaten there four times in the last couple of months and the food has been splendid, the service friendly and good, and the atmosphere comfortable.  From the amuse bouche at the beginning through the appetizers and the entr\\xe9es, to the very tasty desserts, we have been regularly surprised and pleased.  The wine list is solid if short, and ridiculously inexpensive.  Last night I had perfectly cooked rare, panko-encrusted tuna on a bed of veggies, one guest had tasty grilled snapper, and my wife (for the second time) and our other guest had the memorable paella.  Our wine was a $30 (!?) bottle of Gurner Veltliner that was perfect.  They were out of the raspberry tarte, so we broke down and had the splendid tiramisu (2 for four was plenty) which was served with a shot of sambuca.  I have no idea what that other person was complaining about, the coffee was excellent. And then there's the back story about the colorful history of the space... maybe the chef will fill you in.\", u\"Oh how I wanted to like this place so badly. The place was unique and had a great ambiance. Looking at  the menu everything sounded so good and I wanted to try everything, but luckily I didn't. \\n\\nThere was an appetizer on the house that came out with a shrimp on bread. Little did we know one of the pieces had metal in it and my friend swallowed it. She didn't know what it was at first and thought it was a fish tail. She told the waiter and he didn't seem very concerned. She just got bread and water to try to wash it down. Throughout the night it continued hurting and she went to the doctor and the X-ray shows that she had metal in her throat. We went back to the pictures we took at the restaurant and rest assured you can actually see the metal. \\n\\nIt is visible but no one really checks for metal before they eat things and it blended in with the dish. \\n\\nThe other food was just ok, more bland that I wished t to.\\n\\nWill not be back.\", u\"Our brunch was good but we wouldnt go back.\\n\\nLet's start with the positives: The food was good. I wasnt in the mood for brunch so I ordered the cioppino and my husband got the steak and eggs. The cioppino was very good, super flavorful and large. The steak was cooked well, a little plain but still well cooked. The food as a whole really wasnt our issue. \\n\\nOnto the things we werent so happy with: The coffee was HORRIBLE. They have Stumptown coffee (one of my FAVES) in little french presses. It was horrible. There wasnt enough coffee in the press and it was seriously GROSS. And for brunch one of the main things you want is good coffee. I was so disappointed. \\n\\nThe service was pretty bad. There was one waiter for the whole (not overly large) restaurant and he obviously was trying, but it was just too much for him. We had to sit next to a table (for 6) of dirty dishes for our entire meal because he didnt clean the table. He was just running around all over the  place doing everything (and not well) so all the little details you love to see in a small neighborhood restaurant were just missing. \\n\\nIf service isnt that important to you and you're looking for a decent meal in the area feel free to give it a shot.\", u\"Came here for lunch after participating Raaka Chocolate tour on Sunday.\\n\\nThis is a family style cosy little place in a quiet neighborhood. My friend and I shared a double pot coffee, which fills up about 4-5 mugs and we didn't finish it. My friend had the Cioppino Fish Stew and I had the Andirondack.\\n\\nMy Andirondack was nice overall and good portion, since there were 2 poached eggs on 2 pieces of chewy bread. The only dissatisfaction was about the fried fish which was too greasy, although the meat was tender. The oil even ran over the salad that was underneath the fish, soaking the lettuces in it. But still, I enjoyed my dish.\\n\\nMy friend's fish stew has quite portion, too. I helped her finish the plate and got to try the squid rings, scallops, and shrimps. They were cooked just right, juicy, tender, and fresh. I think the sauce would be perfect if you mixed up some rice to make it risotto like. It was flavorful.\\n\\nOur server was friendly. Despite the inconvenient location, I will go back and try their desserts next time.\", u\"We hosted a business lunch for our team at Kevin's and it was a wonderful experience. The team was incredibly helpful, the food was delicious (get the grilled tuna sandwich, lobster roll and blueberry pancakes) and the location was perfect. Highly recommended.\", u'Wonderful brunch and great service. The Cioppino fish stew and Adirondack poached eggs with fresh pan seared trout were excellent. Very relaxed.', u'The food here was superb, excellently prepared. I had the branzino special and flourless chocolate cake. The space, too, was very cute. Wholeheartedly recommend!', u\"Dirty and unhygienic restaurant. Wouldn't clear plates for a long time. Unfriendly, incompetent staff. Seafood over cooked. Took forever to get someone to take order and to get bill. Why is this place still in business??\", u\"This is the second time we've had brunch here. Amazing food and wonderful service and cozy vibe. I meant to post a review after the first time, but I was in a delightful food coma after enjoying the seafood stew that was the perfect comfort food on a cold winter day. Today I had the lobster roll that comes with a tasty side salad and homemade fries. Very generous portion of fresh lobster claws and tender pieces, perfectly seasoned. Washed it down with a couple of Kevin's Bloody Mary's. My brunch needs are well satiated. Looking forward to having dinner here.\", u\"Kevin's is one of my favorite restaurants in the red hook/ Carroll Gardens area.\\nThe interior is so cozy and lovely. The food is delicious. The owner is kind. It's a wonderful change of pace from the loud hip restaurants nearby.\\n\\nAlso their lobster roll and blueberry pancakes are sooooo good.\", u\"We went in just before mid day closing but we're welcomed in anyways and seated at the window. With two small families and baby in tow, we were taken care of with impeccable service and the host chatted us up while we waited for our food. I had the seafood stew which was out of this world. You know when you go to a seafood town and the seafood tastes like seafood you've never had before? Well that's what it was like here. Fantastic service, great food, good peoples.\", u\"This was prob one of the worst places I have ever been to . Walked in and it was completely dead I should've known this place was not a hit . Sat down without a warm welcome and just sitting and glancing at the utensils they literally had food on them and dried up stuff . I ordered a coffee and the cup had gross things in it . We ordered the hanger steak !!!! The worst tasting thing ever !!! I asked for medium well and it came burnt and the eggs were already popped and yolk all over my plate the hash browns were burned as well . My wife ordered pancakes to play it safe and they were raw in the middle and tasted like baking soda and water ! The syrup was stored in a open area ! I seriously don't know how this place past NYC food inspection\", u\"Absolutely love Kevin's . It's cozy and cute , and the food is full of flavor. Enjoyed dinner here on a Saturday night, started with the shrimp soup and mushroom tortellini appetizer (think that was a special) the food is fresh and the service is great! Great wine list to choose from . If you are in the area for your next date night , check this spot out.\", u'Delicious!!! We had lobster roll, angus steak, and typical two eggs brunch. Surprisingly, all of the pieces r super delicious! Coffee was perfect too! Yum yum yum!', u'We had a small wedding reception for friends here in December 2016, and I\\'ve been meaning to write a review to underscore just how wonderful everyone at Kevin\\'s was about organizing everything (we did the planning via Skype, since we no longer live in the city), and on the night itself. The food was amazing, the drinks affordable and good, and the atmosphere absolutely perfect. This is a fantastic venue to host any kind of private party, and, compared to a bunch of other places we approached for quotes, very reasonably priced too. You can bring in your own decorations on the day of the party, or, if (like us) you simply run out of time, the current decor they have there is perfectly fine and looks great on photos :) The staff and owners are incredibly professional and the whole experience was about as stress-free as I could have imagined. We chose the \"heavily passed tapas\" option (enough food that everyone felt entirely sated) and a two-hour open wine-and-beer bar, and had about 30 guests. You could also do a more formal sit-down dinner option if you prefer (and they have lots of options for drinks). \\n\\nPS: They have great karaoke at Hope & Anchor down the street if you\\'re looking for a spot to keep the party going afterwards.', u\"I live a block away from this place and have always thought this place look like a good restaurant. The food at Kevin's was great, but the waiter has an attitude problem. The single card payment policy is antiquated and unnecessary, and we witnessed a terse exchange between the waiter and the kitchen staff that probably shouldn't have happened during service.\", u'We live just a four minute walk away and have passed this place hundreds of times. We have always wanted to try it, but it\\'s always been empty so we were reluctant. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is quite quaint and sea themed. Loved the cute cups on the tables. Price is right for the entrees. \\n\\nHowever, the glassware was dirty and table wasn\\'t clean. Little hairs in the milk and grime on the French press. That\\'s fine I guess..maybe it\\'s part of the theme? Whatever. This wasn\\'t the worst part of our experience. \\n\\nI got the crab Benedict. The eggs weren\\'t runny like they should be and cooked through solid. The crab cakes were pretty good, not the best.  Our food was dry, under seasoned, and cold. Add some salt! \\n\\n I didn\\'t eat my side and let the waiter know that it was particularly cold. All he said was \"okay\" then walked away quickly and did not apologize or offer to fix it. Then he brought us the check. Very very rude. \\n\\nI wasn\\'t looking for a discount, which I probably should have received, but more of an apology or offer to warm the potatoes. This is really bad customer service. Too bad that we live so close, but will never return.\\n\\n come here if you want cold, mediocre food and bad service.', u\"Enjoyed the lovely service and good food at Kevin's. Friday night and you could hear yourself talk, the perk of Red Hook. Comfortable, cozy ambiance, just the right amount of attention, and right amount of people. Had the paella to share which was very filling after a shrimp chowder appetizer. It was perhaps not as flavorful as we would have liked but still very good. I surely recommend this place, whether date night, with family or friends.\", u\"OMG you MUST drop everything and go eat here. The food is PHENOMENAL. I had the steak, which was perfectly tender, and the scalloped potatoes are second to none. I also recommend the warm salad, which FINALLY had enough dressing to please me, after all these restaurants that seem to serve dry leaves. And the chocolate cake for dessert...I think I died and went to heaven. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Eat here, you won't regret it!!!\", u'Ok so we were one of the first tables to be seated but the last order to be taken. It was clear we were kind of being ignored but we tried to stay positive. We had a baby with us but thought it was relatively baby friendly since they had a high chair (I actually also called in advance to let them know) I asked for lemons (to occupy the baby who was well behaved but since everything was moving so slow I wanted to be prepared) It took 20 minutes for the lemons. I had to ask several times and eventually get up. When the lemons finally got there the baby ate them and dropped two on floor. I went to go pick them up but the server grabbed them before me and said nastily \"I\\'m too busy to be picking up lemons.\" This is the first time in our already 30 or so minutes in the restaurant that the baby dropped anything. My husband said \"we didn\\'t ask you to pick them up. We were getting them\" then he said with an even nastier tone \"well it\\'s my job to get them but I\\'m too busy and I cant\" and stormed off. So it was clear we weren\\'t wanted there so we walked out without our food. We are starving and disappointed. UPDATE: we got Chinese food and it was so much better than this could have ever been.'], u'93.Smile To Go': [u'Herby, crispy with\\nsoft mealy center are the\\nrotisserie spuds.\\n\\nPerfectly cooked, not \\ntoo mushy, soft and squishy--\\nshiitake quinoa.\\n\\nGreen and crunchy green\\nbeans were okay if you like\\nto eat vegetables.\\n\\nSquash was cooked well and \\ntastes great but maybe not washed \\nso great cuz lil grits.', u\"We stopped in here this afternoon on a break after a long walk to grab a pastry and coffee. The cookies looked amazing and I had a hard time choosing - ended up going with the halva cookie, which was rich and chocolatey without being too sweet. The topping was a mix of texture/taste between a crumble and a melty, sweet halva - really good, though maybe not something I'd seek out again unless I was in the area.\\n\\nThe iced coffee was really good (from someone who's picky about coffee!), though as a warning, their largest size is about akin to a Starbucks tall, though arguably better in quality and taste.\", u\"I love that DUMBO is getting a ton of new lunch options.\\n\\nSmile To Go is located inside Shinola watch store (also new), across from St Ann's Warehouse.\\n\\nThey do breakfast, sandwiches, and protein + sides. They also have an extensive drinks menu, including coffee.\\n\\nI went with the rotisserie chicken, which came with two market sides. I went with the roasted eggplant/cherry tomatoes salad and the quinoa with cheese. Pretty solid meal. The chicken portion was huge (basically a half chicken). Could've been a bit warmer and more spiced, but nothing a dab of hot sauce couldn't fix.\\n\\nLooking forward to returning. They also do coffee loyalty cards (buy 9, get 1 free), so I'll probably definitely be back for that!\\n\\nOh, and their cookies look dangerously delicious!\", u\"A new location of Smile To Go just opened in Dumbo, joining Cecconi's and VHH Foods right on the water for great places to eat with amazing views.\\n\\nThey have the same great healthier sandwiches and salad options here, but for me it's all about their amazing cookies. The Chocolate Chip Sea Salt and Chocolate Halva Cookies are absolute must tries, up there with the best cookies in NYC, and worth coming here for alone.\\n\\nGrab some food and take it to the water right near Jane's Carousel for a great lunch.\", u\"Excellent coffee. I didn't even need to add sugar. Way better than Brooklyn coffee roasters. Also the sea salt chocolate chunk cookie was outstanding!  I would definitely go back. They had a really interesting selection of baked goods and veggies etc.\", u'This place is pretty good - expensive, but most places in this area are ($15 for a small side, 1/2 a sandwich, and a seltzer). The chicken with two sides is good and they change their sides daily for variety. Every employee I\\'ve encountered is generally a pleasure to interact with BUT I do want to call out one very rude employee today who was treating the customer ahead of me like a piece of garbage. He had simply ordered a plate of chicken with sides, and she was rushing him, mumbling a reply, and when he asked her what she had said, she yells, \"I SAID: IS THAT ALL YOU ARE GETTING? IF SO STEP ASIDE!\" There wasnt even a line. I felt bad for him, especially because he was startled by her reaction (as was I). I\\'m glad someone else came up to take my order. \\n\\nSmile To Go Mgmt: You should address this employee\\'s attitude..it could lose business!', u\"This is a solid location for delicious and healthy food to go in DUMBO. I appreciate that it is somewhat hidden inside the Shinola store because it's not particularly crowded, which will probably change as the store becomes more popular. Their veggie sides are always on point, and the sandwiches and rotisserie items are mouthwatering as well. Most importantly, there's a wide variety of items for people of various dietary preferences to try; they label their menu to indicate what dishes are vegan, dairy free, and gluten free, which is always a treat. Lastly, the staff members are friendly, approachable, and so helpful! Keep up the good work!\"], u'173.Popina': [u\"Came here last night with in a group of three people.. The room was warm and comfortable with a sophisticated vibe..  I was very excited to try this restaurant..  Perhaps it was because I knew the crew were Danny Meyer Alum, perhaps I knew about the chef's pedigree or the fact that I was prepared to check out what is arguably the best wine list in Brooklyn right now..  But, I was not disappointed despite my anticipation.. \\n\\nWe did not have a reservation last night so we had to wait a bit in their huge backyard.. Complete with bocce court!!!  After a quick google search, the wife and I taught ourselves had to play a quick version of bocce ball and we sat with a couple of cocktails and played on their bocce court.. \\n\\nThe cocktail was fantastic by the way.. It was a whiskey drink with all of the things I like about a negroni and then they kicked it up with some whiskey instead of gin.  \\n\\nAgain, i said the wine list is fantastic and I really meant it.. James is the wine guy and he was able to recommend and help us work our way through.. We started with a bottle of Montevertine 2014.. I normally don't remember bottles when I am drinking but, this stood out as exceptional and committed it to memory.. \\n\\nWe moved on to Arancini which were really delicious.  Normally arancine is made with arborio rice which is starchy and creamy.. Here they used white gold rice which allowed the grains to keep their integrity.. I was starving and this was a great way to start.  This is definitely worth a crack. \\n\\nThey also make their own foccacia in house. .This was served with a whipped lardo. The foccai was fantastic. I often find it boring, this was nothing short of fantastic. it was cripsy and freshly made and so good.. \\n\\nWe almost ordered all the pastas but, we landed on three.. Two spaghettis and a house made thick pappardelle with braised pieces of ham hock in a delicious broth/sauce.  The sauce interacted with the pappardelle so beautifully.  It was a thing of beauty.. While all the pastas were great, one with truffles another with onions, this was my personal favorite.. A good thing is when there is no clear definite winning dish and my wife was happy to finish the onions spaghetti as that was her favorite. .\\n\\nWe moved on to swordfish over creamed lettuces and their hot chicken milanese.. I think it's a genius idea and it was executed exactly how you would hope it to be.. Served with a raddicchio salad that we loved.. \\n\\nFor dessert we had chocolate cake which i am rarely impressed with.. This cake was almost like a flourless chocolate cake or a rich gooey brownie.. \\n\\nWe finished with some beautiful cheeses from Abruzzo and some more wine.. \\n\\nStaff was friendly and informed.. It's shocking how well this place is operating considering it's so young.  I can't wait to go back.  I wish this place was in my neighborhood though, it's still worth it for me to travel back to.\", u\"This is a new spot combining American Southern cooking with Italian cooking in a really nice spot on that quiet strip where Pok Pok kills it and everything else new closes quickly (most recently Carla Hall's Southern Kitchen).\\n\\nIt's actually a pretty small restaurant, but the backyard patio is huge and one of the best in NYC, as it is also equipped with a big bocce court. They don't actually serve dinner out there, but they do serve drinks and dessert, similar to Olmsted.\\n\\nService was great, but most importantly the food was all excellent. It's a short menu with four starters, four pastas, two entrees and two desserts. We started with the Arancini ($7 for 4), Burrata ($16) and Pork Meatballs ($14). The most standout fusion aspect of these was the Arancini coated in honey and butter and filled with gold rice, which were also the best of these three, though the meatballs were great too.\\n\\nFor the pastas, we got the Linguine ($18) and the Cavatelli ($17). While both were great, the Linguine was definitely the standout and the must try. The other must was the Hot Chicken Milanese ($23), which is nice and crispy with a really good amount of kick.\\n\\nWe tried the Citrus Custard ($9) for dessert, but unfortunately the Chocolate Chess Pie you might have also seen in previews wasn't available. I would definitely come back for that and some of the other pastas.\", u'Great service! Had the arancini as an appetizer, and pappardelle pasta as the main (split it with my girlfriend). That was enough for the both of us! Meal was delicious - pasta was cooked perfectly -- the wide pasta noodles with the light sauce and ham hock meat was delightful. We also got cocktails with dinner; they were refreshing as well. GREAT place for a date night or to catch up with a friend in an intimate setting.', u\"Food is excellent and prices are not close to bad for the quality of what you get. The tomatoes with the burrata where the simply fenomenal, the absolute best, fresh and natural. Swordfish was cooked to perfection and the combination of flavors was original and exquisite. And the clam toast, genius. The tastiest pasta with tomato sauce I ever had (cavatelli). The chess pie...genius again. Loved everything of it. If there's a negative point, to\\nhelp you guys grow: give those kids a better and more organized service training. I can't wait to come back to try more things.\", u\"Awesome food and service. If you're in the area, hell even if you're not in the area...get Popina on your list!\", u\"Popina has the potential to be great. The space is great. The French restaurant that used to be here was a neighborhood staple before the waterfront became a destination. Management needs to figure out the front-of-house operations. It's chaotic and the person behind the bar is rude. Sure, it just opened so here's hoping things will change. I certainly hope so and will enthusiastically change my review if that's the case. But at this price point and considering the legacy of the people involved, you don't expect JV squad. You expect the best and the brightest. You expect major leagues. Here's hoping you get there, Popina.\"], u'22.Buttermilk Channel': [u\"So last Saturday I died and went to brunch heaven!!! Literally. I had one of the best brunches I've had in a long time. It was one of those experiences that had me smiling and rubbing my belly all day.\\n\\nFor quite some time now I've wanted to try buttermilk channel but walking by and seeing the weekend line has made me shy of the situation. I decided to finally give it a go as I couldn't resist their photos here on yelp.\\n\\nI came on a Saturday and showed up around 12:15pm. I was told it would take about 40 minutes to be seated which I was fine with this time around, I gave them my number and they said they would text when a table is available. About fifteen minutes later I got a text and bam I was in! So just a tip, give it a try you may get a table sooner than the expected wait time.\\n\\nI ended up ordering the pancakes, the short rib hash and a sticky bun. To be honest after I ordered I was worried I chose the wrong thing as the amazing french toast kept being served around me, (next time I'm trying it for sure it looks incredible)\\n\\nWell, let's just say I was not disappointed at all!\\n\\nWhere do I start?....\\n\\nThe sticky bun was sooo good. It was not too swee,t so it was enjoyable every single bite. It was soft chewy and had just the right amount of icing on it.\\n\\nThe short rib hash, it was more than I expected. Loads of short rib with hints of potatoes here and there served with a bed of greens and mini toasts topped with two sunny side up eggs. I can still taste it now, it was so flavorful and everything on the plate complimented one another \\n\\nThe pancakes....three fluffy, buttery fresh cakes served with the lightest and most perfect syrup I could have imagined. They were probably the best pancakes I've had.\\n\\nAll in all I will 100 percent be back, probably in a few days as I can't wait too long to experience the goodness again\\n\\nAlso, the staff were all very nice!\\n\\nOh wait....i also got a side of bacon.....best bacon ever!!! Really balances out the sweetness from the pancakes and the sticky bun\", u'Just had brunch here with my boyfriend. He\\'s been here once before a few years back. He told me it wasn\\'t as great as everyone said it was but wanted me to judge for myself. Especially since I had this place bookmarked for sometime now. So we finally went today..\\n\\nThe woman put in our name & told us a 30min wait or more but they will text us when a table is ready. It was pretty hot & since they only had 2 fans going we decided to go cool down somewhere else. We went about 5 blocks away to get some orgaic juices. 45 min past, no text so we decided to walk back. The woman must have forgotten b/c when she saw us, she reacted as if we just walked in for the first time, she got us a table though. So always check in, don\\'t rely on that text, you may not get it. \\n\\nI\\'ve read about the sticky walnut bun, so l ordered that & my boyfriend asks what l thought. I said it\\'s dry, too much cinnamon & no walnuts & barely any glaze. He said \"that\\'s exactly what l thought when l ordered it last time l was here\". So strike 1.\\n\\nWe ordered coffee & an iced coffee (if they had simple syrup to sweeten up the iced coffee). The simple syrup looked like water (not syrupy like it should hence the name). I had tasted my coffee before l used that & before l poured in the milk. It tasted horrible so l thought let me add those & see if it still sucked.. it did. I asked my boyfriend what he thought of his coffee, he says \"it\\'s really weak & tastes bad\" so we called our waiter over & had him take\\'em back & we just stuck with water. Strike 2!\\n\\nThen l ordered their popular Pecan Pie French Toast, which was not bad, although mine had a smoky bacon taste to it so l\\'m assuming they put it on the same stove plate as someone\\'s bacon. Not good for Vegetarians! *So you Vegetarians beware*. Still not bad & definitely better than that sticky bun! The Bf had 2 poached eggs on ham & toast w/a side of salad. He said the poached eggs were over done & the whole thing just tasted mediocre. \\n\\nWhere are all these great reviews coming from??\\n\\nI went online for the bathroom at the end of our meal, the line was in view of the kitchen & l saw one of the chefs (who had a long beard but NO BEARD NET, yuck)...he grabbed a pancake (with his bare hands)..from a pile of an already cooked pancakes to heat up. l guess for whoever ordered pancakes, l\\'m glad l didn\\'t order those! \\n\\nWe definitely wouldn\\'t come back, especially with that long of a wait, to be let down with the food. I gave the 2nd star only for ambiance & decent french toast.', u\"I had my birthday dinner here, and all of us loved our food! Great for groups, and they brought out a pecan pie sundae thing with candles for me that was honestly amazing. \\n\\nI've also brunched here, and it is a great spot for people watching and petting cute neighborhood dogs. Definitely a great spot to hit up in Carroll Gardens!\", u'Overall Buttermilk Channel provides a pretty good dining experience. \\n\\nMy wife and I visited shortly after opening one day because I read that they can be a line outside depending on when you visit so we wasted no time. Buttermilk Channel has been in my bookmarks for a while and so I was amped up about this meal. \\n\\nWalked in we were greated by a friendly hostess who showed us to our seat and followed by our waiter. Menu was provided and we ordered. I got the fried chicken that was raved about in the reviews along with a side of fries. To drink I had a beer off tap. \\n\\nWhen my meal came out it not only caught my eyes but also the family who was just seated next to us. Presentation is perfect. Food was amazing. I was so full I even had to get a take home box. I definitely recommend the fried chicken meal when visiting but other items on the menu also sound amazing. \\n\\nFour stars instead of five because they can surely improve on the sauce that comes with the fried chicken and the menu prices that surely did add up.', u'Brooklyn should be proud of this restaurant! Really nice place to mingle with friends!\\n\\nLocation: It is a 5 minute walk from the subway, G or F train is the closest one. The interior is nice, not too fancy. Also it is good for groups. There is also outdoor seating.\\n\\nService: The server is very nice! Eventhough it is only 3 of them they handle it well. We got seated immediately.\\n\\nFood: The food is really good! Let me start with the house made ricotta, I love the pecans on top of the ricotta, the bread is a little bit dry but it is okay. Second is the Buttermilk fried chicken sandwich, OMG it is so huge and two breast part, the chicken is very crispy and inside is moist and juicy, it has coleslaw as well, the bread is soft, too huge that I took home the rest. The dessert is banana pudding and pecan pie sundae. The banana pudding is just okay for me, it is like a puree banana with cream and popcorn, too sweet for my palate. The pecan pie is good, with ice cream in it.\\n\\nHuge servings for the money! Good food as well! A must visit restaurant in Brooklyn!', u\"Pecan Pie French Toast....I cannot get the taste of the Pecan Pie French Toast off of my mind. Yes, that is how I am choosing to start this review. Why you may ask?...Because that is exactly how delicious the french toast tasted while having Brunch at Buttermilk Channel!-lol. It was the epitome of food greatness but I will come back to that in a bit....\\n\\nButtermilk Channel is located in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn which is quite a quiet and neighborly place. We decided to come here for brunch after I went on Yelp and saw all of the fantastic looking food in people's postings. Once we arrived at Buttermilk Channel, we were definitely able to confirm not only great looking but fabulously smelling food! I will never be able to verbalize just how wonderful the aromas were that emanated from the various dishes. All we did was ooh and aah at every single plate that went by us....It is a true testament to them having a extraordinary selection of options on their brunch menu!\\n\\nThe friendly hostess informed us that we will have to wait about 30 minutes, however we were probably seated in about 15 minutes which was nice. Buttermilk staff provided prompt service as we received water, napkins etc. quickly. Thanks to Allison and Laura for being so lovely!\\n\\nOk....so I had the Pecan Pie French Toast w / side of bacon. I have to give Kudos to Chef Chris because that Pecan Pie French Toast is two of the best tasting buttery pieces of french toast that I have ever had! Crispy around the edges and soft, fluffy goodness in the middle. Oh my.....the syrup and marvelous pecans that complimented the french toast made it perfection throughout each and every bite! I was also told about and got to taste some of Buttermilk Pancakes....Spectacular! The Bacon went well with the French toast. \\n\\nWe had such a pleasurable experience...I need some more of that Pecan Pie French Toast in my life!-lol\", u'I heart this place!  We needed a kid friendly place with amazing food and came here! The staff was attentive and patient with our little one.  Children have a kids meal as well. The cheeseburger is amazing! \\n\\nWe enjoyed a glass of rose with out fried chicken and duck meatloaf! Holy cow the entrees were delicious!  My meatloaf was moist and the corn complemented the dish well!', u\"My hubby and I decided to pop into Buttermilk Channel on Labor Day 2017. Off the back I could tell it was going to be a pleasant experience. Every staff member that we encountered was professional, more particularly our waitress, who was very patient as my husband roamed the menu for 15 minutes trying to decide what to order. On the other hand I knew I wanted chicken and waffle no sides no appetizers and a glass of wine to tingle my taste buds. For the price the chicken and waffle portion is appropriate. The waffle itself is out of this world delicious: Seriously, my waffle was so good I couldn't wait to bite into it again and again, and was sad once I had eaten it all up. The chicken on the other hand was alright. Overall a very solid experience!\", u\"Returned for dinner with three friends and had an epic meal. First, I'd recommend bringing as many people as possible and sharing everything. We had the chicken and waffles, mushroom barley burger, market vegetable bowl, a pasta special with red pepper and pork, flatbread special with ricotta, spinach and mushroom, plus the pecan pie sundae and apple galette for dessert. The chicken is a must - perfectly cooked and served with amazing coleslaw and cheddar waffles - but everything else that I tried was also incredible. The ice cream here is Van Leeuwen (one of my favorite ice cream spots) so we got to enjoy that in our sundae, which paired nicely with our hot apple dessert. Would give this place 6 stars if I could.\\n\\nNote to self: return to try the duck meatloaf and pork chop that everyone's going on about.\\n\\nEdit 6/2017:\\n\\nBrunch was just as great this time! I repeated my order and added a side of biscuits as well. They were awesome but definitely not necessary on top of everything else. Fried pork chop and cheddar waffles were simply phenomenal, as was the eggs and hash dish.\", u\"Came for lunch with my significant other. We ordered the pickles as a snack and it was a weird flavored pickle. My boyfriend didn't really like it. We also ordered the avocado toast and that was good but the bread was too fluffy. I think it would've tasted a lot better if it was thin and crunchy. We shared the French fries which was amazing, each fry was thin and crunchy, just the way I love it! I had the chicken sandwich and I absolutely loved it. I was wowed at how much flavor the chicken had even after being fried. The sandwich itself was definitely a 5. My boyfriend had the grilled cheese without apples. It was about a 3. The price was right, definitely worth it. The waiter was friendly and attentive. Definitely a place to check out!\", u\"It was definitely lived up to its hype. Pro tip would be to get there early. I got lucky and arrived before a whole cluster of people. I love a good Bloody Mary and they had great options. My friends and I shared some plates like the brisket hash. I had the the pork chops with a side of poached eggs and I don't have enough words to describe how tasty and perfect it was. The service was pleasant and speedy despite how busy it was, everyone seemed to be in a good mood. Everything about the decor was simple and perfect, clean and elegant. You must come here early, go get coffee across the street and wait till your table is ready. It's worth the wait\", u\"Came here for brunch and it was okay. I ordered the French toast with a side of bacon. The menu didn't seem enticing like how everyone mentioned so I ordered what I thought was safe.\", u\"My friend and I decided to go here on a whim because we couldn't decide where to eat brunch on Saturday afternoon. We usually grab food in the city but since we were both already in Brooklyn, we saw how many reviews this place got and wanted to try it out for ourselves.\\n\\nBecause it was freezing outside, we only had to wait 20-30 minutes, but we were immediately greeted and felt welcome. The host and servers were really sweet even though it's probably always hella packed which made for a great experience.\\n\\nI got the pork chop and cheddar waffles. AMAZING. This dish made Buttermilk my top brunch spot. My friend got their version of lox benedict and she thought it was good, but i found it too salty and buttery. \\n\\nThen we shared some buttermilk pancakes because... that's the name of the restaurant sooooo duh. We were not at all disappointed. They were super fluffy and delicious and legit soaked up all the syrup mad quick. \\n\\nI will say the portions were good and worth the price, since it's average NYC brunch prices. Coffee is free refills, which is pretty great too, and rare for where we are.\\n\\nAnd shoutout to Samuel. Great guy!\\n\\nCan't wait for an excuse to come back here again.\", u'Went here at 6:30pm on Saturday and was not totally crowded yet. The atmosphere inside and outside is really comforting. My buddy and I chose to sit at the bar. We ordered the Scallops special, house bacon with figs and sea bass dish. We replaced the meatloaf after finding it too salty. The waiter was a really nice gentleman. When the dish was too salty, he helped us replace it with another dish, the sea bass. My favorite dish of the night was the scallops special with couscous and eggplant sauce. It was really yummy. Highly recommend that dish. Also, parking was easy to find at this restaurant and the restaurant replaces your plate and utensils after every dish. I like this restaurant and want to come back to try the Fried Buttermilk chicken dish next time.', u\"Get the maple and bacon roasted almonds. They're so yummy! Really enjoyed brunch here. This place has a great laid back vibe. Got the fried porkchop and cheddar waffle. So good! I would come back to try more! And get more of those maple bacon almonds! Drool\", u\"The food was great.... I mean that's what you want to hear right? Oh you want me to be more descriptive... gotcha. So Buttermilk Channel is an amazing breakfast, brunch and dinner restaurant. It's has a hipster vibe to it. Everyone looks so artsy but with great food on your table your tunnel vision sets in and before you know it.... wham! Your gut is full and you want the check so you could go home lay down and dream about those awesome pancakes you devoured. Great place it's a must try!\", u'Not just another brunch restaurant in the Park Slope/Carroll Gardens neighborhoods.\\n\\nHaving now been here twice for brunch, with both experiences with the food being just as good as the other, I officially give my nod of approval for the brunch experience here. In my recent visit with my girlfriend, we visited on New Year\\'s Day for brunch. Surprise, surprise -- unlike many businesses where the employees are catching up on their sleep from the previous evening\\'s debauchery, Buttermilk Channel is up and running for brunch from 11am-3pm!\\n\\nOn New Year\\'s Day, most of the businesses were closed around the area so it was pretty much an errie and unusually quiet day in the neighborhood .... except for Buttermilk Channel where it was bustling with a pack of hungry (potentially hungover) customers. We put our name/phone number on their waiting list and received a text from them when our table was ready, which was about in 1 hour. Not too bad for a wait considering we arrived at around 1pm.\\n\\nWhen we walked in, the restaurant was indeed alive and well with brunch lovers alike. We were seated promptly, with which I immediately noticed how close the tables were scrunched up next to each other. A little breathing room between tables would have definitely been appreciated, but we didn\\'t let that tidbit ruin our brunch at all.\\n\\nFrom my previous experience and current knowledge of the more popular brunch dishes here, my girlfriend and I went with the Fried Pork Chop & Cheddar Waffles, the Eggs Huntington .... and, for good measure, the Pecan Pie French Toast to shre. Honestly, I don\\'t know what we were thinking, but we were in a really good mood so we completely obliterated one New Year\\'s resolution just like that.\\n\\nEGGS HUNTINGTON\\nThis was my main entree and it was a bit disappointing. Just like my 1st time here, it was nothing more than an Eggs Benedict to me. The poached eggs were good and it spilled all over the buttermilk biscuits beautifully, but it left me wanting more. It was just \"OK\" to me. Eggs Benedict lovers will love it, but I\\'m more of a hearty breakfast person.\\n\\nFRIED PORK CHOP & CHEDDAR WAFFLES\\nThis was my girlfriend\\'s entree and it was absolutely a winner! I had this the 1st time I came here too and the pork chop was fried thoroughly, but the meat itself was tender, juicy and savory. It didn\\'t hurt that there was maple syrup to not only pour onto the waffles, but also onto the pork chop. Each bite of pork chop, waffle and syrup was a bite of heaven.\\n\\nPECAN PIE FRENCH TOAST\\nThis one was the wild card, but overall it delivered. The pieces of french toast were huge and sat in a river of really sweet, but savory syrup. We didn\\'t touch it for the 1st few minutes, which was a mistake. Although the french toast was very good, it was also very sweet and got a bit soggy because it sat in the syrup for too long. If you have a sweet tooth though, then this dish is clearly for you. It has all the components in it to melt your teeth like a sugar cane.\\n\\nTo close, the service was quick and prompt and our waiter came back to fill our coffee and water. The food took a bit long to come out, not only for us, but also for the table next to us. To me, it was a bit too loud for brunch as all of the conversations were bouncing off of the walls making it difficult for me to hear my girlfriend talk. However, the food was good and the place was really pumping, which is a good sign of success. Not sure if we\\'d be back here again for brunch since there are just so many options in the area, but it\\'s a great choice for any one who hasn\\'t been.', u'I ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich. Very crispy on the outside tender and juicy on the inside. The staff is friendly even though they are always busy.', u\"Just returned from the quickest dine-in solo brunch. Not because of anything in regards to the restaurant... I guess except for the volume levels of conversational patrons and tight bar seating. After all, it is midday Saturday brunch service.\\n\\nOnward to the food... I've been meaning to visit this place for quite a long time. Luckily, I now live nearby. I woke up this morning with a craving for American food, so I decided to give it a go. I ordered the Eggs Huntington and a side of Cheddar Waffles. It was good. You can definitely taste the freshness and vibrancy of the ingredients; the delicious buttermilk of both the biscuits and waffles; the richness of the eggs and hollandaise; and the beautifully light, tangy dressing on the greens. I commend them for sourcing locally and ethically, which probably justifies the price. The plates came kind of room temperature, though.\\n\\nThe service was okay. The hostess was quite lovely. The light-skinned server at the bar, not so much. I guess that's hipster Carroll Gardens for ya!\\n\\nWould I return? Perhaps. Not for a while though. This introvert descended from immigrants doesn't crave American food that often.\\n\\nPS: Kudos to whoever decided this brisk pre-autumn day needed some All Things Must Pass.\", u'Guys this review is SO LATE. We had a gorgeous brunch at Buttermilk Channel  on December 4th 2016, after an all-nighter that began with a light supper at The Good Fork, a Bon Iver Show at Pioneer Works, and then a late night dinner at Prime Meats, followed by hours of whiskey and cards until day broke. I haven\\'t written about this experience because the whole time is sort of blurred together as one contiguous hedonistic stream and maybe I\\'ve only just recently recovered from the epic hangover I accomplished but don\\'t judge y\\'all ok? \\n\\nA Bloody Mary or two, the morning after a big night, fixes all. And when the Marys are freshly made, stuffed with crispy, salty and assertively flavored garnishes, served with compassion and tenderness, one\\'s faith that another day will be had is restored all that more quickly. I know you\\'re nodding. I know you\\'ve been there. \\n\\nAfter a brief wait (because we chose to eat at the bar, if you\\'re targeting a table, be prepared for a longer wait), we each ordered a Classic Bloody Mary and got to feeling human as we chose our mains. I had the house-cured lox plate because I\\'m a sucker for fried capers yet had I been feeling less \"fragile\" I would have ponied up to the warm lamb & romaine salad with roasted cauliflower and olive croutons--because you guys FRIED CAPERS!!! are featured in that dish as well. As it stood, I needed something that had nursery elements like rye toast and cream cheese. Good grief it was delicious. The fish was delicately cured and served with said fried capers and a few tomato and red onion slices. By this time I was having coffee and smiling brightly. All was well. \\n\\nMy dining companion chose the Eggs Huntington because he is completely focused on biscuits. Perhaps a little obsessed with biscuits, if I\\'m to be honest. Anyway. Who am I to judge? \\n\\nFriends, when Hollandaise is made well it\\'s glorious, right? Sunshine-y gold, silken and just a tiny bit sharp, either with lemon or white wine, emulsified into melted butter, yolks, a splash of water and a bit of white pepper. Guys. The Buttermilk Channel Hollandaise is the Daenarys of all Hollandaises. This sauce was so fierce two additional sides of it were ordered. Two. And were eaten with a spoon. Also, the eggs were poached perfectly so the yolks spilled over just as they should on the generous serving of ham. This is not a dish for a weak appetite, be warned. And you must speak \"biscuit\" to do it justice because otherwise what is the point? \\n\\nA few words on ordering: we noticed that people were not fooling around here. This is a multiple dishes kind of place. The couple next to us had three sides, three mains, a couple coffees and were making steady work of what seemed to be a pipeline of martinis, while softly discussing desert choices. #Goals, right?!  What I\\'m saying here is that even though there are salad options to be had, one comes here to get one\\'s eat on. It\\'s expected. I suppose we were sort of disappointment to our server as we didn\\'t order desert, but come to think of it, we ran hard with the double Hollandaise sides so I believe we scraped by with a modicum of BMC brunch dignity. \\n\\nBtw, the vibe is very pleasant. The service is super efficient and cheerful and the clientele bond together united in the sheer joy of tucking into what I think is one of the best brunches in town. Can\\'t wait to go back for that warm lamb and romaine salad (with fried capers!) after a full night\\'s sleep. Maybe see you there!'], u'141.Juniper': [u\"Came here to eat the other day with my husband and sister. It may not look like much but the food is amazing!!!! I had the truffle burger, my husband had the smoked BBQ rib sandwich and my sister had a special that day, the shrimp po boy. We couldn't stop saying how amazing our food was! My burger bun was somehow soft on the outside and crispy on the inside. \\n\\nThey have a nice little patio space as well and this is cash only! It also seems you can BYOB and pay a corking fee. We liked it so much that we came back the next night for dinner.\", u'great casual environment with lovely service. \\nbyob is a plus....corkage fee: 1$ for a beer, 3$ for larger beer, and 5$ wine bottle, 10$ for big wine bottle. very fair. \\nhad the cobb salad, which was really good. it is super mellow and casual, so great! after a long work week.\\nthe staff is super nice and welcoming.', u\"I've been here twice. The food is good. Both times I've gotten the truffle burger and sweet potato fries. Both times I was very pleased with the quality of food.\\n\\nThe place is a bit tight and small, not much luck if you're more than 2 people on a busy day. They also only accept cash and have an ATM in the place.\", u'Great place for lunch/brunch in Williamsburg. It is small but cozy. All dishes were really good, big and good price. I had the cobb salad, which was really good, and the sandwiches looked really tasty too. The only downside is that it took them a long time to bring the food, and they only accept cash.', u\"Hidden gem in Brooklyn. We found juniper on yelp and wanted to return the favor with an additional great review. I had a burger and my 12 year old had the chicken fingers. Both were super tasty. But can we talk about how amazing the fries were? I know fries are super simple but these were way above any expectation. So be advised- you're going to want a refill on the fries. The food is definitely the highlight. Other than that it was a quaint little place with a chill ambience and a convenient location- perfect for lunchtime or an afternoon date. We will definitely be back and I recommend that you check it out too!\", u'Came here for dinner! The lady who waited on us was super sweet! I really enjoy eating somewhere where the people are pleasant and food is good! Ordered their nightly special jerk chicken salad. It was super yummy! The chicken was spicy and I love spicy foods! Price is very reasonable. Will definitely come back again!!', u\"Excellent fish and chips - cute place great for avoiding the brunch crowds.\\n\\nI came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday for brunch and it was great! No wait to get a table and the food was delicious. We both had the fish and chips, which was delicious and made with catfish. However, portions are HUGE and I would highly recommend sharing this entr\\xe9e and getting another appetizer to share instead. I tried the spicy chips (fries)- also great. They don't serve cocktails here but do have flavored ginger ales which were tasty and house white and red wine. \\n\\nService was great but beware this place is cash only, so come prepared. Overall a great experience. Can't wait to come back!\", u'Pretty average overall...\\nThey have a nice interior garden and it is a BYOB (paying a corkage price) :-)\\nFood: I had chicken fingers, which were pretty goid not dry at all.\\nMy hubbie had pulled pork sandwich, which was huge with a lot of pork. It was ok.\\nFries were delicious.', u\"3.5 to be exact.  I'll round up for the antique cash register!\\n\\nI was looking for a delicious burger in this area one night and stumbled upon Juniper.  This establishment is a small place, but do not let that scare you from coming here.  The service was good and I had a great meal here.\\n\\nThere is an old school feel about this place, as they are CASH ONLY and have an antique cash register that actually looks pretty cool.  Like I mentioned previously, there are only a few tables and seats inside.  There is an area in the back you can sit, which truly looks just like a patio of a person's home.  I would not mind sitting out there during a nice day.\\n\\nThe burger I got here, the Truffle Burger was good. Of course it was a burger with truffle oil, but the meat was juicy and full of flavor!  I also got it with spicy fries which were great! They were crispy and not overly seasoned.  \\n\\nThe menu here is pretty interesting and for a small place they have some good items to try, which in my eyes, makes it worth coming back here!\", u'Good spot. I had a rare burger with bacon, a salad and no bun. Their french fries were eh- I had sweet potato fries and my friend had regular fries. They were vaguely crispy on the outside, soft on the inside but not browned or caramelized anywhere to give them that extra depth of flavor- they were also dry! Not hard or uncooked, but dry on the outside. My burger was juicy and flavorful! and they have great cheddar cheese. spring mix was served with a basic balsamic which was lovely. Our waitress was a delight, but one of the guys working (yes working!) behind the bar seemed a little buzzed and was kinda disruptive. All in all we had a fantastic dinner and were allowed to sit and relax after our meal without being rushed out. 4 stars!!', u\"Great food but felt snubbed by staff- the waitress totally forgot part of my order, and the owner didn't acknowledge our presence at all even though there were only two groups present (including my group) and sat facing sideways to my partner and I without any word the entire 40 or so minutes we were there. Felt really rude and provinicial-y. Food was good though - service gave me good reason to seamless this place next time.\", u'So. So. good!!!  The woman who sat us was incredibly sweet and knew the details of the menu like the back of her hand. The food came out quickly and was delicious. BYOB all day. A great restaurant to grab a bite with a friend or small group.', u\"Ordered the truffle burger, medium rare again! However this time with gouda cheese. Amazing like the first time I ate here. Same $5 corkage fee for when you BYOB. There is a liquor shop across the street. This time around when we came here it was not as busy, so we got our food in a timely manner.\\n\\nBURGER WAS SO JUICY! Sweet potato fries were made with fresh sweet potatoes and nicely fried. Cajun fries were nicely tossed to have seasoning to evenly coat each fry! One slice of gouda cheese, honestly that's all I need, I don't want the cheese to overpower the bun nor burger.\", u'A destination eatery (BYOB) not to be missed when visiting this neighborhood. Tom and Lilly are very gracious and the food is terrific and consistent!  Try the fish and chips, slow cooked BBQ rib sandwich, sliders, fries, eggplant parmesan  and jambalaya.\\nThe old cash register and a recent hanging of art photos reflect some of the urban decay seen in the neighborhood and throughout NYC.', u\"Your gonna get into some fancy burger dining here at Juniper I got the chorizo burger It's twenty percent chorizo but it's still good and tasty it's one of those five napkin burgers the ones that get your hands all wet and drippy. Don't forget the spicy cajun fries they have the regular fries and sweet potato fries if your a sweet potato kind of person.\\n\\nNice cozy spot for a five napkin kind of burger.\", u\"I had heard amazing things about this place! I thought everything was good but maybe it didn't live up to the hype. I came mainly for the Cajun sausage and seafood pasta but I found it had too much pepper. I split the pasta and the truffle burger with a friend. I liked the burger but it was not 'memorable' necessarily.\", u\"Wings were gigantic, perfect amount of sauce (and good flavor, seems like they doctored up Frank's to make it even better so good on them). \\n\\nThe Burger was above average.  The bun was excellent (reminded me of a Fudruckers bun.) \\n\\nI sat at the bar by myself and was helped right away. The server told me to put my order in before hopping over to the ATM on the block to make sure my order wouldn't take too long. \\n\\nI would definitely recommend.\", u\"I went to Juniper with my friends Sal and Angela. Tommy was so welcoming and kind. We ordered some BBQ wings. They were large and delicious. I ordered a truffle burger. And my goodness...it was absolute bliss. Also it's byob so that's dope as well. \\n\\nBut wait. The MAC AND CHEESE was the best I've ever had. It was creamy and delicious. \\n\\nI will be back soon. I love the place.\", u\"The food is pretty good, but we had a very scary allergy issue with the food here.\\nWe asked the restaurant about allergy ingredients and were informed that all were okay. However, when our toddler ate the short rib burger he had severe allergy reactions.  He is allergic to peanuts.\\n\\nIf you are allergic to peanuts, avoid this place. I am still shocked that they don't even know what's in their bbq sauce as I am pretty sure that the sauce was the issue.\", u\"I only eat the pulled pork sandwich here...over and over again. It's just really good. Love the BYOB and the owner is super friendly and super cool and social. \\nIt's not a fancy place, but it does the trick being a homey neighborhood resto.\"], u'143.Bravi Ragazzi': [u\"This is MY FAVORITE PIZZA PLACE IN NYC. \\n\\nAnd I'm born and raised in NYC so that holds extra weight (JK). \\n\\nI stumbled across it when I was in the area.\\n\\nOf course one type of pizza isn't perfect for everyone, but the personal Margherita pie I got knocked it out of the park with everything I love. It had a thin, chewy crust. It was just burnt enough in all the perfect places. The crust was not sweet.\\n\\nPlus Mike was awesome and treats all the customers so well. Plus I liked the music. \\n\\nPerfect pizzeria experience.\", u\"Our newest family go-to spot, and another feather in Bed-Stuy's cap, Bravi Ragazzi managed to put the freshest pizza on our table in a New York minute. (That's also about how long it took us to inhale their signature pie, so we followed up with another Margherita for good measure.)\\n\\n90s R&B playlist had us singing along to every song, which may also have been encouraged by our $5 glasses of wine at Happy Hour. Super chill spot that we have every intention of bringing all our friends to--be that the homies, or all the parents and kids at our school bus stop. Date night? Yup. Solo lunch special at $8? Yup.\\n\\nWe hope they knock the scaffolding down outside the building they're in so more people can see that they're open for business, because this is a neighborhood gem that deserves support.\", u'Welcome to the neighborhood !\\nWe had a wonderful time and tasty pizzas. \\nDan was very friendly and led us to the best choice.\\nWe will definitely be back soon and recommend this spot to our neighbors : )', u'Delicious!!!! Pizza!!! Very unique feel inside and the guy who helped us was very welcoming!!', u'I\\'m italian and I\\'ve tried a lot of pizza places in New York City, looking for the perfect \"melts in the mouth\" pizza. Well, I finally found it \\n\\nBravi Ragazzi is hands down the best Neapolitan pizza in NYC! A perfect dough, perfect sauce and fresh toppings make their pizza a delicious treat! \\nI tried few different pies, burrata, bruschetta, nutella pizza; everything is just so simple, tasty and flavorful, and REALLY AUTHENTIC! I had a similar experience only in Napoli! \\n\\nThe only problem? You can get addicted:)\\nGo and try yourself, you won\\'t be disappointed', u'Nice and friendly place where u can smell the same atmosphere that you can smell in Italy when you going in the pizzeria. The pizza is amazing and you can choose between so many toppings. \\nLove it', u'We walked by on a Friday night and decided to take a chance. We are so glad we did! I love pizza, particular Neapolitan style crust, so I was in heaven. A fantastic blend of classic technique with new world toppings, and clever pizza names. High quality, not pretentious, and friendly service. (And an awesome happy hour, I noticed). Mason got the 99 problems and that was pretty special, I got one of the vegan pies (can remember the name) and the toppings density was perfect (my beef with vegan pizzas - haha - is that they usually seem insubstantial without the cheese). Bravi Ragazzi, indeed!', u\"I really love Neapolitan pizza This is probably the best pizza place  down Brooklyn! Congrats guys\\nCan't wait to order again...\", u\"The pizza here is really a let down. They don't let the dough cook long enough or the fire isn't hot enough, tastes doughy and uncooked. The pie was soggy by the time I got it to my house, the soppressata was wet and had a weird taste to it. The entire pie was cut into quarters, slices were too big to eat so I had to re cut when I got home. Overall just a really bad experience. They do not do pizza right at this place, better to go over to saraghina.\", u\"This is really excellent pizza. I highly recommend it. I've had a few pizzas so far and they have all been excellent. A great addition to the neighborhood.\", u\"Really wanted to love this place, willing to give it another shot though. I like a doughy pizza but it shouldn't be soggy. This pizza was just wet and soggy. The pizza that's divided into three different pizzas is beyond odd. They should cut it/spectate the different styles differently--I'd recommend similar to a peace sign. How they currently do it give you almost a mixed toppings between the different pizzas as opposed to 2 slices of each style. The place itself was super HOT, they really need to figure the AC out, far too hot with the pizza oven going. Hoping they will finish off the restaurant too so the pipes to the oven aren't as jankily exposed. Will try again but maybe in a few months.\", u'Thank you, thank you, thank you for coming to Bed-Stuy Brooklyn! Best pizza I have had in the neighborhood. Service (we ordered the Margherita pies for pick up) was super polite and fast. The tomato sauce was not too sweet. Nice touch of fresh basil. Dough was SUPURB! BRAVI!!!!', u\"I'm pretty disappointed. I was hoping that the reviews were accurate but I can't say that I had a great experience. The food was incredibly fast which was really helpful and the main reason I selected this restaurant on UberEATS. The bruschetta that I got was just burned bread. The burn on them overwhelmed the delicious tomatoes and made it inedible. The pizza flavor was good but the dough was soggy/burned in some places and undercooked in others and could not be lifted, requiring a fork and knife.\", u'so happy this pizza place opened up. ordered the margherita pizza for pick up. It was delicious and they made it really quickly. wish they had larger pies though. I think the only size they have is an 11 inch. will definitely go here again.'], u'80.Father Knows Best': [u\"This was my first time here, and the restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing. There is a lot of natural light in the place, and there is seating in the backyard. Our waitress was extremely friendly, and I immediately felt welcomed.\\n\\nThe food was amazing! I had the Benedict, and the biscuit was homemade and fluffy. It was the best Benedict I've had in a while! I have no complaints, and I will definitely be coming again!\\n\\nI would recommend you do too!\", u'Judging by the reviews given by other consumers, I guess I can chalk my experience up to a bad night.  It seemed to work as a bar better than a restaurant.  There was loud live music, and not much of a food selection so we ended up getting a few appetizers.   \\n\\nFrom every appetizer we ate their seemed to be dark colored hair in it, the girl I was with thought that it was her some how (this happened twice to me and once to her.)  in till we got our wings which was served way later then the rest of our food.  Where we got our final hair and it was blonde.  \\n\\nThe live music was so loud there was no point in trying to bring some one over and complain so when receiving the bill I was prompted to leave the tip amount as :purchase hair nets.', u\"I live down the block from this place, and I've visited this place many times - morning, day, and evening. It seems if you're not friends with the people working there, you will receive lesser service. How you look also seems important as to how friendly staff is with you. I'll wait for servers/bartenders to finish 10-minute long conversations before I even get looked at. They will also attend to friends and familiar faces first, no matter how long you've been standing there with a card/cash in hand. \\n\\nThis past Sunday, my boyfriend and I wanted to get brunch, as we have the past few weeks because the CHEFS are friendly and food is delicious. When we walked in, the woman at the counter told us it was a full house, as we could see that all tables were taken. Reasonable, right? But she didn't offer us a wait time, or a coffee (as this is half cafe), a drink, nothing. She just turned us away. She had served us the last couple of weekends we went, so she knew we were frequenters, but didn't care to give us more attention than to let us know there is no room for us and walked off to serve a table. It was strange and embarrassing. Usually I'm up for restaurants that make neighborhoods cleaner and thrive, but when people are turned away like that, (maybe we didn't look cool enough to be respected as frequent neighborhood customers), it's an ugly quality for a restaurant to have. The gross part of gentrification. God forbid someone that's been living in the neighborhood longer than the angry little blonde manager has lived, walks in there and asks for a coffee. They even have a customer of the month wall - which would be great, if their service wasn't totally based on how much each staff member personally likes you. You're there to impress THEM, it seems, not the other way around. \\n\\nFroilan and Routine are also bar restaurants half a block down towards the L on Wilson Ave. Their service, smiles, and care for customers (especially frequent customers) no matter what they look like or how busy they are, is 1000% better. I recommend them!\\n\\nSorry guys, you had my business, even without me being a favorite. But this Sunday incident made me want to never walk in there again and I will never endorse this restaurant to anyone I know. These two stars are for strictly for the chefs and their food. I hope they find a home that will praise their food as much as it should be. \\n\\n~you suck~\", u\"I would do anything for their mac&cheese with bacon and jal. HUGE for 10$ only! I'm a big fan of moktails and they have Rose Water and it's just simply amazing. Vegan and vegetarian options are available. Thank you for opening amazing spot right next to my home\", u\"Really cool chill bar. I live close by and have been here a few times. I have had some of the food and cocktails and all were really good. It is a great atmosphere to hangout and have some great food and drinks. The only downside is that if you're not a smoker you won't really be able to enjoy the outdoor seating as the smell is really strong. Overall, great place.\", u'Super rad bar. Fast wifi, great back deck, patrons, and staff. Fair prices, definitely go... cuz father knows best. And not in a Freudian way', u\"Soooooo good. I loved the nachos and the iced latte was AMAZING. Sad I don't live in this area anymore. Best brunch.\", u\"Walked in just as they opened, Steph was wonderful and provided helpful suggestions on good dishes. The Benedict was cooked perfect and was prefect portion. The egg sandwich was even bigger and delicious, only change I would make would next time I'd ask for less cheese on the sandwich. Final note the coffee was delicious\", u\"Absolutely great place and good food with nice music. \\n\\nBest of all it's walking distance from home.\\n\\nI would definitely return.\\n\\n\\u96f0\\u56f2\\u6c17\\u304c\\u51c4\\u304f\\u3044\\u3044\\u30ec\\u30b9\\u30c8\\u30e9\\u30f3\\u30d0\\u30fc\\u3067\\u3059\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4eca\\u306f\\u5bd2\\u3044\\u304b\\u3089outside\\u306b\\u306f\\u884c\\u304b\\u306a\\u3044\\u3051\\u3069\\u3001\\u6696\\u304b\\u3044\\u6642\\u306f\\u6700\\u9ad8\\u306e\\u30c6\\u30e9\\u30b9\\u304c\\u3042\\u308a\\u307e\\u3059\\u3002\\n\\n\\u30e1\\u30cb\\u30e5\\u30fc\\u306f\\u3088\\u304f\\u3042\\u308b\\u30a2\\u30e1\\u30ea\\u30ab\\u30f3\\u3060\\u3051\\u3069\\u3001\\u306a\\u304b\\u306a\\u304b\\u7f8e\\u5473\\u3057\\u3044\\u3067\\u3059\\u3002\\n\\u30c9\\u30ea\\u30f3\\u30af\\u3082\\u3001\\u304b\\u306a\\u308a\\u826f\\u5fc3\\u7684\\u4fa1\\u683c\\u3067\\u5f92\\u6b69\\u570f\\u5185\\u306e\\u4f7f\\u3048\\u308b\\u304a\\u5e97\\u3063\\u3066\\u611f\\u3058\\u3067\\u3059\\u3002\\n\\u307e\\u305f\\u3001\\u97f3\\u697d\\u306e\\u30bb\\u30ec\\u30af\\u30c8\\u3082\\u5fc3\\u5730\\u3088\\u304f\\u3066\\u3001\\u3053\\u308c\\u306f\\u30ea\\u30d4\\u30fc\\u30c8\\u3057\\u3061\\u3083\\u3046\\u304a\\u5e97\\u3067\\u3059\\u3002\", u\"Had a good time until the fcking Greg took the olives away from me because of a $2.- tip \\nHello Greg I tip base on the service and you my sir sucked !!!!!\\nI'll be back with a $20- tip for better service !!!!!!!\", u\"I really wanted to love this place. Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning. Upon walking in, there's a pretty cool vibe overall and I love that they have indoor and outdoor seating. \\n\\nService:\\nOnce seated, we were approached relatively quickly to see if we were ready to order. Since we did need a bit of extra time, it took them another 10 minutes to come around to us again. At the time our order was placed, I saw a party just being seated at a nearby table. We were still waiting for our food, while the table that had just been seated had all received theirs already. We had ordered a plate of nachos, and an order of the lumberdad. After a few minutes longer, we did receive the order of nachos so I didn't think much of it. After another 15-20 minutes of us lightly munching on the nachos bc we were still waiting for the other plate, my friend actually went up to ask about the dish bc they never came back to check on us. He brought his own coffee cup up to the bar to be refilled! They then said they were going to check on my plate. After about 5 minutes, they brought out my dish that they clearly forgot but to add insult to injury they apparently tried to make it in the 5 minutes and it was burnt to the point that it was inedible! I understand that things happen, and typically I wouldn't make as big of a deal but the lack of care and consideration just makes a customer to an establishment feel pretty shitty. I gave them one additional star only bc we did try the nachos and they were relatively good, so I feel like this place does have a lot of potential. Sadly it just wasn't a good experience for me. I will not be retuning.\", u'I came here last night with a friend around 10p and I loved it as soon as I sat down.  The place is so cute and has an outdoor seating area. We sat inside and ordered watermelon margaritas which were so good.  We also ordered the chorizo nachos which were delicious.  I will definitely be coming back here :)', u'Great bar in the neighborhood! You can eat there and drink there and the price is very good. Nice vibes in the bar. Love the outdoor area!', u'Great bar, awesome brunch! They have reasonably priced beer and well drinks. They also have some amazing cocktails!  Nice atmosphere with a big patio out back. Food is delicious! We always get the same thing Cheddar Scallion Biscuit (Chipotle Honey butter is the Bomb!) Macho Manachos, mmmmm. I wanna try something else but the nachos are so damb good!', u\"My friend forced me to go here-- It was a spontaneous afternoon snack that we had to try. She was always telling me how good the food is-- i'm so happy we went. \\n\\nThe restaurant wasn't to busy so it was seat yourself and order by the bar. It was a mid Sunday-- So it was right after Lunch and right before dinner time frame. \\n\\nWe had the pumpkin hummus!! Amazing-- the texture was perfect-- not to liquid not to heavy. It was really the perfect amount of everything. This was my first time that I tried pumpkin anything and I must say I am hooked!! We also had the load nachos-- YUMMY!!! \\n\\nCan't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. \\n\\nI also heard that they have a movie night event and each day they offer different activities-- which is great because you get to socialize with other people that you normally wouldn't. \\n\\nStop by if not for the Social Aspect then for the PUMPKIN Hummus!!!\", u'I wish retaurants would adopt the \"frequent flyer miles\" concept for the amount of times that my husband and I have ordered from this popular eatery. We would have cashed in those rewards by now.\\n\\nWe have had the following: \\n\\nMacho Manachos Brunch (tortilla chips, braised chicken, salsa, black beans, queso, avocado sauce, and 2 sunny eggs) $12;\\n\\nDANK Pancakes Brunch\\xa0(vegan banana bread pancakes, coconut rum sauce, strawberries) $11; and \\n\\nPapi\\'s Huevos Brunch (baked eggs in spicy tomato sauce with chickpeas, kale and 7 grain toast) $11.\\n\\nAll of these dishes are packed with flavor and a generous portion that will keep you fueled and ready to start your day. \\n\\nI am usually on the go, so i have never had the opportunity to enjoy the ambiance. I hope to stop by in the evening for the live entertainment sometime soon.', u\"Fathers Knows Best has so many really great qualities. It's open all day long, offering a place to go besides Routine to get some work done and you can stay into the evening for their dinner dishes and some drinks. Bartenders are normally friendly. The menu pleases meat eaters and vegetarians alike. Go on one of their specialty night and get entertained by a small-time comedian or local musician. Don't want to be inside? Sit in their front or back patios. For this part of Bushwick, a place like Fathers is a welcome addition. I have a few friends that have no problem going alone and sitting at the bar because they'll quickly make a new friend.\", u\"Great drinks. Great food. Good service. \\n\\nOrder the loco coco drink. It's rum in a coconut with the coconut water. So good!\\n\\nI think they only had one or two servers/bartenders so we didn't get a lot of attention and weren't really checked on much but we were never kept waiting in ordering or for our food/drinks. \\n\\nP.s. One check per table but they can take multiple payments on a single check.\", u'Moved to the area recently and have been to this place several times; staff has always been friendly and helpful and the drinks are reasonably priced. I also tried the egg sandwich which was quite good! I highly recommend this caf\\xe9 and really deserves five stars', u'Service was quick and friendly, grilled cheese mushroom and reuben sandwich was just the thing for a late night dinner.  Mix of newer beats and old-time soul on the speakers.  Simply a great bar with enough great comfort food for the non-drinking patron (us).'], u'180.Ceci\\u2019s Latin Cuisine': [u'Hands down the best....only place you need to be eating spanish food!!\\n\\nChicken is good!\\n\\nLasagna will put you in a coma!\\n\\nEverything in there will make you shed tears of joy...', u\"This is probably one of the best Spanish food in the area. Portions are very generous and prices are very reasonable. Haven't been disappointed yet and I work in the area and eat here often!\", u\"Yelper here that doesn't cook! That would be me. Ceci's is one of my weekday go to restaurants for awesome Spanish eats. I love it one because it's suuuuper cheap. I don't think they know they should charge more for their great pseudo- home cooked food. *shhh* \\n\\nAll of the food here taste good and it's not heavily spicy or salty. They have something for whatever works for you, fish, stewed chicken, oxtails. Top it off with rice, sweet plantains, salad and beans. Ahhhh it's perfect. I wish they were on seamless or had delivery to my nabe but it's fine to make it to them. I call ahead, pick it up and leave a tip for the endearing customer service.\", u'Love this place!\\nThis is our go-to spot at work for lunch , and when on the way home for dinner.\\nThe service is great and the Latin food is on point', u\"A housemate got Ceci's delivered while I was on a conference call and I could barely focus after. The scent of fried chicken made me want to tear my headphones off and immediately ask where she got it from. And much to my pleasure she handed me one of Ceci's ads.\\n\\nBig plus that they're located close to home. Even bigger plus is the fact that they deliver, which means... my first New York delivery experience!!\\n\\nWe couldn't find them on GrubHub or Seamless so you gotta call in and order. We ordered a family special -- fried chicken chunks (bone-in), yellow rice, beans, salad, and a 2-liter soda. After we paid the delivery man, we went for it. The chicken was hot and juicy, and when you pair it with the rice and beans it makes for a hearty meal. A meal with a flavor we hadn't really tried yet. Until this point.\\n\\nGive them a call and try for yourself! And while we're in this part of Brooklyn, this'll be our go-to place for a cheap and delicious meal!\", u\"This place is amazing. The restaurant is new amd its an added benefit to the area. I ordered fried Chicken and French fries. The chicken was so incredibly fresh and made to order so there was a wait but who cares. I'm happy that this establishment is in the neighborhood.\", u'Amazing roast chicken, beans and rice. Got a fast delivery at lunchtime. First time trying this place and it was a hit!', u'They screwed up my order and made what they wanted to make. When I told them my order was wrong the woman said I never said that when I repeated myself more than 3 times. The woman does not understand English very well so you have to continue to repeat your order. The first time I ordered they had to transfer me to someone else because the woman that answered the phone didn\\'t understand English. This is the 3rd time I\\'ve ordered from them and the last. The woman was nasty and when I told her my order was wrong and she said she wasn\\'t fixing it. So I told her I wasn\\'t buying it if she didn\\'t correct my order. She said \"So.\" So she lost out on $17 from me plus the food that was ordered by my sister. Bad customer service and they are fairly new to the area.', u'The food is amazing the customer service is great as well however the bake chicken is a lil too salty otherwise then that everything is a good pick.'], u'100.The Douglass Public House': [u\"Dope bar and grill, owner is amazing. Bartenders know their stuff and the drinks are pretty reasonably priced especially for the area.\\n\\nDefinitely plan on coming back any time I'm in the area.\", u\"We were pretty disappointed with our experience at the Douglass.  Stopped in for dinner and a couple of drinks on a Monday.  Seemed like there was only one staff member working, handling bar, serving tables, cleaning, etc.  Felt bad for him, but the wait time for everything was interminable, even though it wasn't terribly crowded.\\n\\nThey were out of the Three's pilsner I ordered, and the draft list was fairly nondescript.  My wife ordered the Founders IPA I, which was flat and off--tasted very much like they badly need to have their taps cleaned.  Before we ordered, we noticed our table was badly wobbly--asked for a coaster to balance, which I eventually gave up and tracked down and fixed myself after the drinks arrived.  The food was a mixed bag--the fried pickles were great, with an interesting chipotle aioli dipping sauce.  I tried the shaved brussels sprout salad, which was palatable.  My wife's veggie burger was dry and pretty far from palatable.  We bagged the plans to stay for a few drinks and moved on to Three's Brewing for better beer and better times.\", u\"We had high hopes for this pub thanks to the reviews, but the minute that we walked into this place, I realized that we had made a horrible mistake. We stopped by just after 9 p.m. on Trivia Tuesday, which meant that we had to listen to an obnoxiously loud host woo a small crowd of ten with his cheesy questions. Sadly, the misery didn't end there.\\n\\nOur waitress was very adept at delivering water and menus, but that was about the extent of her customer service skills. When we inquired about the beer on tap, she was unable to name any beer other than Guinness, and recommended that we saddle up to the bar to order our drinks. \\n\\nWith our nothing to write home about beer in tow, we returned to our table, and about 20 minutes later, we finally got her to stop chatting up the other staff long enough to place our order. The Mac n Cheese balls were dry, tasteless, and overcooked, my friend's burger tasted like stale popcorn grease, and my BLT was mediocre at best. Not once did she stop by to check on us: we had to flag her down five times in order to 1) refill our drinks, 2) remind her that we had asked her to refill our drinks, 3) ask for our check, 4) ask for our check again, and 5) remind her that we had asked for our check.\\n\\nThe icing on this overcooked, bland, and poorly served cake was when a man who down on his luck badgered my husband until he coughed up some money. \\n\\nIn short, I would avoid The Douglass at all costs.\", u\"It's cozy, cute, and has a great selection of cocktails.\\nCame here randomly on a Sunday afternoon after brunch and shopping, and was really pleased.\\nWould absolutely return and try more items on the menu.\\nMy girlfriend and I sat at the corner of the bar and sipped on some cocktails while catching up. Was such a positive experience. Go Brooklyn!\", u'I liked this place when it was Sheep Station (which was a much cooler name).\\n\\nThankfully, they still have their multitude of TVs for sports and a great beer selection.\\n\\nBartender was a cool dude.', u'Gotta love a new business. Location is just right to succeed. Space is small-ish but not overcrowded. Background music isn\\'t too loud.... both add to the appeal\\nGood number of beer taps but menu is inaccurate. Tried just small bite menu. Sliders have a nice grill Char and are cooked properly. Wings are tasty but not really buffalo style, and are \"chopped\" strangely ( see photo ). Chicken tacos are a good small bite. Rings are basic with an interesting horseradish sauce. \\nWill give it a second date.', u\"Great spot for pub food and good beer/cocktails.  Have been coming to the Douglas for a while now - it doesn't disappoint.  Good music and good chill vibe.  It's not a sports bar, but they will have the games on (which is great).   My wife (who is not into sports) loves it as well, so it's great that we come enjoy a nice cocktail and burger and I can peek up at score when she's not looking ;).\\n\\nThey have a back room with a private bathroom which you can rent out.  I've got booked it for a fantasy football draft party.  The owner I worked with was super nice and accommodating.\", u\"Business travel and found this place near my hotel. Welcoming bartender immediately gave me the skinny on some good draft IPAs. Ordered a burger, medium-rare, and the beef was fantastic. Local ordered and fresh. Didn't need any seasonings. Met the owner, Peter, and his brother which led to an evening of great conversation, stories and learning the history of the area.\", u'Great local bar to grab beers and a burger.  Laid back atmosphere, has tables for sit down dining as well. \\n\\nWould recommend and will be back again!', u\"I had a great time at The Douglass! Stephen was a super friendly bartender and the server, whose name I think was Nikki, attended to our every need and was so nice. After an appetizer of Mac and cheese balls and the burgers that my friends and I had we were all stuffed but the Mac and cheese balls were so good we couldn't deny ourselves a second round of them to go along with our after dinner beers. I would highly recommend this place to anybody living in or visiting the neighborhood!\", u'Great atmosphere. Food and drinks are very tasty and at a reasonable price. It is best to come here with friends.', u\"A very solid neighborhood pub and grill. Front room is more pub friendly and the back room is more family friendly. Good burgers, chips, sandwiches, appetizers - everything you'd want in such a place. Lovely staff.  No outdoor seating.\", u\"It's a cozy lil pub. The waitress was friendly and attentive . My husband and I were eating silently . We both agreed it was the best burger we ever had !!!!\", u\"Watch Rugby and any other big sports event here, and also eat a nice brunch with the fam or with friends or solo, it's rad. Don't forget the fabulous draft selection either! Great staff and owners.\", u\"We hosted a private event here (our after-wedding brunch) and it turned out fabulous. The managers were so easy to work with, which is huge when you're planning a wedding, and they helped us find a great menu that would fit our budget. The brunch food was all great and they were so nice and accommodating. They even let us over-stay our welcome, hanging out in the back room. It was a beautiful sunny day and they had all their windows open and it was just a lovely, sunny atmosphere. Great drinks, great staff, great burgers, and even better french fries!. Would recommend for dinner, brunch, or a private event!\", u'Rather lackluster visit.\\n\\nBeer was flat - Douglass Wheat beer was completely flat (we had to send two beers back and noticed only a day or two later when rechecking the receipt that we were charged those two beers - waitress sipped our beers and agreed it was \"definitely flat\"), tried three others, and all tasted close to flat (barely bubbly).\\n\\nMini dougies (sliders) looked and sounded really good.. cooked to the correct temperature but the patty itself was underseasoned and rather bland.', u\"If I gave stars for friendly service, I'd give this place a 6, but alas.  \\n\\nI stopped in for a drink on the way home, and, because I just can't shake my negroni kick, I jumped at the negroni from the classics menu.  The ingredients listed included gin, campari, and . . . lillet?!  Let's just say I was willing to give it a try because the ratings on this place were so good and because maybe it was someone's way of telling me to branch out.  TERRIBLE IDEA.  Tasted like cough syrup, emphasis on the syrup--I know, I know: non-negroni drinkers think that's how they taste all the time, but this was really bad.  The bartender, also a negroni afficionado, showed sympathy and told me I wasn't the only one who'd shared that opinion.  She was nice enough to make me a truly classic negroni on the house for my next drink.\\n\\nBy that time, I had started to feel snacky, so I ordered fries.  An entire half of the soccer game went by before I received them.  They tasted very good, but there was something sort of not-quite-stale/not-quite-fresh about the texture . . . probably had something to do with the fact that they sat out on the kitchen ledge for the last the last 7-10 minutes of the 45-minute wait instead of coming to me fresh.\\n\\nI'll probably give this place a pass because I live so close and because the service was friendly, so maybe I'll chock up the so-so-ness of my experience to a new place still working out the kinks.\\n\\n(Just make sure you specify no Lillet with your negroni.)\", u\"The Douglass is a great bar in the Boerum Hill / Park Slope area of Brooklyn, which I've been to quite a few times, in very different circumstances. Once or twice to watch Six Nations rugby games, once on a Saturday night for some drinks with friends and a couple of times in the early evening for casual drinks and food with friends. Each visit, no matter the reason, has been great! The bar staff are friendly and attentive, and the food is excellent (I like the wings + mac & cheese balls especially). I'm not much of a beer aficionado so can't speak to that, but friends I've visited with have liked the selection. If you're in the area, or even if you're not, be sure to visit The Douglass.\", u\"Spacious, airy, strong cocktails and great service without an heir of pretension.  Yes, friendly service from authentic individuals.  A complete rarity!  What more do you want from a Brooklyn bar. Ok, how about a lovely rustic decor?  They got that too.  Unobtrusive TV placement.  Check.  We'll be back!\", u'Nice place in the park slope area. burgers are great, nice and mouth watering. service was good. Drinks were okay, but not what I expected. \\nNice place will give them another shot.'], u'102.Roll-N-Roaster': [u\"Watched a movie at the theater down the street and then came here for a late dinner around 11 pm. I just moved to NY a few months ago. I came here with a friend who has lived in BK his whole life. I was happy to try it because you know a restaurant is good when it's been around for 50 years. \\n\\nThis is sort of like a fancier, family owned-ish version of Wendy's. The 70's feel reminded me of Wendy's. The whole point is that you can add cheese to anything on the menu. Burgers, chicken tenders, fries, roast beef sandwiches, you name it. I would have loved cheese fries but I'm lactose intolerant so that wouldn't have ended well. \\n\\nI got a plate of chicken tenders and my friend got the roast beef sandwich, mozzarella sticks, and fries. He actually put the mozzarella sticks inside of his sandwich, apparently a trick he's been doing since he was 16 at Roll n Roaster. The chicken tenders were really good. I added a side of sweet and sour which was okay. I actually ended up switching it for ketchup to stay basic. The tenders were perfectly crispy, piping hot, and had the perfect chicken to breaking ratio. The roast beef sandwich is a go-to for the locals, and there was no trace of it being eaten after we were done at the table. The fries were pretty good, as many posted photos, they're round and very potato-ey, just the way fries should be. \\n\\nThis is a cheap place to come with kids or as a teenager. The place was filled with teenagers on the Friday night that I was there around 11 p.m. I think this is the cool hangout spot for teens in Sheepshead. It made us both feel so old. \\n\\nI'll be back soon because I want to try the milkshakes which are highly coveted. I'll have to take a few dairy pills but you do what you have to do for a Yelp review.\", u\"Went here 5 weeks ago for lunch. Was turned off when the manager and another cashier argued with a customer. The customer wanted a new burger since his was uncooked and the manager and cashier got into a shouting match with him, refusing to give him a cooked burger. This was in front of at least 10 other paying customers. This was -really- tacky. Eventually they made him a new burger, but not after causing an awkward and embarrassing moment in the restaurant for everyone there.\\n\\nCame here for take-out earlier this week to try it again. I ordered gravy + mashed potatoes for my friend and was charged 65 cents extra for the gravy to be placed in a small plastic cup instead of directly on the gravy. No big deal. Then I pay an extra few dollars for two orders of cheese fries instead of getting regular fries. I get home - no cheese on the fries. This was really annoying, and I didn't feel like going back for 2 small cups of cheese (and potentially getting screamed at by the manager). Won't go back here again.\", u\"I'm a lucky, lucky girl to have experienced Roll N Roaster. \\n\\nI came on a Saturday night and had the classic roast beef sandwich with cheez and onion, their cheeseburger, corn fritters and the cheez fries. Generally, not being a huge fan of roast beef, I was a bit doubtful of how great everyone said the sandwich here is. Butttt, once I took a bite of my first roast beef sandwich, I now get it. The cheez makes everything taste twice as good, and the cheez fries was perfect. It wasn't mushy but crunchy and fried and perfect cute circles instead of the normal fries shape. The corn fritters were sweet and each bite I took had pieces of corn in it.\\n\\nIt was pretty busy on a weekend night, but we managed to find parking on the street (their parking lot was packed). \\n\\nDefinitely cannot wait to come back here again!\", u'You wont meet anyone from Brooklyn (a true Brooklynite) who says they haven\\'t tried a roast beef from Roll N Roaster.\\n\\nAlso you must have heard the jingle or seen the commercial at least once in your life. If not, get on it. \\n\\nOn to the sandwiches, classic roast beef sandwiches with cheez and onions. I also recommend the cheez fries. Their motto is you can have cheez on anything you pleez and I recommend you live by that motto. If you ever visit the \"Bay Area\" in brooklyn, you have to try Roll N Roaster. It\\'s quintessential Brooklyn food served the same way for over 40 years.', u\"We enjoyed grabbing a lot of things. Seems like that's the strategy for people coming here for the first (or 81st) time. \\nIn summary, the good was: roast beef, rehydrated mashed potatoes with gravy, fried clam strips, soft drinks, including bottled water that is not a ripoff \\nThe not-so-good was: blah cheez (sauce) burger and the french fry discs. \\nAll in all, we did okay and enjoyed watching three spins of the birthday wheel. Local flavor definitely on display.\", u'The roast beef is a must try. Certain times can get very busy, particularly around lunch time. Service is good, they do try to serve you as fast as possible. \\n\\n-Alcoholic bev options.\\n-Parking lot, can get crowded however there is a designated area for just pickup. Easy pull-up and pick up. \\n-very large seating area. \\n-moderate prices. \\n\\nVery nice area, located pretty close to manhattan beach.', u'Love this place since childhood.  Try to go back every chance I get.  Bring family members here.  Nothing beats the roast beef sandwiches with extra gravy.  Love the cottage fries and freshly made lemonade.', u\"I'm not sure why I love this place, but I really do! I've been coming here since I was a kid whenever we visit family in Brooklyn. It's a weird (but awesome) mix of fast food, roller skater drive-in, and diner feel. \\n\\nWhile everyone's favorite is the roast beef sandwich, mine is actually the chicken fingers and fries with a side of cheese sauce. Warning: this will not be a healthy meal! \\n\\nThe fries and chicken fingers are delicious! Onion rings, clam strips, and many other menu items are also super yummy. \\n\\nDefinitely a great spot for kids or anyone looking for a quick bite!\", u\"As a kid growing up in Brooklyn, Coney Island used to advertise POP (Pay one Price) $5.95 to ride all of the rides. Afterwards, we'd grab hot dogs at Nathan's, pizza or Roll-N-Roaster. \\n\\nThis is a true Brooklyn staple (My Brooklyn-French Wife is screaming Brennan & Carr), I'm a Roll-Roaster kid. This food isn't fancy. There are no short rib, aged burger blends. What you're getting is an honest to goodness, freshly cut, hot roast beef sandwich. You can add cheese whiz or Italian cheese but for this Italian kid? It was the best thing in my world growing up.\\n\\nI had to take my son here for lunch. Both him and his brother were born in Smithtown Hospital. I tried my best to hit up the old spots but somehow Roll-N-Roaster slipped thru the cracks.\\n\\nWe walk into the same spot my grandparents did ordering lunch. The menu board font is still the same, thankfully no one updated the place. That's a good thing, You can get a little nutso in here but we decided to keep it old stool, (2) Roll-N-Roaster Roast Beef sammys on a kaiser roll and fries. I ordered sweet potato and he ordered potato french fries. \\n\\nThe sandwiches come to us, man what a treat. Freshly cut roast beef on a roll. \\nHeaven.\\n\\nThe french fries are shaped round like pickles, its always funny to see. How do they get the same yield cutting it that way I will never know.\\n\\nI'm watching families come in with their kids, construction guys, take out orders being picked up, Roll-N-Roaster has been a neighborhood staple for generations. I'm glad to see its still in operation after all these years.\", u'This was my first time and roll-n-roaster and I must say it was pretty good, I had the hamburger with cheez, and fries and cheez, my girlfriend who is a vegetarian ordered the fish filet and fries as well as a milk shake, I had a sip of her milkshake and it was pretty friggin tatsty!', u'I admittedly was rolling my eyes when my parents suggested we go here. I was pleasantly surprised. 7 of us left ridiculously full for less than $100. The roast beef sandwiches were yummy. The kids loved everything they tried, including the corn fritters.', u\"Whenever I'm in the area watching a movie at UA, and I'm feeling a little hungry and I want a quick bite around the area, this is the place to go!\\n\\nIt can get quite busy during certain times of the day, however it's similar to a fast food chain, where they take your order and your food comes in a fast paced manner. There are plenty of seating, so don't worry about not finding a seat. Good thing about this place is that it closes late and people seem to come here and just chill, like a hangout spot. \\n\\nI personally really enjoy their roast beef sandwich! Definitely have to add that gravy sauce, the onion and the cheese to make it one of the most delicious sandwiches you can ever have. If you don't eat beef, there are other meat options for you to choose from, but they are known for their roast beef sandwiches! There corn fritters and cheese fries are quite delicious as well! You have to get their orangeade! So so good!\\n\\nDefinitely a go to spot and worth coming here if you still haven't tried it yet!\", u\"Free pizza yahoo! only for total purchases over $35 but the pizza is so flat and not that great tasting so you don't really need it. The roast beef, the cheese on anything for a little extra change, the corn fritters, the clam strips, I can go on but just look at that menu and get your butts over here because everything (except that pizza) is so good. If it's your birthday you get to spin the wheel and win a prize. I think it's for free food. Kids under a certain age get a free balloon! Otherwise pay $2. Make sure you show your kid to get the free balloon. \\n\\nThere's a parking lot and ample street parking. You come in, order your food from the cashiers and they give you a # on your receipt. They call your # from the loud speaker to pick up the food. Plenty of seats! Great for large groups. Once you leave your table, workers come over right away to clean it for the next guests. \\n\\nIf you ride your bicycle here and show them your helmet you get a free bottle of water. \\n\\nThey also have pick up on the side when you call your order ahead of time. \\n\\nWhen in Coney Island/Bensonhurst area stop by this joint. It's worth it!\", u\"Am not really sure what it says about me, but the Roll-N-Roaster is one of my favorite places to eat in all of Brooklyn.  Whenever I'm even remotely in the vicinity, which sadly isn't too often, I will scheme and finagle in the hopes of winding up here.  Why do I LOVE it so?\\n\\nWell first and foremost, that Roast Beef.  Duh.  To fully appreciate its meaty, tender splendor, be sure to ask for it dipped and topped with griddled onions.  I prefer to skip the option of adding cheez 'cause I think it detracts from the beef, rather than complements it.  But that's me.  \\n\\nThe Corn Fritters that so many Yelpers seem to go on about have grown on me too.  At first, they seemed a bit sweet, but now I can't imagine not ordering them.  And if you're a fan of Onion Rings with an ultra-crispy breading, then I'd recommend those too.  \\n\\nLOVE that I can get a tiny bottle of Chardonnay for under $4, if I'm so inclined (and I'm often inclined). LOVE that it's made by Barefoot, a surprisingly drinkable and award-winning el cheapo vintner.  I've been known to chug it from the bottle like beer.  Don't judge.\\n\\nLOVE that you can get a free 12 inch pizza if you spend over $35.  Sure, it's sub par, but totally edible in a pinch.  \\n\\nI'll always choose this place over nearby-ish rival, Brennan & Carr.  Always.  Not too long ago, hubby convinced me to eat there again after a very meh first experience years before:  Alas, the Roast Beef was utterly bland, while the bun was sooo soggy after being dipped in gravy, that it literally disintegrated.  Plus, the entire restaurant had an appetite-killing musty odor that I still can't get out of my head.  Never again.\\n\\nThe Roll-N-Roaster is a microcosm of pre-ironic, pre-flannel shirt and high-waisted skinny jeans-wearing Brooklyn.  And because of that, it feels oddly comforting to me, summoning up memories of stopping in with the kid after spending the day at the Rockaways.  LOVE that the kid would always leave with a free balloon.\\n\\nAm willing to concede that to truly grasp the charm of this spot, you may have to be a longtime Brooklynite, harboring a bit of wistfulness for a time before your beloved borough became a national arbiter of cool.  But still...  That Roast Beef.\", u\"After my foodie coworker was surprised that I've never been to roll n roaster I bookmarked it and made a note to go next time I'm in the area. I left a boat ride and was pretty hungry and my friends were really upset that I was insisting that we eat here. Now I understand why. \\nI really wanted to love this place but it's literally an overpriced McDonald's. Actually I think McDonalds is better. I ordered the popular roast beef sandwich double dipped With onions and cheese, corn fritters and orangeade. I believe it was around $15 and I was barely full afterwards. The sandwich was very mediocre and you don't get much meat on it. There wasn't much taste to it. The corn fritters were okay and had a greasy aftertaste. \\nIt's overrated, overpriced, and I wouldn't return.\", u\"I Grew up coming here and the place remains AWESOME!!!\\n\\nMy go tos are the Orangeade (orange juice and soda with half an orange in the cup), mashed potatoes with gravy (lots of brown gravy) and, of course, a medium roast beef with grilled onions (optional), double dipped in gravy. \\n\\nThe roast beef sandwich is a classic. You MUST order it if you come here. The beef is warm and tender and cooked just right. The bun is soft and just the right size and texture. The gravy totally seals the deal.\\n\\nThe place has a free parking lot to accommodate cars (it's a bit of a walk, about a mile, from the nearest subway at Sheepshead Bay on the B/Q lines).\\n\\nThere are often lines to order but the counter people work fast and move everyone along efficiently. \\n\\nThe seating is old school benches and tables like at a fast food joint. You can hear the counter people announcing, over a microphone, the next order that's up. It's certainly not a pretty or romantic place. That's not why you come here. You come here because it's delicious!!!!\\n\\nThey recently added items to their menu like pizza. It's fine. I wouldn't waste my time with the distraction though. Come here for what they are known for and you won't regret it!\", u'I should have ordered the highly recommended roast beef sandwich, but I was never a fan of roast beef so I went with a grilled chicken sandwich.\\n\\nI asked the cashier if that was a good option and she said yes, but I was surprised to see it just literally a piece of grilled chicken in-between 2 buns.  I was expecting something else-- like maybe lettuce/tomatoes?  Is that too much of an expectation for $4 something?  The chicken was dry and burnt with charcoal, which I would have complained about but seeing that sign \"check your order before your leave\" (or something of that sort), it sounded too customer-unfriendly.\\n\\nI also ordered fries and opted out of the cheese (sounds like the fries & cheese is what everyone was raving about), but I was still disappointed.  The fries came out sort of hard/ not potatoey which I wasn\\'t a total fan of.\\n\\nOn the plus side, there is parking and they make their buns daily!\\n\\nThis would be a good option to eat at due to their convenient hours, but I did not think the rating was consistent with my experience or I should have ordered something else.', u'Came back for dinner with the kids. Harder to find parking and crowded at the restaurant at 8pm. Mess up our order and waited 30 mins for the food. Order the burger this time.  Nothing special at all.   Just burger and the bun.  Kids love the pizza.', u'Always awesome. The roast beef is the bomb. They will put cheez on anything on their menu for an up charge (I forget how much). Anything. I was there once and a friend ordered a beer and told them to put cheez on it. They did. Poured it all over the bottle. Lol.', u\"Part of knowing where to eat is what to order. When a complementary pizza is given for orders over X amount  of dollars, don't expect some gourmet brick oven pizza. As a vegetarian, I am bias- but why the hell would you ever order that nasty looking roast beef(?)\\n\\nI love their lemonade, limeade, and their cheese fries are God. My sister goes gaga over their cheeseburgers, iced tea, milkshakes, and cheez!\\n\\nMake sure to ask for an extra bag to grab some onions, those things are like crack\"], u'115.The Westbury Inn': [u\"Found myself in this local joint after searching Yelp for a down-to-earth, non-gentrified bar. I'm still in the process of finding some non-pretentious watering holes in my new hood, having moved from Astoria to BK. This place did not disappoint! Arrived half an hour after they opened on a Thursday and quickly struck up a conversation with Derek the bartender. Turns out he's a local from the neighborhood and he filled me in on what's worth checking out. \\n\\nWith a divey vibe to this place and a limited menu of delicious comfort food, you can't go wrong. I had the house pinot grigio and nachos with all the fixins and it hit the spot! With a penny frosted bar and friendly service along with live music, karaoke, board games and trivia on a weekly basis, I find myself easily becoming a regular here! Lucky for them, that is ;)  And I hear they're serving brunch now too! \\n\\nYipppeeee!\", u\"I actually enjoy coming here. The drinks and prices are fine. Food is decent and accessible after 5. People from this hood are cool and friendly... diverse. One small issue and one bigger one and a few others: \\n\\n1. During the summer heat, the 'vintage' couch in the front seems to smell. \\n\\n2. The bartender (the one who kind of looks like Louie CK) seems pretty nice.... but always asks me to put up a tab ... a few moments later, he did the same w / two black men as well. The other whites that came in the bar after me WERE NOT ASKED THIS. I'm white as well and nerdy looking AF.... so maybe I'm reading this wrong. But bartender clearly asked me and the  two black men for a card and to pay promptly. The two white guys... were getting drinks w out paying or having a card on tab. \\n\\n3. This bar ain't no CIELLO .... But if you need to keep cards on tab, then why not do the same to EVERYONE. \\nI probably make more money than the other white guy sitting next to me. \\n\\n4. The bartender is ---(redacted since it was too rude and unnecessary ... other than the predictions that he had of his customers.....bartender Louie, you're lucky I left some of this stuff out.... so I hope you have learned a lesson. Now watch he's going to be even more defiant in the future.) \\n\\n5. Now I can't come here when he's here after posting this :(\", u\"Hard to get a vibe on this place.  The decor screams dive, but the food and cocktail menu suggest they want to be something more.  Prices are decent, with beer being a bit cheaper than normal and hard liquor being more expensive.\\n\\nThe place is definitely low key during the week, but I can't speak for the weekend crowd. Supposedly there's free popcorn, but I've never seen the machine in operation.  Maybe it's a weekend thing?\", u'Heads up, Thursday is trivia night! My buddy and I went down for trivia night, which is hosted by this sick band, and we had such a fun time! Drinks are well priced, the atmosphere is light and fun. We ordered 2 drinks a piece and it only ran us about $12 with tip. \\n\\nThe trivia was a blast, really fun host and a rest backing band. Will be back again!', u\"Have been here in person and also ordered from seamless - both times, i really enjoyed it. \\n\\nThe bar has a 90s school classroom feel (if that makes sense at all?). Bartenders are very friendly, music is decent and there's board games and free popcorn (bonus!). Drinks are pretty reasonably priced. Not the most creative menu, but they can definitely make your standard mixed drink. There are always tables available and they have a patio open during the warmer months. \\n\\nFood is good - I had wings (hot and BBQ) and they were very, very good. My friends had the totchos and the mac n cheese. Totchos are amazing but the mac n cheese was pretty dry.\\n\\nOne of the best parts is they're open super late. It's a solid spot if you're looking for somewhere to post up in Prospect Lefferts!\", u\"I love this place! It's so honey and everyone is so accommodating!! I especially dig Frank! He's the sweetest :-)\", u\"Came here around 11:45 sat at the bar. They have other seating but place wasn't packed. Came with one friend  and other was a few minutes away. We were on a mission for wings and didn't want to go so far. Came on Yelp and saw this place. Pros- drinks are OK. Fairly priced, honey buffalo wing was good, jerk wing was OK, seasoning was good but didn't want them baked.  Bartender tried to help a negative situation but giving a free beer.  Con's - my friend arrived literally 2 minutes after our order was placed and it was last call. Bartender took his order and came back and said cook won't cook your order. Like seriously how hard would it have been to make more wings.  Douchebag.  The order size of my tots was extremely small for the price. Not worth it.\", u'Place was not busy early NYE, and party of 3 sat at the bar. The bartender greeted us promptly, and offered us menus. There was a quiet couch seating area and a handful of tables and chairs throughout. There was a DJ station playing some hits too so it was a nice ambiance. \\n\\nThe menu is simple with typical bar food from burgers, tacos, chips and guacamole, to jerk chicken. They have a quick hit menu \"beer and burger\" etc. which makes ordering easier - these come with stout or lager. The stout was nice. I ordered the burger, and it came out a little too salty, but well cooked. It came with a side salad, but the kitchen made a mistake and brought me a full salad. The bartender gave it to me anyway. \\n\\nMy party order chips and guacamole, and the guacamole was a little too salty as well. Side of tots was fried well, no complaints. \\n\\nOverall, decent place, that I would come back to for drinks and maybe bar food. Pleasant environment that could easily get busy and fun filled.', u\"I've come here a few times for happy hour with coworkers. I usually get a hard cider or a gin and tonic. Drinks are reasonably priced, they serve free popcorn, and they have board games! I looooove to drink while eating popcorn and playing board games. I'm also a fan of tatter tots and they have regular and nachos style. Both are amazing. Plus, staff is friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend this place for happy hour.\", u'ROACHES! a huge Roach crawled up from under the bar right in front of me and was chillin! I jumped up and told the bartender and he was like \"word?\" Then proceeded to do other stuff.... unconcerned.....while the Roach continued to parlay. I paid my tab and bounced. Oh, and a few other things:\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a moderately busy Monday night but they weren\\'t slammed and yet:\\n\\n1. ROACHES\\n\\n2. Someone next to me had been waiting over an hour for some Pasteles and wings \\n\\n3. My burger came out like a lump of coal. I asked for medium. It was disgusting but I ate it, before I noticed the Roach, of course. \\n\\n4. Hard to get the bartenders attention... even on a not so busy night. \\n\\n5. You will leave smelling like burnt burgers, tater tots and ROACHES! I just did laundry and now I can\\'t even wear this sweater another time. Literally just put it on fresh out the dryer to go grab a beer and burger. \\n\\nI know this is a divey bar but they can do better. If ROACHES are on the bar, imagine how many are probably in those old ass couches they have?!?! \\n\\nBrb...taking 10 showers.', u\"I'm writing this review as I sit on toilet for the fourth time after eating the nastiest veggie burger the night before from this place. I ordered from ubereats and the food came hot, but the burger was a mushy mess, lettuce was wilted, and the avocado was so brown, I couldn't even recognize it. The best part of the meal was the fries and bread the burger came on. I would NEVER eat here again. I wish I could give it zero stars.\", u'Came in on a Monday night, me and a couple of friends wanted to eat and enjoy the football game... here\\'s what happened...\\n\\nWe ordered 2 burgers, an order of wings and tater tots... \\nOne burger was well done, while one was undercooked, had to send it back and decided to order wings instead. The \"well done\" burger was almost burnt and they forgot the cheese. When asked for the cheese, they threw the slices on there and didn\\'t melt it. \\n\\nThe tots and wings were supposed to be a meal, served together... but instead, the bartender forgot the tots and brought them out 15 mins later. At least they were hot\\n\\nWings were good, nice crispy, smokey flavor (best part of the meal).\\n\\nThe service was slow... and the place was not crowded. \\n\\nThe last time we patronized this place was in May-June and the food was good. The bartender said there\\'s a new chef... maybe not a good idea. My friend used to love the burger... now, not so much.\\n\\nOhhh... and the ventilation sucks, so you might leave smelling like chicken grease.', u'Nice place for a drink, but avoid the food. Ordered fish and chips which took over an hour and a half to arrive. The bar tender did apologize. But when it finally came it was a very small portion (about 3 tiny fish sticks worth, not a \"fillet\" as described), it was cold, and a little greasy. Not worth $12 even for New York prices.', u'Love this place. Chill out spot where you know food is always good and drinks are on point.\\nBartender knows your name kind of place.\\nFood and drinks are reasonably priced!\\nMac and cheese balls! Yummmy!\\nAlways have a great time here!', u\"+\\n- I like what they are trying to do, introduce new liquors to the community\\n\\n-\\n- Not a very big variety, there were a lot of drinks that the bartender 'did not make' or 'have the ingredients for'...simple stuff like mimosa or amaretto sour\\n\\n-\\n- The drink menu is 26 individual cards, and it's one deck. So if somebody is using it, you just have to wait\\n- I would have appreciated a more extensive food list, but they're young. There's time to grow\\n- The day I went, there were a lot of 'pepe the frog' types in here\", u'First time I went to Westbury Inn, I had a really overpriced, underwhelming draft: $7 for a cider at 3 in the afternoon.\\n\\nThe second time I went, I ordered nothing but my friend was hungry. She ordered food. Almost 30 minutes later, someone came back and asked us if we\\'d gotten our food yet. Table was empty. We said no. They said \"it\\'s on its way out\" and brought us popcorn. Another fifteen minutes passed and no food. They had never put in the order.', u\"This place is adorable!! It's the perfect 'home' bar--the drinks are super cheap, they have a bunch of games you can choose from and play, they serve food pretty late and the staff here is super nice. \\n\\nThis bar is exactly what the neighborhood needs. It's super welcoming and fun, you can watch a NFL game or sit outside in the back and enjoy the weather.\", u\"Great place to have a drink and a bite without feeling like you need to impress anyone. Dereck is a great bartender, and is seamlessly able to handle a full bar. They have tater tots made vegan that are awesome, and a pretty decent burger according to my husband. Also, they won't put too big of a dent on your bank account.\", u'This used to be one of our regular spots but we rarely go anymore. The food continues to fail and they recently fired the best bar tender there for no apparent reason. Lame.', u'I love frank and Emilio. They provide the most welcoming experience at the Westbury by far. These guys make hanging at the westbury like home'], u'82.Surfish Peruvian Bistro': [u'Most amazing Peruvian restaurant i have been to. \\nIm a foodie. \\nThe 3rd ave location on BK has 2 floors of elegant but sexy casual decor. \\nAmazing service, drinks made from scratch, and THE BEST CEVICHE ive had in BK or Manhattan! I highly recommend the ceviche, the Zapallitos, Grilled Prawns, Grilled Skirt Steak for those who venture into the world of the insides of the animal, Anticuchos  are amazing! \\n\\nTruly a legit, great service, great vibe, incredible food  and of course the traditional Pisco cocktails or straight up a full baR!\\nMy absolute favorite spot!', u\"I really had high hopes for this place, with a decent amount of good reviews and delicious looking pictures, I was excited to try, however even though the food was okay, it definitely could have been better.\\n\\nEnvironment/Service: Very spacious place and decorations were simple yet lovely. Our waitress only paid attention to us to take our orders and that was all we heard from her. However, she was constantly friendly and chatty with the table right next to us. It's not a great feeling when service is not shown equally among other customers. \\n\\nFood was served at a relatively fast paced manner. My friend and I ordered tapas and right after we finished our tapas, our entree came out. I personally really enjoyed the tapas more than the entree itself. We ordered three things on the menu.\\n\\n1) CEVICHE MIXTO: Probably one of my favorite dishes of them all. You get a mixture of seafood from shrimp, fish, mussel, and octopus. It was extremely fresh and the lime sauce served with it was amazing. It canceled it any sign of fishiness. Definitely something I'll come back for. \\n\\n2) MUSSELS: The mussels itself were relatively small, but there's a lot. It was really good in the beginning, but the more you eat, the saltier it got. Maybe lessen the salt and I would have enjoyed it even more. \\n\\n3) BLACK PAELLA: My first time trying squid ink and I was excited to try. You basically get a mixture of seafood served with squid ink rice. Oh man, on my first initial bite, all I can say was DAMN IT IS SALTY! I had to consume water after each bite and I didn't want to eat anymore because it was way too salty for my liking. Bummer. \\n\\nOnly thing I really enjoyed was the Ceviche. Although the food was too salty for my liking, I'm still willing to come back and try other things on the menu and hoping I would have a better experience. Even if I don't come back for the food, definitely will come back to sit by the bar and have a drink because the bartender was handsome! Haha!\", u'I had such high hopes for this place, unfortunately, it has failed to deliver TWICE! Thus giving credence to my protrayal.\\n\\nSpace: \\nRelatively large space;  there are two levels,  it accommodate a large bar and has great street view, really beautiful at night. The decor is nice, lighting is perfect!\\n\\nFood:\\nI have tried many things on the menu  most of which were good. I recommend the ceziche tasting. I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s the best that I\\'ve had but you shouldn\\'t be disappointed. The food\\'s good, not great.\\n\\nService:\\nOh Lord, I don\\'t even know where to start; huge disappointment! Coming here, on both occasions, the restaurant was close to empty. This make sense given that it\\'s on 3rd Ave, and probably doesn\\'t get as much traffic. Thus being the perfect opportunity to provide amazing customer service but what we got was something totally different. I literally watched a live telenovela on my last visit. \\n\\nThe waitress seated us and paid is  completely no mind after that. Even tho the restaurant was close to empty she never came to take our drink orders. The bartender noticed our agitation and started taking our orders. Soon after the waitress started screaming at him (speaking in Spanish); my friend told me she was calling the guy a thief. The pair took the arguing outside, in front of the restaurant for all to see. At this time the fight became physical. The waitress started pushing the guy and she was crying uncontrollably; she were so loud you could still here her from inside. The guy walked away and she ran after him and started pulling him... Lol! I couldn\\'t believe what the heck was happening. All this time our drinks weren\\'t being made, and so one of the other servers had to make the drinks for my table. When he came over, I asked what the hell was going on, he replied by saying \"the B**ch is crazy\" and then took our orders. We watched the bartend ride off on his bicycle, never to return and she remained outside. The service never picked up, unfortunate, because the two knuckle heads had left. When we exited the resident she was still standing outside on her phone... Crazy!\\n\\n\\nOne good thing was that the two guys that were left sang me a nice happy birthday with the beating of drum. I mean I\\'ll take it... It was my birthday after all.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t make this up even if I wanted to!', u'loved the original location on 5th Ave and am so glad they expended since the original location is tiny. This location is spacious, does not have a ridiculous wait time and is easier to find street parking. The food are beautifully plated but can be a tad bit salty (my fish plate at least). Service is attentive and the drinks are delicious.', u\"Good food and service. They even had a live music band playing! We tried the zucchini shrimp, steak, mussels and tacos tapas. The steak and mussels were my favorite. The fish tacos weren't anything extraordinary so probably wouldn't get those again. Portion sizes are great for the tapas. Their pisco sours are meh. A little on the pricey side so I would save this place for a nice dinner out.\", u\"Had a great meal here on a week night. \\nService was very quick. Cocktails were good. \\nI definitely enjoyed the appetizers way more than my main dish. I got the squid ink paella and thought it was just okay... not the best I've had. My favorite appetizers were the tuna tartare and the octopus ceviche. These were perfect summer dishes that I would return for. I also enjoyed the prawns (although I wish they were peeled lol), the fish taquitos, and the grilled oysters. My boyfriend ordered the rib eye as his main and thought it was okay. I think if I come back, I'd definitely go for the appetizers, ceviches and cocktails.\", u\"I've loved Surfish ever since the first bite of the Pineapple Tuna ceviche at the original location on 5th Ave. \\n\\nI didn't even know they'd opened up on 3rd until we wandered by recently, and just as with the other location, the flavors are on point, the food is beautiful (seriously gorgeous plating), and the service is excellent. Cobble together a light meal of ceviche and salad on a hot day, or get down with the entra\\xf1a and eggs for brunch, it's a glorious way to kill a hangover. You won't be disappointed.\\n\\nBut what I want to talk about right now is the Ostras a la Piedra.\\n\\nI used to live in New Orleans, and chargrilled oysters are a staple of many menus in that fair city. For some reason, nobody makes them around here. These oysters are the closest thing I've found in NYC (even with the latin flair of the huacatay sauce), and although they are a little pricey, they are far less than a plane ticket to the dirty south. \\n\\nI'll be back for more.\", u\"Wow wow wow, what a gem. Surfish was just an incredible meal. The food is so flavorful, fresh, and well presented for the price point. The actual restuarant shows some wear and tear but the food is immaculate. \\n\\nI visited on a date on a Monday afternoon. It was pretty empty especially considering it has 2 floors and a rooptop. They play upbeat latin music.\\n\\nI started off with the pisco sour; very refreshing. Next I had the ceviche tasting (the reason I came) i loved 2 out of the 3. The hamachi tuna was the best. It was slightly tart and the aji sauce was realllllly good I ended up dipping the rest of my food in the leftover sauce. The pineapple tuna was also banging. The octopus I didnt love but it wasnt bad. They came with these gray chips idk what they were made out of but they were crunchy and delicious.\\n\\nI also tried pollada entree. It is a pretty sizable entree and like everything else here: f'n delicious. \\n\\nOur waiter was really nice and Peruvian so he gave us really good recommendations. I will definitely be coming back here to try everything on their menu.\", u\"I've never had Peruvian food before and since this place had high reviews I decided to stop by and finally try it for myself.\\n\\nWe showed up at 5:30 pm on a saturday (no reservation) and was seated immediately since the place was practically emptied. It's a decent space and they have 2 floors but if you are coming with a big party, definitely call ahead and make a reservation.\\n\\nThe menu was pretty extensive with lots of ceviches and tapas to choose from. We ended up sharing 4 tapas and ordered a main entree for my daughter.\\nTapas:\\nChicharron sliders ($13) - it was disappointing. First thing that comes to mind when I see chicharron is FRIED PORK. This tasted more like BBQ shredded pull-pork, no crispy skin, no crunch what-so-ever to it. Too mushy of a combo for my taste.\\n\\nMussels ($14) - The mussels were on the small side but it does come in a big bowl. More than enough as a meal. As I started eating, it tasted great and I was pleased. But as I got to the middle where it sat in broth, my tongue started to tingle from the salt. Definitely way too salty which was a waste because I would have loved to dip my bread into the broth.\\n\\nRibs ($13) - This was probably the best dish out of the 4 we got. The meat was super tender, fall off the bone goodness. It is a saucy rib, not a dry one but it is a little over salted again. Or maybe it's still from those damn mussels...\\n\\nGrilled skirt steak ($15) - asked for medium and it came out medium rare. Not a problem, my husband ate most of the center where it was too bloody for me. The steak was good but again drenched in sauce and the sauce was too salty. (I'm beginning to notice a theme here...)\\n\\nRisotto de Camarones ($23) - don't be mistaken, this is not the black paella, we ordered the shrimp risotto for my daughter. This was probably the only dish that was not overly salty. The shrimp portion was generous with almost a piece of shrimp for every other bite. It's a big portion too, so enough for 2 people to share. Only con is the risotto was way too undercooked. There is a difference between al dente and undercook rice and this was definitely not al dente. \\n\\nYou also get a complimentary plaintain chip (2 kinds) with salsa and a sauce. It was really good and salsa was fresh. I think we all liked this complimentary dish the most!\\n\\nSo overall, I say the meal was TOO SALTY. The service was fine, our server was attentive enough as the place got crowded. I won't say write this place off just yet because I think they have potentially good dishes to be had. Maybe just ask for sauce on the side.\", u\"Delicious! \\n\\nThis is my boyfriend and my favorite date night spot. We've taken parents here, we taken other fiends here. It's to versatile to any kind of occasion your looking to do! \\n\\nWe've gotten exclusively tapas with a few friends and it worked out really well. Their ceviche is to die for. \\n\\nWe've also done just entrees with the parents (of course with ceviche appetizers) and everyone was pleased. \\n\\nI just wish their happy hour ran a little later, I believe right now it's ends at 6p\", u\"I tried Surfish for the first time last night and it was amazing!\\n\\nFirst off - the staff is so friendly and accommodating, they truly made the night easy and fun.  Surfish is a pretty casual restaurant, but people check in on you the perfect amount so you have what you need, but aren't caught mid-bite, etc.\\n\\nThe food was PHENOMENAL!  I will come back here soon, and likely ordering for take out since I live around the corner.\\n\\nThe meal started with complimentary plantain chips with two types of salsas - both yummy and fresh.\\n\\nWe ordered the fish taquitos, corvino and paella.  Everything was so full of flavor and texture - the fish was all cooke perfectly, and the paella had an abundance of really tender, juicy seafood.\\n\\nHighly recommend Surfish - your tummy will leave happy!\", u\"Honestly the place is spotless \\nDecore is 5 stars \\nCleanliness is 5 stars\\nService is 5 stars \\nBar is 5 stars \\nFood is 3 stars, its okay I've had excellent Peruvian food and found this place a little bland. I ate here 4 times \\n\\nIts a nice place just wish the food was not so bland.\", u\"I've been to the old location before and was excited to visit again at the new location. Food is still the same, but the atmosphere is much nicer and bigger.\\n\\nEverything here hits the spot and seafood is super fresh. I just love all the ceviche options here. My favorite is the Hamachi ceviche-- so flavorful. I was kind of hoping to see some uni on the menu like pictured in some of the photos, but I didn't. Maybe it was a seasonal thing?\\n\\nSquid ink paella was good, but I've had better. I would probably order something else as an entr\\xe9e next time. Overall, this place has become one of my fave Peruvian spots around!\\n\\nMmmmm pisco soursssssss.\", u'Service was great and so was the decor and atmosphere. Unfortunately the chupe de camarones shrimp soup was very salty and not very traditional it had cherry tomatoes, no cheese or Peruvian corn in it!! Thats not the Peruvian way at all. We also had the lomo saltado, also very salty. Such a shame was expecting more from this place... prices are pretty high for medium size portions.', u\"We came here on Monday afternoon and was a bit disappointed to see that they had a different menu from their other location in Park Slope. A meal for 3 people costed $100 which didn't really seem worth it, in my opinion- our meal took a little while to come. This place is relatively quiet and do have an upstairs as well. Overall- I would probably stick to the other location, although this menu seems to be more extensive. \\n\\nChicha Morada $3: 3/5 This is a peruvian purple corn drink. It looked really pretty and had a slight fruity after taste to it which I liked, but you also taste the corn. I probably wouldn't order this again because i'm not a huge fan of corn. \\n\\nBrussels Sprouts $6: 3/5 Nothing spectacular- tasted like soy sauce with brussels sprouts. This was still good though.\\n\\nPineapple Tuna $15- 3/5 This plate is relatively small and the ahi tuna didn't taste as fresh. The pineapple and peanuts tasted better. In my opinion this was definitely not worth $15. \\n\\nToro con palta $15- 3/5 This dish was pretty and placed on a granite looking rock plate but the same with the tuna- it had a fishy taste and didn't seem fresh. The tuna was sort of soggy and stuck together.. however, the sauce with it was good. \\n\\nSalmon $23- 4/5 This plate was on the smaller side, but still filling. Apparently it comes with shrimp. But I only found 1 piece of shrimp hiding inside the mash potato. I would have forgot that they even served it with shrimp, had I not discover it until the very end.  The salmon was decent- but tasted like any other salmon. There was just enough sauce to dip the salmon and mash potatoes with. The mash potatoes were good and fluffy.\", u\"I've driven past Surfish tons of times but have never really stopped to take a look or anything. When a friend suggested meeting here for dinner on a random week night, I was all in for it. I arrived early and the bartender saw me hovering awkwardly outside the restaurant so he came outside and offered me a seat at the bar. No pressure to order or a drink or anything too! \\n\\nWhen my friend arrived, we were seated promptly, even though we were over our reservation time. They brought out some complimentary plantain chips with pico de gallo and a delicious green aji chili sauce. The green sauce was so good!! \\n\\nWe both went with the grilled hanger steak with rice and grilled plantains. It was so good!! The plantains were super sweet and brought a nice contrast to the savory steak. \\n\\nWe ended the night by splitting an order of churros, which comes with a side of chocolate dipping sauce and vanilla ice cream. So good!! \\n\\nService was attentive without being overbearing and we both had a great time catching up (we haven't seen each other in a longgg time).\", u\"I was hesitant about coming here since several reviews mentioned service delays but the food pics looked so good that I said, oh what the heck, let's try it.  The service turned out to be excellent.  The waitstaff were amazing -- very attentive, helpful and friendly.  They were constantly coming up to check on us.  Actually, it was even a bit too much attention.  Perhaps the waitstaff changed or they were schooled on service.  Our waitress was excellent and there were two other women walking around checking in on every table.  The food was absolutely amazing -- every dish that we had was extremely flavorful with great presentation.  I definitely recommend the huge grilled prawns, paella with squid ink rice, and mussels in the bacon marinade.\", u\"Oh my yum!! Everything that I tried here was delicious and we went heavy on ordering! It seemed like we got one of everything on the menu! It is a tapas place so you're recommended to get a bunch of things and share between the group. We came here with a group of 4 for date night. The drinks were delicious and our waitress was very pleasant & helpful! \\n\\nThe pineapple tuna ceviche was amazing\\nThe fried oysters to die for - and I actually really don't like oysters in general \\nCarnitas Tacos - YESSS!!!\\nThe short ribs - amazingggg\\nThe steak & the sliders were perfection!!\\nThe shrimp risotto was really delicious but def extra at this point because I was so full & wanted to save room for dessert.\\n\\nDefinitely will be returning to this delicious spot!! Not to mention their sangria was yuuuuummmm & had a good amount of alcohol in it!\", u'Arrived on a Sunday night and was seated right away. Staff were very chill and accommodating. Ceviche was fresh and delicious, I love their variety of ceviche options here, I wanted to order them all. For appetizer I ordered their ceviche tasting; pineapple tuna, mixto, and toro con plata. The mixto was the best out of the three. It was very citrusy and slightly smokey. The toro con plata was my least favorite but overall it was still good. For the entree I ordered lomo saltado and Pollada both were delicious but was slightly on the saltier side. I will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu. Good food make you sleepy so be prepared!', u'Wow,  I will just start by saying that, the food here is delectable.\\n\\nI knew that this was going to be a good one and by no means was I disappointed. When everyone at the table loves their dish you know that this place is good!!\\n\\nWe arrived at Surfish on a beautiful Summer afternoon. We did not have a reservation but we were quickly seated anyway. Just a note if you are planning to eat here I would suggest a reservation. I can see that this place probably gets crowded and it would be helpful to have one.  I think we were lucky grabbing a table as quickly as we did.\\n\\nNow onto the food! We did not order any appetizers but they will bring out plantain chips with pico de gallo and a delicious green aji chili sauce, which is essentially a green chile sauce. We could not get enough of that sauce! For lunch/dinner we ordered as follows:\\n\\nTaquitos Carnitas\\nSalmon\\nEntrana tacu tacu\\nAnd an additional side of tacu tacu\\n\\nEverything was amazing point blank period. The presentation was gorgeous and the food tasted oh so good. The pork in the taquitos was delicious. The salmon was perfection. The steak was tender. I could not complain about one thing. Notably the tacu tacu was superb. Tacu tacu is the Peruvian version of rice & beans and it was... wow. I was extremely impressed with everything that we had. The service was friendly and attentive. I also ordered a glass of Chardonnay which was very good as well. They do have a nice wine/bar selection here too. I really want to come back and try the shrimp risotto next time! I would without a doubt recommend this place!!!'], u'83.Wanisa Home Kitchen': [u'Wanisa Home Kitchen does Thai food right. Was looking for a late night meal and although we came in with only 20 minutes before the restaurant closed, they still were happy to seat us. The staff here is really nice and once we ordered, it did not take long for the food to come out. \\n\\nThe Thai Basil Fried Rice was delicious. If you like spicy, you will like this. I got it with tofu, which was cooked to my liking. My BF, a staunch meat eater tried some and commented on how he actually liked the tofu with this dish. I also got to try some of the cashew sauce with chicken. The sauce is really good, and reminds me of a sweet teriyaki sauce. \\n\\nBy the time we were done eating, it was almost an hour past closing and at no point did we feel like we were being rushed out. Our waitress continued to fill our water glasses and ask us if we needed anything else. For the price (about $10 per dish) and the hospitality I would definitely come back or recommend Wanisa.', u\"Placed an order for pickup via Yelp. I went with the BBQ pork that came with rice and some veggies on the side. I needed a quick meal to eat in transit, but they didn't give me any damn utensils. Had to eat the pork with my hands and forewent the rice. The rice was also semi-sticky and a tiny saran wrapped brick inside a larger box. Meat portions were pretty generous though. It came with two sides of sauce - one was the standard sweet chili sauce you can pick up at most grocery stores, and the other was the hot sauce. The hot sauce was damn good. The restaurant space itself was renovated really well, but seemed pretty dead on a Thursday.\", u\"The pad thai (spicy) is AMAZING. This restaurant is family owned, the ingredients are fresh and unique. The staff is welcoming and the fact that it's cozy and cute is a plus (great for a date). I loved it here, I thought the food was excellent and everything exceeded my expectations.\", u'Very nice home feeling Thai cuisine. Nothing extraordinary special, but once in a while it is nice to have something that really stays true to its original flavor. The drunken noodle is a bit too mild, I would give it a five if they can kick the spice up a notch. Green curry with chicken is really delicious and have all the right ingredients in it. For someone who is not a big fan of egg plants, I find it extremely tasty in the green curry. Highly recommend if you feel the urge for a meal of simple yet delicious Thai food on any day.', u\"I'm notoriously picky when it comes to Thai, so 5 stars means a lot. This space just opened up in Boerum Hill on Smith and not only was the food delicious (I got the Pad Sew--super fresh and not overly oily) but the server was so nice and accommodating--the kind of service that West Coast natives like me opine about missing once they get to NYC. The decor is also lovely, with wood panels that line every wall and flowers on the tables. Will definitely be back.\", u\"Came here for dinner tonight to try it because wanisa just opened. We really enjoyed it, veg was super fresh with the right amount of crunch. \\nWe got the panang and masuman Currys, pad see ew wth shrimp and a side of peanut sauce and a side of veg. Bill was 37 bucks. It's was really nice we will go back I'm sure. They have no alcohol yet or it's byob we weren't sure to be honest.\", u\"Delivery: we phoned in, everyone was so pleasant on the phone, and they threw in a Pad Thai just to make friends (it worked!). \\nChicken laarb was great-- spicy, cool and fresh. SamTam salad was also super --papaya tasted really clean. Not as spicy or dried shrimpy as I like, but easily remediable. Crying Tiger beef was basically a delicious marinated steak-- cooked to specs, tender-- and some mild, good side sauce. Spicy seafood combo was generous, well rounded flavor but not super spicy. \\nVegetable Pad Thai was remarkably plain. Not something I'd order again, but was an experiment anyway. \\nFingers crossed that Wanisa focuses on the funky and hot end of Thai cuisine; Brooklyn had enough oversimplified drunken noodle already. Bring on the chili and the fish sauce! Bring on the dried shrimp and and sour sausage! \\nDelivery was quick, too!\", u\"This restaurant is great! \\n\\nMy husband and I live in the neighborhood and have tried all the Thai restaurants. Wanisa is new and we thought we'd give it a try. We were really impressed-in fact, this place may have just beat our favorite local Thai restaurant! We ordered the spicy eggplant, green curry, and pad thai. Everything was so flavorful, fresh, perfectly spiced, (not greasy) and very authentic and delicious. Also, it had a great vibe and the service was so sweet and kind. We will definitely be coming back!\", u'Phenomenal food. Ordered the papaya salad, green curry, and pad see ew. Their spicy is spicy. Staff is over the top nice. Coming back for sure', u'We ordered 3 dishes. One of the curry beef was unreasonably sweet. Also, the rice was cold and hard. Thought maybe the leftover from last night. Not going back no more.', u'Phenomenal fd. Ordered the Crispy spring roll, Mas-Sa-Man curry, pad see ew & Pineapple Fried Rice. Their spicy is spicy. Staff is over the top nice. Coming back for sure.', u'Overall great food and service. New favorite local Thai food. The crispy pork is so good.', u'Very nice Thai restaurant , fried banana is awesome and the crab meat fried rice is brilliant too', u\"I was skeptical with another Thai restaurant in the neighborhood but this place is really good...surprisingly good. The food isn't drowning in oil and everything tastes so fresh...not like they got a shipment of frozen Thai ingredients from the local distributor. The fried calamari are fresh calamari...not tough rings but big meaty strips, it's delicious. Pad Thai is light and the BBQ pork is actually a boneless pork loin chop. Satay is tender and juicy and my friend raves about the Thai fried rice. The staff is also super friendly and they are very accommodating to food allergies. It's my new favorite Thai place.\"], u'54.MangoSeed Restaurant': [u\"I decided to come to this lovely and small restaurant with a good friend of mine. It's conveniently located in Flatbush, which is the neighborhood that I now live in. It's a small Caribbean themed restaurant and the drinks are lovely.\\n\\nWhen we stopped by, we had to wait for a table. Although we did not eat any food, we were able to enjoy the drinks. Well that night, drinks were on me so I decided to order a few. \\n\\nOur waitress was very sweet and accompanying. I love patronizing black owned businesses and I would say that the service is superb. The waitresses, bartenders and hostess were very pleasant and accommodating.\\n\\nP.S., I forgot all about this draft last year!\", u\"I have very mixed feelings about Magoseed. I absolutely love the service, but for some reason everything I eat from there is so damn spicy. How do you have only jerk wings and no bbq chicken? the fish taco is SPICY (fire hose required). The only thing NOT spicy is the baked macaroni pie. That I must say is great and motherwatering not peppered up. Everything else requires TUMS or MILK to sooth the burning you will get from heart burn. I have never had heart burn so bad in my 39 years of living. \\n\\nI think I will stick with their sister restaurant ZuriLee Restaurant 2 doors down. NOW they have great service, pizza and drinks.\\n\\nCONS: \\n1. NOT to many selections on the menu \\n2. Drinks are watered down even when it's not happy hour\\n3. Back is closed for construction. (how do you decide to have construction in the summer?)\\n\\nPROS:\\n1. SERVICE\\n2. Mac and Cheese (even left overs are good)\\n3. They don't take long with your order\\n4. NOT loud on weekdays\\n5. They accept YELP complimentary drink for your review\\n6.HAPPY HOUR happens twice a day\", u\"In your mind's eye, what would be the perfect rendition of Oxtail? Would it be melt-in-your-mouth tender? Some perfect blend of gravy and jus to coat the meat, making it juicy and punch-full of flavor? Would it make you close your eyes to savor each taste? Amazing (crazily!) this rendition exists at MangoSeed and the portion size is humongous, too. It's worth the hour trip out to Flatbush from Manhattan for this dish.\\n\\nBUT WAIT! Don't forget the Jerk Chicken because is also ahhh-mazing. It tastes like the best rotisserie chicken and it is fall-off-the-bone perfect. \\n\\nTheir happy hour cocktails are strong, too. I will return in a stretchy dress very soon.\", u\"I think I've slept on Mangoseed. I first came in 2014 and didn't enjoy the 3 sides I threw together for an entree to make up for the lack of vegetarian options. I also found it pricey for what I was getting. \\n\\nThat said, I've returned twice since and the winner here is happy hour. It's low key and has a nice vibe. They also do double happy hour which is dope. 4-7 and then 10-close. The drinks and strong and cheap and there's a complimentary shot with Yelp check-in.\", u\"I went here on a date as I was looking for somewhere close by in East Flatbush. To be completely honest, if I were to do it again, I probably would not have chosen this place for a first date as the music was pounding from the minute we walked in the door. I mean to the point where by the time I left, my ears were ringing. \\n\\nDespite that, my date and I went along with it and and screamed over the loud music. When it came time to order, I wanted the jerk chicken with rice, but apparently they were out of the rice and peas (I'm not sure how!?) and the waiter recommended the jerk salad again. I was sad to forego the rice and peas but I figured, maybe this was nature's way of telling me I need to cut down my carbs. \\n\\nThe salad was good, well dressed with a tasty vinaigrette. The jerk chicken was pretty standard, but nothing too special compared to all the Caribbean places nearby. My date got their burger which I thought was pretty tasty - came with a flavorful chipotle sauce. But again, just an average burger, nothing to write home about. Gave this place 3 stars because you can get a solid meal here but for their prices I think i expected a little more.\", u'Had such an amazing brunch here with a friend... $15 unlimited mimosas in more than enough flavors. I had 3 flavors, all delicious! I got mac and cheese with a fried egg and a side of Parmesan grits. Man... just delicious. Especially the mac and cheese. VERY rich but not overwhelmingly so. Loved it. My server was also very attentive and polite. They have an inside and outside area. A good DJ for brunch. Will definitely be back again.... and again.... and again!', u\"I don't have anything bad to say about Mangoseed. I just wish I could find parking without having to drive around for hours but it's so worth it. Don't blink or you will miss it. \\n\\nThis time I had their three cheese macaroni and cheese and the jerk chicken salad. The macaroni was super flavorful but mixed well. I wish they used a different type of pasta. But we still ate every bite and savored it!  My jerk chicken salad was also delicious and fresh! I loved every bite I just wish there was more substantive salad and not just greens. \\n\\nThis is my 3rd or 4th meal here. I will definitely be back! Make sure to ask for separate checks before you start eating or things can get a little\\nConfusing\", u\"My sister took me here for my birthday, and long story short... the food was amazing! The service was great! Staff was very fast and attentive. Food came out in a timely fashion and when my sister told them it was my birthday they gave us free shots on the house. Then brunch menu is good and there is a $15 unlimited mimosa deal. It is located on Flatbush where parking is a nightmare, but I'm definitely looking forward to trying dinner! They music selection was great as well! I was dancing in my seat!\", u'Okay, so I\\'ve officially been brought over to the MangoSeed side. I\\'m not going to lie, I\\'ve been resistant to them since they\\'ve open for quite some time. I have a \"thing\" about going out to eat at establishments whose cuisine I can cook. \\nSo if anything else, COME FOR THE HAPPY HOUR!! Mon-Fri 4-7 then 10-until close. My drink to date is the Sugar Cane Lemonade. It is hella refreshing and it gets the job done simultaneously!\\nSo I\\'ve never gotten around the main dishes because I\\'m absolutely in love with the jerk fish tacos and the mac and cheese. The jerk fish tacos is actually made with salmon and the shell is dipped in beet juice to give it that bright red color so technically clean eating. (I know what I said, dont judge.) The mac n\\' cheese is an easy HIT. It\\'s not your average mac n cheese with one of the cheeses is smoked gouda. I\\'m literally thinking about the next time I can go without feeling bad as I type.......', u\"We came here for Sunday brunch and I highly recommend it!! \\n\\n// Brunch\\nThe food is absolutely delicious. We had the jerk chicken with waffles and the everything toast. The spices on the jerk chicken were perfect and I was surprised at how light and fluffy the waffle was. The bit of banana and whip cream on top added just the right amount of sweetness. The everything toast was much more substantial than we expected. A huge, thick piece of toast covered with the egg, veg and pastrami salmon. For anyone who hasn't had pastrami salmon before, it's kind of what you'd expect: looks like smoked salmon but tastes like pastrami. We're not small eaters but neither of us could finish our meals even though we tried.\\n\\n// Unlimited Mimosas\\nFor an extra $15 you can get unlimited mimosas. Each person gets a half carafe at the table so you can keep refilling your glass. A half carafe is about 2.5 glasses. And we went through 3 half carafes each in the allowed 1.5 hr time limit. The waitress was extremely quick to refill our carafes but they're very strict about the 2:30pm stop time which is understandable. All of the flavors really just taste like juice except for the classic. However I was drunk by the time my third carafe showed up so I know there was a good bit of alcohol in them. If you want a cold mimosa, I recommend the classic. All of the other flavors came warm. My favorite flavors in order: hibiscus, mango, classic and pineapple, guava.\\n\\n// Cons\\nThe only cons is that it was really dark inside and the music is too loud. When we came out of the restaurant it felt like we had spent all night in a club.\", u\"I was really excited to try this place but unfortunately I didn't like it. Maybe I ordered wrong or maybe I came on the wrong day, I don't know. I came here with my dad tonight and we got the fried chicken, the burger, and a side of plaintains. \\n\\nFirst of all, the prices surprised me. $22 for fried chicken and French fries? It was a big portion but still.... also, it was extreeeemely hot; I could barely eat it. Not spicy, hot. The French fries were soggy, too. The chicken was just pretty flavorless. \\n\\nThe burger wasn't any better. The meat was too thick, and the bun was dry and soggy. It was not good at all, unfortunately. It also came with soggy fries. \\n\\nThe plaintains were the only good thing here.\\n\\nAlso, suuuuper loud music! I could barely hear anything.\", u\"First off, the drinks were on point. I had the passion fruit rum punch and it had a real island flavor that you just don't find any where unless you travel to the Caribbean. Our waiter came really quickly, took our orders in a timely manner and was really nice. The food was so good we had chicken (Jerk and fried) with waffles and ox and grits. The flavors are so good, how they use their spices works well and makes the food extremely tasty. Definitely will be back.\", u\"Amazing brunch menu! Such good comfort food & great mimosa options. Wish the staff was a bit more attentive; I've gone when it was really just and I've gone when it was not and the service is pretty much the same. Really nice hostess though!\", u\"I've been going to Mangoseed for brunch for the past 3-4 years. And to this day it's once of my favorite brunch spots in Brooklyn. This review is long overdue!\\n\\nI always opt for one of 3 entrees: jerk chicken and waffle, jerk salmon and waffle, or the Ox & Parmesan Grits. If I HAD to pick a favorite it would be the Ox & Grits. Always on point and extremely flavorful and fulfilling. A great meal with $15 added on for unlimited mimosas is always a brunch win. They also have a DJ who plays R&B, some hip hop and reggae which sets the tone. In the summertime I suggest sitting in the greenhouse-like back area to soak up a little sun while enjoying your meal. \\n\\nOne important thing to note is the Unlimited mimosa time frame. They STRICTLY end serving the unlimited mimosas at 2:30. Meaning, if you sit down at 2pm you will be limited to 30 mins mimosas time (not 1.5hrs). So make sure you arrive early as this place does get packed!\", u\"Went for Sunday Brunch. Food was delish but service left a lot to be desired. Our water glasses went empty most of the 2 hours we were there, our food took over 30 minutes to arrive and after our server took our order, we saw her ONCE. We had a carafe of guava mimosa, tasty but not very strong (would order again). I had the jerk chicken and waffle, beau had waffle and salmon. The waffles are perfection. Huge, fluffy and bursting with flavor! Jerk chicken was well seasoned too...and falling off the bone. This place could be 5 stars.....Maybe it is when it's not the bustling brunch hour? I might be back...\", u\"Whenever I'm in Brooklyn I try to stop by this place! The food is amazing, service is good & it's in BK, what else is there! This time I dined in I did it with my friends who had never eaten here and they all loved loved loved it afterwards! We will all be coming back again!!\", u'Slow service. But they have the BEST Mac & cheese I ever had in my life !!!! I had the oxtail with rice and spinach. It was good. The oxtail are HUGE ! Good strong rum punch as well. The male bartender was amazing I told him I was allergic to fruit so he came to my table and made sure what I can and cannot have and he made a special drink for me.', u'The food and atmosphere is fantastic. This is definitely a neighborhood staple. These are the same owners of Zurilee. The vibe is fun and the DJ on the weekends makes it a fun place for brunches.\\n\\nThe jerk fish tacos are absolutely amazing and extremely flavorful. Mac and cheese is also a must try. In regards to drinks, nothing beats the rum punch and sorrel cocktail.', u\"Myself and my son love this place ! Literally everything on the menu is great so you can't go wrong , it does get crowded for brunch on Sunday's but it's well worth the wait staff is friendly , the restaurant gives you a island vibe , it's clean the drinks are amazing ., do stop by you won't be disappointed ( try the amazing fish tacos ) thank me later !\", u\"I came here on a date with my boyfriend. It was defiantly intimate. Kind of on the small side but I was happy to support black owned business. I had the salmon with pasta and he had jerk salmon. But the jerk wasn't as spicy as they claimed it to be. Overall we enjoyed our date\"], u'81.Suffolk Arms': [u'With a growling stomach, I went on a rapid yelp search in the area and found this gem! Upon entering, we were greeted and quickly seated.\\n\\nMy friend and I decided to go with some recommendations for food and ended up getting the \"Lower East Side\" burger and the Fish and Chips. The burger comes with guacamole, bacon, Vermont cheddar cheese, AG sauce, lettuce tomato, and onions. IT WAS DELICIOUS!! It was very flavorful and everything blend well together... highly recommended! The Fish and Chips comes with two large pieces of deep fried cod, fries on the side and two dipping sauces.\\n\\nFor drinks, we both decided to get the Hennessy Pina Colada. I loved that it came with a metal straw! I found this to be really unique and practical because it keeps the drink nice and cool as it travels to your mouth. It was also extremely yummy and I could drink this all night long.\\n\\nMy last star is for the amazing service here. Our server continually checked on us to see if we were okay. As we asked for the check, he even gave us two banana daiquiri shots, on the house! I can\\'t wait to come back to try more of their goodies!', u'Seriously my favorite spot to get cocktails in the Lower East Side... scratch that, NYC. \\n\\nGreat staff, hand drawn art on the menus and I\\'ve shazzamed quite a few tracks from whatever tunes they happen to be playing at the moment. I think \"Wah Wah Man\" was the last song I got from there. \\n\\nEverything on their brunch menu is either $5 or $10 and my favorite drink is Tough Room or the Trinidad Sour. \\n\\nI highly recommend a visit. They exude customer experience.', u\"Cool little cocktail bar with a very colonial British sort of vibe. We popped in here for a quick drink while we were waiting for our table for brunch to get ready. The bartender was super sweet and friendly and made some of the nicest brunch cocktails we've had in a while. We got the bellini which was perfect, and a ginger-based slushy type cocktail which was delicious and strong! (I think they use real ginger here). \\n\\nReading the reviews, I feel I'm only seeing a small part of the picture, having not come here at night. Will definitely have to come back here for some drinks at another time!\", u'Excellent place with delicious food, good drinks and nice staff! Telented bartenders! Ask Caitlin to make you the special tea drink with bourbon. As for decor it looks interestig enough. I will return here again. :-)', u\"Apparently this place has been opened for a little over a year! Overwhelming list of cocktails during the Cocktail hour from 4-7pm. With 100 drinks to choose from, we spent a long time trying to decide. \\n\\nWe opted for the strawberry whiskey shake, improved pina colada, treacle, and ready aim fire. We wanted some marshmallow tots too, but they were out. Instead we got the bone marrow and little neck clams.\\n\\nDrinks were phenomenal. Each element shone through in their special way. The improved pina colada was actually really good. Back home, it tastes overly sweet (like someone was too heavy handed with the syrup), but it had a perfect balance here. The strawberry whiskey shake had a bourbon base and it was fruity and citrusy, perfect for the summer. The ready aim fire was spicy if that's your thing. Finally the treacle was smokey and sweet. I loved all the options and if I had better tolerance, would've loved to try some others. Guess there's always next time.\\n\\nThe food is also amazing. The little neck clams came with 3 types of sauces and the bone marrow also came with three sauces. Bone marrow was so rich and buttery with the toast! I'm always sad there's so little. \\n\\nI definitely recommend coming with a group so you can try more drinks!\", u\"Loved this place, from the James Baldwin quote about NYC in the menu to the famous New Yorkers on the walls, excellent cocktails and service, and classy vibe. It followed a lengthy Sunday brunch (elsewhere) with several bloody marys, so drinking here was kept to a relative minimum. I don't remember the name of the cocktail I had, but it was one of their specialties and came with a side shot of prosecco. The short ribs and Thai wings were great. Service was friendly and professional. Will go back another time for a more proper visit. In the meantime, I hope they have fixed the lock on the left bathroom's door, I almost lost a friend in there!\", u\"Cocktails were great, well balanced. Best part is when you order a medium well burger and it actually comes medium well, can't tell you how many places in NYC just can't get it right. Also, there's the Tater-tots to kill for.\", u\"Honest to God, one of the best bars in NYC. Every drink on the menu is fabulous and executed perfectly and precisely. The staff is conversational, knowledgeable, and absolutely lovely. The food is delicious and happy hour specials are unmatched. \\nI cannot recommend this place highly enough. Run run run to this bar! \\nPS- my friend needed an android charger and hey didn't have one, so Rob went out and bought one on the spot. So frickin' sweet.\", u\"This bar is off the hook. Great mixology without the pretension. Everyone working here seems to be having a good time and care about you having a great time as well. The Staff Meal might literally be the best cocktail I've ever had in life. Run here.\", u\"I live a few blocks from this cocktail bar so naturally when I saw a reservation available for a Friday night at 9, I had to give it a try. I wasn't disappointed.\\n\\nThe good:\\n-Pina Colada!!!!!! I have a lot of respect for a cocktail bar that isn't afraid to keep a traditional, no frills drink on the menu. This was FANTASTIC and I gulped it down in no time.\\n-Vodka Espresso: Delicious. One of the best I've had. Not creamy, very tasty.\\n-Disco fries! This isn't quite what I expected, as my usual order of disco fries consists of melted american cheese and gravy, but boyyyy was I excited to eat these. Worth the $16 bucks.\\n\\nThe not so good:\\n-Our first server told us our order included a lot of fries (even after I asked for my burger with a salad). Was that a fat joke? Is there even such a thing as too many fries? Whatever. He was kind of right and we didn't eat the fries that came with my BF's burger but still. Let us make that call.\\n-The Mai Tai. I liked it, my BF thought it was missing grenadine. However, pretty sure it's a no-no to ask a cocktail connoisseur to modify one of their drinks to your liking. So keep in mind it's not as sweet as your typical mai tai.\\n-The burgers: Eh. I guess it was my own mistake for coming to a cocktail bar for dinner. \\n\\nOverall: come here for the drinks and to maybe have some disco fries as a pre-dinner snack. Then go somewhere else for dinner. Then maybe come back for a nightcap. I like this place and I will be back!\", u\"My favorite neighborhood bar! While it may look like any neighborhood pub, Suffolk Arms is so much more. Prepare to be blown away by unpretentious, artful, and delicious cocktails--my personal favorites include Duke of Suffolk (warm milk tea cocktail) and Monarch (fresh, lightly fruity). You can always ask the bartenders to make you a drink based on what you like and they've never disappointed. The staff is attentive and friendly. \\n\\nAnd the food! Everything I've had is delicious and what you want while drinking more cocktails than expected...in the times of gentrified chopped cheeses, Suffolk Arms does it justice with both flavor and price ($5 for a medium sized chopped cheese and fries!).\\n\\nI've loved every time I've come to Suffolk Arms and everyone I've brought has loved it too. In a sea of scene-y bro bars, Suffolk Arms is just the best!\", u\"Great new cocktail lounge to the area. Came here on a Saturday and never got too crowded. Great pace and fast, friendly service. They take reservations which is a bonus. Great selection of food but didn't get to try any this time. $15 cocktails were neither great or bad in comparison to PDT or Death & Co. but enjoyable nonetheless. Old fashioned was properly made and good. Washington Apple was nice and fruity but wish there was more of a spicy/horseradish flavor to it. Bartender made a Paddy? which is similar to an old fashioned which was really good. When we asked for a spicy cocktail, he made a guapo? which had a nice kick to it. Overall, great drinks and very chill atmosphere.\", u'This is a great place to relax and wind down after a long day in the city. They have a menu of over 100 cocktails such as the Old Cuban and Pornstar. The food here is excellent as well. The Fish and Chips is seasoned perfectly and lightly battered that will make your mouth water.', u\"Everything about this place is great! The cocktails and especially their signature cocktails are diverse and tasty. And don't get me started on the short ribs! The vibe is nice, music had me smiling and the staff was very welcoming and attentive.\", u\"I love this place~ wide selection of cocktails, sophisticated yet chill with a LES vibe.\\n\\nTheir coaster is cute!\\n\\nWe also got the food,\\n- Thai chicken wing: 10 wings, such big portion for a bar! Yummy indeed\\n- Sweet potato fries: not bad but I didn't like the cause\\n- Bone Marrow: quite yummy \\n\\nWorth a visit, and I would come back !\", u'\"Patience and Fortitude conquer all things.\" \\n- Ralph Waldo Emerson \\n(and/or Fiorello LaGuardia) \\n\\nFive stars. Hot new bar in LES.\\n\\nCame here on a Friday night (2/19), not realizing they\\'d just opened the night before!  I read an article written in the fall about the bar, but guess the opening had been delayed a bit. It was so nice to experience the place when it\\'s less crazy, because I know in a few weeks it\\'ll be impossible to get in. \\n\\nAlso, when I visited, Giuseppe Gonzalez himself was the bartender!  (\"The very handsome half-Italian half-Puerto Rican\" as Pablo the server described him.)\\n\\nTo drink: \\n\\nThe Tough Room - guinness and whiskey sour. \"Tastes bright and foamy, but unmistakably guinness.\" - Marissa L., my adventurous companion \\n\\nTrinidad Sour - rye, lemon, orgeat, angostura.  If drinks/flavors could have shapes, this drink would taste round. Like a perfect circle. It\\'s sweet but not. Deep but not. Heavy but light. And in a weird way, tasted like a chocolate covered orange. (Please don\\'t let that description read too specifically and turn you off. That\\'s just the only other flavor combination that made me feel similarly!)\\n\\nThe Twin Lion - rye, lemon, sugar, egg white, wine. Pretty drink with four visible layers. Frothy and foamy on top with the egg white, then silky, then the hit of wine. Very fun. \\n\\nCzarine - vodka, dry vermouth, apricot liquor, bitter. \"Mmm, tasty!\" - Marissa again. \\n\\nTo eat: \\n\\nThai Chili Wings. These were perfect. Right amount of crisp on the skin but soft from the meat. Served not too hot (as wing often are). And the thai chili flavor was sweet and tangy without being too thick or syrupy sweet, again how these wings usually are. \\nI think there were 10 wings. They come with a sauce that tastes sour creamy-y, and an onion-y slaw. I didn\\'t love either accoutrement alone, but the trio of chicken, sauce, and slaw was divine. \\n\\nShrimp Cocktail. Thick big shrimp (5) served on an asian-y carrot slaw. The cocktail sauce was BOMB. Thick, chunky, spicy, and red. Lol. Again, I really enjoyed the shrimp, sauce, and slaw all together. \\n\\nShort Rib Buns. Order comes with two. The short rib is good, if a little salty. Dish comes together nicely with a fresh mango slaw on top. (Lots of slaws here...ever write a word so much you start to question if it\\'s a real word and if you\\'re spelling it correctly? Yeah. Slaw.)  Just be careful with these because the paper they\\'re served in stuck to the buns, which aided in their disintegration. \\n\\nMusic was a loud but cool mix of 2000s alternative rock (I think) - just imagine lots of The Killers. \\n\\nTwo servers were working together, the aforementioned Pablo and a very nice girl named Caitlin. (\"Girl\" seems diminutive, but \"lady\" seems aging. Le sigh.) Caitlin was super excited about all the cocktails and did a great job of explaining them and aiding in our decisions. I hope to see her behind the bar soon! \\n\\nWhen we were done, I kindof elbowed my way up to the bar. Giuseppe looked up quickly and said, \"I\\'ll be right with you!\" \\n\"Oh that\\'s okay, I just wanted to say thank you.\" His face lit up, and I could see his pride and excitement pouring through with his ear to ear smile. \\n\\nFinally, super cool: the two lions on the logo are Patience and Fortitude, from the NYPL main branch. Apparently when Giuseppe was a kid during NYC\\'s dark days, he wasn\\'t allowed to go anywhere after school except the library.  Swoon. \\n\\nTL;DR - get here soon so you can say you went before it was famous. And yes I\\'ll go with you.', u'Sometimes it pays to have friends.  This place doesn\\'t pop up when you google \"best cocktails in nyc\".  Luckily one of my colleagues threw the recommendation my way and I am glad he did.\\n\\nThis place has a very creative cocktail list in addition to their stirrups on old timer classics.  I highly recommend the Strawberry Ramos. Don\\'t feel guilty ordering one because they use a blender instead of hand shaking it for 10 minutes.  The food here is a bit expensive but well worth it. the $17 tator tots were addictive but the real gems here are the thai chicken wings and their take on a bao bun.  Pricing.... reasonable for the quality.  Give or take $15 a drink. I would come back here any day of the week. The service was absolutely phenomenal.\\n\\nTheir music playlist was pretty awesome too. A mix of old school hip hop and some pop.  Sound system is pretty weak, but again... this place is more of a social scene and not a dance club.  8 drinks, two shots, three shared plates, 20 percent tip, just under $200.', u\"Amazing food (especially the chicken sandwich and the burgers) and incredible, friendly staff (ask for Gavi). And yet the whole thing is ruined by music that is cranked so loud you can't have a conversation with the person next to you.\\n\\nIf you're looking to pick up dinner to take home, this place is the best. If you're out with people you'd like to hear, maybe go next door to Subject.\", u\"A very worthy new entrant to the pantheon of great NYC cocktail bars, but that's unsurprising given the talent behind it (formerly Milk & Honey, Painkiller, Pegu Club etc.).\\n\\nHad only intended to visit once, but enjoyed it so much that I shunted other new bars off the list to return ... though it helps that we'd just had dinner at the impeccable Root & Bone around the corner.\\n\\nUnlike other reviews, I hadn't found the music levels to be problematic, though perhaps we lucked out as we went on quieter evenings - perhaps this is a Friday night phenomenon?\\n\\nStaff were consistently friendly and competent. We tried the chicken soup, which was superb. I believe it gets bought in from another local business, but kudos for outsourcing when the quality is this good. The wings a fellow drinker had next to us seemed to be excellent too.\\n\\nDrinks were brilliant across the board. Duke of Suffolk Martini is perhaps the most revelatory experience - effectively a reimagined Irish coffee, but with tea and gin. Perfectly crafted and balanced, as was every other drink we had (do ask for a Trinidad Sour too which is off-menu but created by the proprietor). I applaud their bravery in doing a whole 1/3 of the menu of expertly executed vodka cocktails ... as someone who runs a bar that's a bit snobbish about vodka, they've given me something to chew on.\\n\\nHighly recommended.\", u\"Good place to relax and enjoy stellar cocktails. Cozy and laid back which is a plus, But then again it's a lazy Sunday afternoon when I visited. Highly recommend\"], u'29.Curry! Modern Caribbean Experience': [u\"HIGHLY IMPRESSIVE! The jerk chicken was PHENOMENAL! Incredibly and surprisingly juicy as well as a good sized 1/2 portion. It seems like they brined it for at least a day to achieve such tenderness! BEST JERK SAUCE IVE EVER HAD! The sides seemed meager at first but it was exactly the right amount and packed with flavor! \\n\\nI'm basing my review on a pickup order. I had a craving for jerk chicken (which is not represented at all in park slope) but was hesitant to drop $21. It was worth every penny, as I'm in full recline, post gorge, still tasting the complex flavors! \\n\\nThe staff was friendly. The decor isn't terribly exciting and doesn't reflect the superb fare being served up. I wished they served lunch/brunch and didn't charge for delivery BUT it doesn't deter me from getting my jerk fix again!\", u\"Unfortunately,  not as impressed as I was hoping to be. Always excited to try newly open places but as someone mentioned - they really have a long way to go. \\nThe atmosphere is inviting and friendly, they do have a back yard for when this heat wave passes, and the staff are very friendly.  Although it would also help the cause if the restroom door closed (eye roll)\\nI really enjoyed the hibiscus drink and my friend's ginger beer was quite gingery (though different from what I expected). We were pleasantly surprised by the wings - very flavorful, well seasoned, and (mostly) moist. The rest of the food didn't make us as happy - crab cakes lacked flavor and weren't at all complimented by the mango salsa on them. Mac'n Cheese was alright though the burning sensation you get from the jerk seasoning as an aftertaste (we assumed that's what it was because it's not spicy at first bite) wasn't really doing much for us.  The same goes for the polenta that was the side dish to the pork chop, which was quite over cooked and not at all complimented by the sauce - it felt overwhelming at times because it was just so separate from the meat. The fish - eh s'ok ... we really wanted oxtail but they didn't have it and now I'm thinking may be that was a good thing?\", u'Definitely give this place a try. Delicious carribean food with a twist. P.S really good music!', u\"I was extremely excited to see a new Caribbean spot in the old Backyard! But sadly, I left really disappointed in this quaint, beautifully renovated, neighborhood eatery. Curry has a really long way to go in making itself a neighborhood hot spot. I'm sure once the liquor license is granted, that will certainly help the cause. However, the quality of food and service will have to improve, if this hot spot to be has any chance of keeping its doors open. The crab cakes were soggy and cold. The wings were the same. I was hungry so I ate it. But left the crab cakes. I couldn't give my opinion because I was never asked. To be honest, it was a no for me...Sorry. As a new restaurant, I do expect there to be some kinks that will need to be worked out. So, I look forward to returning in a few months to give the rest of the menu another go. Hopefully it was just an off moment in time.\", u'Best oxtail I have had in Park slope hands down. At first I was a little confused on the portion : price ratio. However I will gladly say it was well worth the wait and the price.', u'Wonderful authentic Caribbean food! There is no booze here (they just opened and license is pending- they will have it!!) so come for the food and have ya drinks somewhere else... for now. It is absolutely worth it. We started with the crab cakes and the corn esquites! Both was very good! The crab cakes came with a small salad with figs which was a surprise and a nice touch! We both had the Jerk Chicken. Needless to say there was nothing left at the end of the meal. Absolutely wonderful! The spice was all there and we were full!! Highly recommend and will come again.', u\"High quality food with delicious flavor! I got the jerk chicken. This is a dish I often think people don't get right. They nailed it! I cleaned my plate. Great service and friendly atmosphere.\", u'Our dinner was spectacular. I had the oxtail and it had unbelievable flavor. My husband got the pork chop and he loved it. Plantains were also awesome. Will definitely be back.', u\"The food is quite flavorful.  The corn chowder had great flavor and texture.  The wings were very tasty not too hot!  The portions were just right.  Can't wait til they get their liquor license.\", u'This new restaurant in Park Slope offers Jamaican cuisine that is both delicious and a unique flavor for the area. Offering a limited menu, they are clearly focusing on their strengths. Great atmosphere and service.', u\"This restaurant was a delightful surprise. We started with crab cakes. The order comes with 2 appetizer sized crab cakes and they were chock full of crab and delicious. There's a little portion of green salad with figs and the dressing is a little spicy and very good. My wife had the oxtail. It's not a dish I usually order but she's a fan and she said this was the best she's ever had, big and tender and meaty. I had the cod escovitch. The fish was perfectly cooked, moist and delicious.  So why did I give 4 stars instead of five (I would've given 4  1/2 stars but couldn't figure out how)? 2 reasons and they are minor. 1- They currently don't have a liquor license, but expect one soon. 2- My wife ordered coconut water and got a bottle of Zico (with a glass). Would have been nice to get fresh, or at least imported Caribbean coconut water. Outside of those minor quibbles we had a great meal here and will be back. Hopefully next time we'll have enough room after the meal for some of their homemade ice cream\", u'Ok....the crab cakes were delicious. But the oxtails were not to my liking. The ginger beer (water and ginger in a glass)was house made and awful. No jerk wings.Will not return.', u'Amazing food! A group of 5 of us split every entree from the menu + curry fries, wings (tamarind bbq), and crab cakes. The sorrel was great, perfectly subtle and refreshing. The backyard is beautiful and will have lunch there very soon. Also - GET the ice cream sampler.', u\"I've been to Curry twice now and been blown away by the food both times. The portions are very generous while the plates balance the perfectly spicy mains with hearty, savory sides. Very relaxing back yard with trees and soft lighting. Was so impressed with the pork chop and the oxtail, will definitely be back! Friendly staff was a plus.\", u\"We stumbled across Curry! while we were in the area for a play at BAX. Because it looked new, we wanted to give it a try. \\n\\nOur dinner: (1) Cesar salad, anchovies, croutons, and jerk chicken (2) Jerk Chicken, collared greens, plantains, and peas and rice. The food-- especially the 1/4 serving of chicken-- was delicious. The jerk wasn't an overly spicy jerk, but a beautiful aromatic one. The only downside is that their liquor license is pending-- so no rum or Red Stripe (yet!).\\n\\nOur experience: The server was terrific-- she balanced a group in the garden with our table and didn't miss a beat. She also was quick for her favorites and recommendations, including homemade ice creams.\\n\\nOverall it felt like a great family run restaurants Brooklyn has been and should forever be. We'd definitely go back.\", u\"My partner and I stumbled upon this new restaurant last night. Just the smells alone were convincing, but we were completely blown away by the food. Incredibly flavorful, complex, just brilliant, perfectly cooked. We'll definitely be adding this to our list of favorites in the neighborhood, and we can't wait to go back and try more dishes!\", u'AVOID. Saw they were offering oxtails at $20 a plate; I am always happy to pay top dollar for quality Carribean food and want to make sure my money is being spent local and ethically...when you\\'re paying top dollar to make sure your chicken is free range it\\'s also reasonable to ask if the rest of the supply chain is helping or hurting the local economy. Am I supporting Wal-Mart or my local bodega? Etc. So I asked the one woman working there if it was a black owned business. If it had been, I would have gone out of my way to support it despite the high prices. If not, I might take my $20 and go to Glady\\'s, which is closer to home, and, quite frankly, amazing. Etc. Big mistake. I believe she was the co-owner and she went off on me (I am also a small lady and I found her demeanor aggressive and threatening) snapping and getting in my face about how her business partner was black and how dare I ask and what difference did it make. Well, if you\\'re a white lady so uncomfortable with the very idea of supporting local black owned businesses that you rail at a customer with a genuine interest in spending their money in your (empty, on a Sunday evening on a busy stretch of 5th ave) restaurant maybe you should stick to selling something that doesn\\'t invite the type of questions that your overpriced pan-\"Carribean\" cooking does.', u\"We went to Curry! for Mother's Day and found it pretty empty. But it won't stay that way for long once word gets out about its delicious food. Yes, you can get jerk for $5 in Crown Heights. But this is jerk chicken to die for. And the vegetarian curry was so robust, flavorsome and large, served with some kind of seriously rich deep-fried bread, I had enough left over to eat for lunch the next day. Did I mention the scrumptious homemade ginger beer and sorrel (hibiscus drink)? Will definitely be back.\"], u'107.Miriam': [u\"Came recently for brunch.  Got shakshuka, Middle eastern breakfast plate with side of hummus and side of falafel.  \\n\\nAll the food was good.  Nothing was off.  The only thing is that it's very crowded for brunch on weekends so you may have to wait awhile.  \\n\\nService was polite and prompt though. \\n\\nGo early to beat the crowds.\", u'Cozy and nice \\nGood customer service \\nOne of the best falafel I had in NY\\nThe haloomi salad and the lamb shawarma were superb', u\"Very cool Mediterranean / Israeli  brunch spot. I loved it, the food and service was fantastic. The food does take time to come out, but take your time, enjoy a sangria or some strong coffee and chit chat with your friends before the food comes out. The shakshuka (eggs poached in a tomato sauce) is mad delicious and comes with a nice tasty harrissa (n. african hot pepper sauce), it goes really well with the fried dough (which you should also get), the hummus is banging. And the burekas (stuffed puff pastry thing), were also tasty as hell too. The green shakshuka is not as good as the red one, but it's still pretty good. \\n\\nGood stuff, but dont come here if you''re in a rush!\", u\"The Mediterranean style breakfasts were good but loaded with grease that was still turning our stomachs a half hour after we left. The shakshuka arrived with a decent hummus plate (drowning in oil) but there's a good energy to this location - just need to order healthier options than I chose and perhaps it will be more satisfying.\", u'Back again on a hot summer night. \\n\\nHave to start with white wine.\\n\\nTake note-  Risling from Germany is sweet!  \\n\\nInstead got a colombard which was nice but after the sweet wine my palate is probably off.\\n\\nSchiava rose wine-  first sip is good but not a glass\\n\\n\\nRoasted half eggplant with yogurt', u\"One of my go-to brunches in New York! Consistently delicious, great location, attentive staff and busy, very very busy. If you're looking to go on the weekend, I suggest heading over there as early as possible to account for the inevitable wait but I will assure you, it is very worth it and there are plenty of coffee shops in the area to wait at.\\n\\nThe Mediterranean Crispy Dough is a must. Absolutely delicious. Get some sides as well- bacon, fries, hummus, whatever you're into. There are tons of options and it is definitely worth making the trip too - I even do it from Manhattan!\", u'I\\'ve eaten here for brunch, happy hour, and dinner and food and service were always great. I took my little cousin here for her first \"real\" Mediterranean food experience and it was the perfect choice. I do agree that the food is heavy (oily) and its hard to find something healthy.', u'Underwhelmed. Food took forever. We got the French toast and an egg dish. Nothing came out hot. Some dried up something was on the French toast. The fruit was sour, the spreads were average...very disappointed. (Even the tap water not to Brooklyn standard yikes).', u\"Not sure any brunch game in NYC actually deserves such long lines, but you also don't find burekas as an entree at any brunch spot. I thought they were delicious and even more so with the incredible tahini sauce.\", u\"Miriam had a nice date night vibe! Prices were good for the portion size. We got the special for the night which was cod... it was very good but I preferred our other dish (the shrimp couscous). It was big and full of veggies so it felt healthy! Couscous comes on the side so you can mix in to your liking. Comes with a spicy greenish sauce. We got the Burekas as a starter! It was delicious--a small pastry type of appetizer with cheese . The drinks were the highlight I think . Get the Lil Cuke! It's so refreshing and light! Tastes like a cucumber juice drink! Loved it.\", u'I had brunch here  with some friends a while back and have been meaning to yelp about it. \\nIncredible Burekas and Shakshuka. The labneh was fresh and light, the eggs were high quality and golden yolked. The coffee was good and strong. Beautiful, fresh Israeli/ Med food in a perfect brunch setting... lots of windows and light, busy but not too busy. Dishes clanking and great staff doing their jobs well. It was probably just out of necessity but it was a nice touch to see the staff walking through with high quality ingredients they were buying right from the street markets. One more thing... nice fresh juice and good tabletop.', u'For a mid-afternoon lunch I had the couscous with squash, zucchini, raisins, and other veggies with a side of spinach. Absolutely delightful! Service was perfect. And for that time of day they were busy but had readily available seating.\\nI will return!', u\"I've been to Miriam for lunch several times and it never disappoints. I stumbled upon it in the neighborhood one day and recommend it to anyone visiting Park Slope!\", u\"3.5 Stars to be exact.\\n\\nWe stopped by Miriam this Sunday morning before returning to my Brooklyn home. This place was jammed packed even upon opening. I would anticipate much waiting at each phase which is probably the only downside of this place. This is a decent spot for Israeli brunch. For our brunch today, I got the Burekas plate while my companion got the Norwegian Eggs. La Colombe coffee is served here and it comes with complimentary refills!\\n\\nBurekas plate was 'eggcellent'! It comes with two burekas (an olive stuffed flaky pastry topped with seasame seeds), Israeli salad, lebanese cheese, green sauce, and two eggs any style which I opt for herb scrambled eggs. Herb scrambled eggs were basically scrambled eggs with scallion, cilantro, and parsley - simple yet so good even without condiments! This was a simply delicious plate for those who wants something light. I really enjoyed it! \\n\\nNorwegian Eggs. I will start off by saying, skip this, it is soggy. Poached eggs were extremely raw that the yolk is room temperature while the smoked salmon was cooked on top of the hot but soggy english muffin. On the other hand, side salad and potatoes that it comes with was really good.\\n\\nService was okay since it was super busy. Our waitress took our orders and refilled our coffee cups when we needed her to. Overall, a decent experience and probably would revisit only if I am in the area.\", u\"Miriam I will be back for you..! If your looking for a cute brunch spot with a little more eclectic menu offering, make this your choice. The Burekas were some of the best pastries I have ever eaten. Plus the Mediterranean salad and eggs, so the portions are pretty generous. Everyone's meals around me looked equally as delicious that it made it difficult to select the one thing to order.\\nOn a Saturday at 1:30, there was a 30 min wait for 2 people, but it ended up being only 15 min. Worth the wait!\", u\"Sooooooooo good. Why did it take me so long to check this place out!? \\n\\nCame here for brunch today with a group and we literally ordered one of everything. It was all so delicious!\\n\\nWe ordered:\\nFried dough (avoid)\\nShashuksa (flavorful)\\nNorwegian Eggs (best thing we ordered)\\nLebanese pasties (meh)\\nAnd...omg...and...a side of French toast to taste, followed by a whole order to share. Oh my French toast God! Make sure you order this, everyone order the same thing and don't share!\\n\\nThe ambiance of this place is really cool and looks very Lebanese with lanterns and carved wood everywhere. It doesn't look like a sultans den though so it's very tasteful. \\n\\nI can't wait to come back for dinner.\", u'Came for Brunch on a Saturday morning at noon. Waited a quick 5 mins for a table and received a phone call from the pleasant host when our table was ready. \\n\\nHad the Burekas & Herbed Eggs w Home Fries. Very Good. \\n\\nFriendly & Attentive staff! Def Recommend.', u\"I came for brunch on a Monday morning on my day off and it was absolutely delightful! The restaurant is super cute and I love the decorations, and from the moment I walked in I knew I was going to love Miriam! My waitress let me pick where I wanted to sit and promptly brought over some water and a menu. The brunch menu is great - $15 for an entre and there is quite the selection to chose from! I finally decided on the burekas with two poached eggs (your choice on how they're prepared) and I was beyond content with my choice! It was served with a side of labneh cheese, Israeli salad & tahini sauce. It was all delicious! I also had a cup of coffee and their coffee was so flavorful and enjoyable. I had a fantastic brunch at Miriam and I will definitely be back to try other brunch options as well as dinner options!\", u\"Amazing food, bottomless coffee, hummus that rocks your world!!!!  The waiters are really nice and the food comes out fast. \\n\\nMy only gripe is that as an Israeli, I do not feel that the pita does this place justice. It seems like the kind you can buy bagged in a store. I miss the soft and warm pita I would buy in the holy land, it would be awesome if they could start doing this. The pita Miriam serves tends to be a little dry, hard and uneasy to make your own sandwich with. \\n\\nThat being said, I'll still be coming back regardless :)\", u\"This brunch spot is hands down one of the best places to go to. Our wait time on a Sunday was 5-10 minutes which is fantastic considering busy hours! \\nWe got shakshuka (a must!!!), burekas (yummy stuff), cappuccino, mochaccino and side of crispy bacon (we love bacon). \\nShakshuka came with hummus and pita bread (amazing and fresh!), and perfectly poached eggs. I also asked for some hot salsa/sauce and they delivered beyond my expectations! I have no idea what that was but some kind of salsa-like side made from peppers, garlic and spices (ask for it if you love spicy food, you won't regret it!). Our drinks were good, and food came rather quickly from the kitchen! \\n\\nWe will be back sooner than later!\"], u'127.George\\u2019s': [u\"I have lived in the Ditmas Park neighborhood for about 20 years and I remember the old George's. It was taken over about a year-and-a-half ago and I have to say it was a move to better ways... much better food!\\n\\nThe staff is super friendly... the food is delicious. The only drawback is that it's not a big place and they probably only have about 15 tables if that. Meaning if you come here for breakfast on the weekends half the time you have to wait. Menu cheap and affordable... well by the standards of this neighborhood now.. this is one of my go-to places especially if I want breakfast. They serve a killer eggs benedict! I always ask for it with regular bacon yummy. They have really good wraps and delicious pancakes..\\n\\nThis does not detract in any way from my review that I will say that I feel like there's too many people working there.. they are always Milling around in the second you finish something they ask you if they can take it which of course is not always a bad thing... just makes me feel a little bad on the weekends if there's people waiting for my table when they're staring waiting for me to finish all of that could be just me!!\\n\\nStill five stars nevertheless!!\", u\"I love George's! I live in the hood and come here often. It is good, solid dinner fare. I recommend the Mexican omelet for breakfast. \\n\\nThe reason I'm inspired to write this is they just got a new Credit Card machine that allows you to email the receipt! I love that we don't have to waste paper that way.\", u'Great place for lunch. The tough part is finding parking but there are metered spots usually available.\\n\\nI ordered the greek salad with grilled chicken special. I also had the new england clam chowder to start.  \\n\\nThe chowder was good diner type soup. It had a creamy texture with some nice chunks of clam. \\n\\nThe greek salad was massive and everything was fresh and well prepared. Chicken was grilled perfectly where it was still juicy. \\n\\nService was on point as well. The place is not huge but it makes for a cozy atmosphere. I will be back. \\n\\nAlso tried the yogurt with granola and fruit. Very healthy and delicious option. Price is a little high for a yogurt with fruit but it was very good. The granola came in these little nuggets which was different but overall good.', u\"Better than I thought it would be!  I'm just visiting the area and happened upon this diner.  The service is very nice and the food is much better than I hoped.  I ordered a fried fish sandwich and the fish is excellent and a very good helping.  The lettuce is very green and the tomato very ripe and red...not typical.\", u\"Followed recommendation of freinds and yelpers,  not sure why it's consider a good place, \\n  I got a burger  deluxe, one of the first Burgers I have ever hade!\\n The bone wasn't  as fresh, the Burger hade no test.\\nthe service  was k. \\nI personally  probably  won't be back\", u\"A classic neighborhood diner - the food is good and comes out quickly, service is great and there is plenty of paid parking available. \\n\\nCame in with a group of six, and we were seated pretty quickly. I had the corned beef hash (which was delicious), and that was enough for me even though it was just a side. Pancakes and French toast were fluffy, and the rest of the food is portioned and priced well.  \\n\\nThis place isn't the closest diner to me, but it might just become my go-to!\", u'Came for brunch with my bf around 1215pm on a Saturday and it was quite busy. Luckily only waited about 5 minutes for a table to open up. \\n\\nCalifornia benedict- poached eggs, tomatoes and avocado on English muffin with hollandaise sauce and comes with a plate of home fries. It was quite delicious. The hollandaise sauce was good and not too heavy. The poached egg was cooked nicely and the yolk bled beautifully. Home fries was good too.\\n\\nNutella stuffed french toast- not as \"stuffed\" as I thought as the nutella was mostly smeared on top of 2 pieces of skinny toast. For this reason, I was somewhat disappointed, but it still tasted good. Come on, Nutella on anything tastes good regardless of where it is on the plate. \\n\\nSide of bacon and sausage-they were ok. Nothing special.\\n\\nOverall, I had a decent brunch here.', u\"Nostalgia at its finest. With the latest trend of Diner closings, George's restaurant successfully satisfied our love for old school diner feels (and food).\\n\\nFood is delicious, service is top notch, friendly and inviting. Even the relationships between the staff within the establishment was warm and inviting.  Every person that walked in for a takeout left with a smile in their face. The waitress is super friendly and genuinely sweet. \\n\\nHome fries were delicious seasoned well and fresh. Omeletes are beautifully done. Orange juice are served in normal size not the little pint sizes that I absolutely hate. \\n\\nThis has been the most accommodating, clean, fast and pleasant experience on this side of Brooklyn!\", u'I pretty much love diners and this one is no exception. Good corned beef hash with perfect over-easy eggs and strong coffee. Prices are affordable and whenever I get delivery from them, the delivery person is super friendly and lightning fast. Definitely a neighborhood gem.', u'Fast service. Went for a late breakfast with my son and wife. Waitress was nice. She saw that our was hungry and asked the kitchen to make the silver dollar pancakes first. Clean simple menu. Clean cozy place. Lots of street parking. Will definitely be back.', u\"Clean place, prompt service, friendly and patient wait staff. Food is comfort food nothing divine like but good. Constant water refill that is much appreciated, plus coffee refill! Nice size space and they're pretty cool about pushing tables together to accommodate bigger groups. Willing to make changes to the menu according to your need.\\nGood eating spot\", u\"A few years ago I walked into George's and my experience was not that great. The restaurant was mistreated and the food was just awful and I told myself I would never come back. But just 2 weeks ago I saw George's on TV and under a new owner so I had to go see what all the fuss was about. \\n    Walking into George's last night was shocking, I couldn't believe this was the same restaurant I came in a few years back. Everything is well maintained. Floors are clean and everything is new. And the owner was really nice to us and the Service is great. And I must say the Food was Delicious. I would definitely be going back soon\", u\"Wow. I'm so glad I waited until seeing more reviews about George's to see everything so on point.\\n\\nI'm not very into diner style food but this, this is what all diners should be like. \\n\\nWe walked in and were greeted by a friendly gentleman who managed to seat us right away even though the place was packed. Water and menus were brought right away. \\n\\nWe ordered 3 different style egg dishes and gosh those portions are huge. And so so good. Tasty, hearty and the perfect breakfast delight. The service topped all. Our waitress was friendly and the food came to our tables stat. Free refills on coffee. \\n\\nThe food is very well priced for the portion sizes. \\n\\nParking was perfect on this rainy Saturday. We managed to park right out front. \\n\\nI think George's has now become my favourite weekend spot. It's exactly what this neighborhood needs.\", u\"The place is very clean and very nice people cool prices and food made to your liking. Place is clean not loud but little quite that u can bring a friend or a love one to dine.their one point when it comes to great customer service they don't want no guest to leave unhappy. The waiters that helped me was Stoto and George two young looking good spirited people. And the staff in the kitchen made my food so fast it was like I pour my soda in my cup and by the time I looked up guess what food was done. This place has top excellent customer services and great food.\", u'My brother who lives in Brooklyn brought me here this morning for breakfast. Very nice local spot for breakfast. The staff were all friendly, the menu offered plenty of choices and the prices are quite reasonable. My order was pretty simple, oatmeal, plain bagel and cream cheese and all was very good.', u'Great food, great service, decent price point. Ordered eggs benedict, pancakes, their special breakfast wrap. Everything is well done and tasted great except for the pancakes. Pancakes were about average. The wrap was phenomenal in the sense that it actually tasted like a meal instead of a wannabe salad in light carbs. Great place for all meals as they have a full menu not just for breakfast.\\n\\nThink about your average diner, and add quality care/ingredients and you got this place. Have been looking a long time for this type of place; well done traditional american diner food. It is slightly more expensive but the food and comfort is well worth it. \\n\\nIf you are sick of yuppie/hipster brunch, come here and you will not be disappointed.', u'Love the food and atmosphere here, very cozy and mt son love witch is the most important', u'This is a very good restaurant. The food here is delicous, I love Italian food. This place make it really authentic. Servers are very friendly . I crave for their food time to time. Definitely recommend.', u'Wonderful place. Very nice servers, they will accommodate for any needs, such as food allergies. Food was amazing.', u\"Not unexpectedly (because I have been here before but never gotten around to writing the review), we had a great breakfast at George's this morning. I had a Belgium waffle and my friend had eggs, home fries and a bagel. The bagel did not match those at some other area bagel places but everything else was spot on and when my friend wanted her poached egg cooked more, they immediately replaced it with one that was!\\n\\nThe restaurant is clean, the service fast and friendly and the coffee next stops flowing...what more could you ask for on a Sunday morning!\"], u'126.Korzo': [u\"Don't come here.\\n\\nNo, do not come here...because this is possibly my favorite restaurant in all of Mid/South Brooklyn. \\n\\nIf you're sick of ordering Eggs Benedict and Blueberry Pancakes for brunch like I was then this is absolutely the place to go. Their brunch menu is freaking enormous. They have $4 bloody mary's...if that's your thing. Their food is interesting and delicious. They offer 3 house-made condiments that are way better than generic Heinz (and I love Heinz!) You can go sweet or savory in the morning and their nighttime lineup has an array of burgers, goulash, grilled meats, vegetable heavy dishes.\\n\\nYou might spend an extra few dollars on the grub but it is so worth it b/c their food is effing good. If you're sick of dainty avocado toast and fresh strawberry compote from Milo's Rhinebeck farm and want to eat something unique like red pepper spatzele & a sausage pancakes then this is spot.\", u\"My friend and I decided dropped by here for dinner on a Thursday night - and I was thoroughly impressed.  \\n\\nService, food, and ambience was all so great and I had a great experience.\\nWe started with the mushroom soup, and had the steamed PEI mussels as our appetizers.  The mussels were super tiny (reason why I took off a star) however, the flavors for both the soup and mussels were impressive.  I'd probably skip the mussels next time and try something else, because the size of those mussels were smaller than my thumb.\\n\\nI got the Original Burger, and my friend got the Chef's burger.  All burgers come with fries and/or salad - but FRIES ALL DAY.  Burgers were juicy, well seasoned, and so good.  They have great crispy fries - I could eat them all day.\", u'Can food writers have groupies? Because back when Robert Sietsema was regaling Village Voice readers with his intrepid eating adventures, I was half-tempted to indulge in the food geek\\'s equivalent of tossing my panties onto the stage. (And please, no comments from the peanut gallery suggesting edible panties).  Anyway, I remember Sietsema\\'s raves about Korzo\\'s Fried Burger.  This Burger, along with a Bosnian Burger \"the size of a hubcap\" in Queens, went into my mental vault to try one day.  Well, I finally got to check one of these off my list:\\n\\nFirst the good:  Really liked the energy of this place on a Saturday night; it wasn\\'t insanely crowded, yet definitely happening.  Also LOVED the Beet & Ginger Martini!!!  Okay, so it could\\'ve used more ginger, but I could really taste the earthy flavor of beets and it was well-balanced.  Plus, if memory serves, it was only $9, which is a veritable bargain by NYC standards.  \\n\\nNow for that Burger.  Enjoyed the pocket-like \"bun\" that encased it; it almost tasted like a savory yeast doughnut which makes sense since both are deep fried.  Also was impressed it was cooked to an exact medium, as requested.   But beyond that, ITA with Mark T. in that the beef was woefully under-seasoned, and while moist, it wasn\\'t juicy.  Fries were great, especially dipped in the accompanying beet ketchup.\\n\\nAlso tried the Beet Burger and it was just a whole lotta magenta mush, sadly.  It had nothing on Schmorgasburg pop-up, Chickpea & Olive\\'s \\'you\\'ll never miss the meat\\' beauties.\\n\\nUltimately, this is a Burger with lots of potential, plus I really liked the whole laid back vibe of this spot, so I\\'d return and give it another try.  And don\\'t worry.  I still love you, Robert.  Can I call you Robert?', u\"Korzo's menu definitely looked interesting when I was taking a look at it. We were seated fairly quickly when entering, however to get our food after ordering took 45 minutes to an hour. We ordered the original Korzo burger and the Wunderwurst. Both dishes were extremely salty. The pickled vegetables were a nice touch though. However because of the extremely long wait, it ended up being somewhat unpleasant for me as I was starving.\", u\"I'd been wanting to try Korzo years and years ago at their original location in SI. Was so excited to try it here in Bk. It did not disappoint. I'm sure it exists, but I don't know of any other place (other than the Korzo restaurants) with a burger, stuffed inside a pastry. We had the chef's and the beet burgers on our visit and both were outstanding. The beef was very flavorful and juicy. I ordered the beet, because it was calling my name even though I went in wanting meat. So glad I did, it was hearty, the cheese added the perfect creaminess. Fresh cut fries on the side, mmm it was heaven. It was an early lunch on a weekday, so we actually had the rear dining room to ourselves. The beet-ini was also delish. Cute decor, probably a good date spot but also looked good for large groups in the rear dining area. Brunch looks interesting so will have to try that some time.\", u\"Customer service :5/5\\nQuality of drink:5/5\\nPrice: $25-40 /per\\n\\nI saw some TV show about them. This place was so packed and waited for 45min to seat. This restaurant is very small too. Food was good I loved deep fried burger and I'm so glad I could try them!\", u'I love the Bay Ridge location and have been here twice. I most recently came on a Saturday night around 8:30 and easily found Ar seating for my boyfriend and I. \\nBeetini still delicious but only one server . She seemed harried and it was a little frustrating, on a Saturday night I am sure she would have appreciated help,she seemed friendly but stressed.\\n\\nGet the fried burger! I barely eat meat, but when I do this one never lets me down.', u\"Best burger I have had in a long time! First of all it's a deep fried burger, can't get better then combining the best of a cheeseburger and fried dough. I ordered the chef (a little pricey) but well worth it. The meat was so tender and juicy that it made my crunchy buns soggy which sounds worse then it actually was. I don't remember what was in it but it tasted so darn perfect along with the house made hot sauce and beer ketchup. My girlfriend ordered the Slav which was also delicious but I liked the chef more. \\n\\nWhen you come to eat at Korzo, you have to try the beet ketchup and the housemate hot sauce. The hot sauce in my opinion was better and it was so good I tried to buy a bottle. Sad to say they had no more left. I can't wait to come back for another burger and more of that hot sauce.\", u\"Looking for delicious fried burger- don't know where to go? Come here! Definitely a must try if you're around the area. \\nAlthough it's about $16 per burger + fries, it won't leave you disappointed. The burger here is one of the best I've tasted. I think we could've had more fries though. \\n\\nI had the Slav and my boyfriend ordered the chef. Get either or!!! I loved taking the first bite and having it exceed all my expectations. The chef was perfectly done and he really enjoyed it . \\n\\nI would probably come here again for sure. I'm not a big burger fan but this burger really was amazing!!\", u'I heard \"deep fried burgers\" and I had to try it out. However, it was not as good as it sounds.\\n\\nGot the original and Slav fried burger. We had asked for medium rare & medium well, respectively, but both came out medium to medium-rare and was dry.\\n\\nOriginal - a good choice for first timers, nothing unfamiliar to the typical American palate\\n\\nSlav - I wanted to try something different and this seemed to fit the bill. Juniper berries, caraway seeds, and Bryndza cheese were new to me. Did not care for the juniper berries, indifferent about the caraway seeds, and not enough Bryndza. :( Overall it was average.\\n\\nThe fries that came as a side were fried perfectly, light and crispy.\\n\\nIt was kind of chilly in here. Felt like there was no heat.\\n\\nOverall, the food here provided a new experience. I have no regrets that I tried this place out, but I have no interest in returning.', u\"Visited korzo to try their internet famous fried burger. The burger appeared huge in pictures so me and my friend decided to split 1. We opted for the original. It was not huge and we definitely could've had 1 each. I didn't see the hype on this burger. It was just plain ol' good. If I were to visit again I would try their Otto fried burger and some other things I saw on their menu. On the other hand our server was awesome and wound up giving us an extra side order of fries on the house :)\", u'This is my favorite local restaurant.  The food is consistently great and the staff are always wonderful. Whether you are a local or a visitor they will treat you well! I love the trout and fried chicken!', u'Amazing...the beet centric options were spot on! The cocktails are very well done. The price is reasonable...so go and enjoy!', u\"For eastern European food, I am used to heading to Greenpoint, where you can get a really good meal for less than $10. \\n\\nI was not so sure how I would feel about eating a $17 burger all the way out in south slope (since I come from bedstuy). However, this was a really good burger to eat and the portion was very generous. \\n\\nThe people that work here are very nice. It's great to find a place where you can have real conversations with real people. \\n\\nI would love to come back here again and try more food. \\n\\n\\nJust had the best pickleback of my life!! Best fried burger in NYC!\", u\"Been feening to come try the fried burgers since many months ago, but never got the chance to come until today. I came with 2 other people on an early Monday afternoon, and the place is not busy at this time. \\nThey seated us in a table in the back room and it's really dim in here. \\n\\nOverall, the fried burgers are delicious. Other foods we tried were just alright.\\nWe ordered several plates to share. The chefs burger, the otto burger, plate of sausages from the Octoberfest platter, and the halusky.\\nHalusky appetizer was raved by so many yelpers, but I thought it was just alright. I was kinda disappointed. It's similar to Mac and cheese, but somewhat sour. The bacon bits on top were good, but not good enough to make me like the dish.\\nThe chefs burger tasted like a greasy heavy manly American burger, but with the fried dough rather than buns. The beef was cooked just right at medium rare and it was so juicy. The fried dough was pretty good. \\n\\nThe otto burger was also DELICIOUS. It has the garlic aioli sauce which complimented the juicy beef nicely. My whole party preferred this burger over the Chef's burger. (Chef's burger was also good, but this tasted better). The fries that came with the burgers were good.\\n\\nThe sausage platter was ok. Nothing special. Really heavy/greasy. I don't normally drink alcohol but I was really tempted to order a cup of beer to help me wash down the greasy sausages. However, I didn't want to order beer (I don't like alcohol), so the horseradish and onions worked fine in neutralizing the greasiness. \\n\\nOverall, the fried burgers were delicious and interesting to try once.\", u'WOW!  That was the best burger I have ever had.   SO juicy and full of flavor.  I ordered the chef burger.  It was so worth it.  I  had house salad instead of fries and it was really good. I loved the pickled vegetables.  The \"Beet Ketchup\" is a signature item and is really good\\nThey also make a great hot sauce.  If you are every close to this place you don\\'t want to miss out.  WOW!', u'So glad we finally made it to Korzo. On a rainy Spring day, not wanting to travel far into the wilds or Brooklyn, or worse yet, into Manhattan (shudder), we searched through our local options and came upon Korzo. Bookmarked ages ago, today was the day.\\n\\nAnd sure enough, Korzo delivered. A fried burger...is it overly-indulgent? Will I feel like I should be on one of those \"Heart Attack Grill\" style food network shows? Not at all. In fact, I found the very light shell of dough coating the burger to be far less of a gut buster than the standard giant style, butter soaked brioche bun. I opted for the Slav burger, and it was totally delicious. Good fries and a fantastic schnitzel, more than plentiful for two hungry kids to share. Served with a size of bacon braised kale, our Park Slope dreams came to full fruition.\\n\\nA nice surprise about Korzo is that they have the opposite pricing strategy to most brunch places: the food isn\\'t cheap, but the drinks most certainly are. Nicely stocked bar, a dozen or more beers on draft, super cheap brunchy cocktails...win, win for all.\\n\\nGreat rainy day food, great sunny day brunch. Definitely hit up Korzo when in South Slope.', u'I saw this place on the food network channel and was obsessed with trying their famous deep fried burgers. This place was awesome and the staff was great too. The food was good and would go back again!!! Would definitely recommend this place!', u'I\\'m sorry Korzo, while I have no regrets trying your food, for me at least you did not live up the hype.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, if you are a fan of burgers and of fried food, you should definitely check this place out.  How can you go wrong with a deep fried burger... well in my case you can go wrong with the meat.\\n\\nIf the meat was on par, then the burger would be what a fellow Yelper called \"a burgasm\". Everything was so fresh and hot, it needed time to cool.\\n\\nNo matter how good a piece of meat you have, even if it is the most expensive part of the animal, will need some kind of seasoning 97.5% of the time. The 2.5% applies to bacon.\\n\\nBoth in biting into the burger and in trying the meat by itself with a fork and knife, I found that it was extremely lacking in seasoning of any kind. Because it was cooked medium-rare, biting into the burger, the texture blended with everything else, and the flavor just wasn\\'t there. It also was moist, but not juicy, which is a double edged sword in this case. Doesn\\'t leak and make everything soggy, but doesn\\'t add flavor.\\n\\nSpeaking of biting, it wasn\\'t too oily (a little on the inside), but I did expect a little more crispness to the bread.\\n\\nAs for the everything else, they were in fact amazing. There was a combination of a little sweet, salty spicy and savory. All of these flavors worked together amazingly well, if the meat had a taste, it would be even better.\\n\\nBacon could have been a touch thicker, and while the cheese wasn\\'t perfectly melty (this type of cheese doesn\\'t melt as easily), it was flavorful, and in perfect amount. \\n\\nThe fries you can get with the burger are not, in fact, steak fries as the menu claims, but rather are more like shoestring fries. They were seasoned appropriately, and came hot out of the fryer, not from under a lamp.\\n\\nSalad was much less exciting, it was lettuce and beets. The beets were for my taste a little big for the salad. If it was dressed, then extremely lightly.\\n\\nIf you want fries and salad, the cost is $4 extra (don\\'t quote me on this) just get the fries. Trust me on this.\\n\\nHad Korzo Ale. A delightful brew, not too heavy, but not dish water either. Had a delightful bite at the end. Goes great with the burger.\\n\\nFor dessert had Suhajdi. While they were generally good, I have a couple. First, it would be nice if the leafy part was cut off of the strawberries, especially since you are given a spoon to eat with. Second, while the chocolate was good, and did seem house-made, as there were some nuts inside, it didn\\'t seem like truffle, just like good semisweet chocolate.\\n\\nService was nice, but could have been a touch more attentive.', u\"Saw these deep fried burgers on YouTube and had to come try it.  Came in on a Thursday afternoon, no wait.  Didn't bother to try anything else on the menu, because the names were weird, there are no photos of the food for newbies, and each burger entree was already $17.  I had the Original and the girlfriend had the Otto.  Took about 30 minutes for the food to arrive, but it was all worth the wait.  This is probably my new favorite burger.  Better than a BK Bacon Quad Stack.\\n\\nI feel like coming back over and over again until I've tried all the burgers!\"], u'129.Purbird': [u\"Purbird is like that friend you take for granted - always reliable, unassuming, friendly, down to earth, but such a good listener that you can forget they're around because they're not flashy. Purbird serves amazing roast chicken, solid sides, sandwiches, and salads in this cozy unremarkable space. It's super casual, with seats for maybe 15, 20 if you include the seating outside. You order at the counter and the team will deliver fresh plates of food to you. Prices are affordable and food is quality. Everything is made fresh, so expect to hang around for at least 10-15 minutes minutes, even for takeout.\\n\\nI always go for the plate with a half chicken, a potato, a vegetable, and the bread. The chickens are on the small side, but I usually split a half chicken plate with someone so I can get a third side. I love their jalapeno mac and cheese, the jalapeno mashed potatoes, the toasted bread with olive oil, cream spinach, mashed sweet potato (writing this list is making me hungry...) They also have an amazing chicken burger, so good it will surprise you. Getting plain grilled chicken over salad is also reliably tasty. (Vegetarians basically only get salad and sides here, but I promise you they are good.) \\n\\nBathroom is narrow but clean. There are a few steps down into the restaurant, so not wheelchair friendly, but okay with a stroller if you have help. No changing table.\", u'Simple a very and friendly place thats for sure. \\nI read the menu before coming so i already knew what i kind of wanted. \\nI got the mac n cheese w/ crispy lemon dill vinaigrette   romaine salad. \\nThe mac n cheese was freaking hot ooey gooey goodness of cheese craft. My taste buds went to HAPPYLAND. Anyways i dine in by the window w my mentor so it was perfect for the projects we were coming up w.\\nDid i mention i got me a Stella on tap  \\nIm coming back my dear', u'Grilled chicken is great, juicy and full of flavors. We worried that the whole chicken would be too much but it was actually fine between two girls. \\n\\nThe mac and cheese was disappointing though, the mac was overcooked and felt soggy.\\n\\nOverall I would do take out in the future, just the chicken tho.', u\"Purbird is my go to place when I'm looking for good ole' fashioned comfort food.\\n\\nEverything on the menu is good. All their chicken is to die for, whether it's their chicken burger, chicken pie, or whole chicken....but for me, what I always come back craving are the sides. Their jalapeno mac&cheese and sauteed spinach are my usual go-tos, but their vegetable of the day is usually a winner as well. Purbird also has one of the best chicken soups I've ever had - if you're ever feeling under the weather or need something to warm you up, I guarantee this soup will not let you down. \\n\\nThe place has a counter service set up. Order at the counter and they bring the food out. Bus your own tables. FYI if you're just drinking tap water, you can grab a bottle or carafe from the fridge and they have cups on the shelf right across from the registers.\\n\\nIf I have to list a small handful of go-to places in the neighborhood for me, this would be one of them! Hope they never leave!\", u'My boyfriend and I came by on a Saturday night and good thing it wasn\\'t too busy.  I am not used to the \"self-service\" style here so minus one star for that.  You order food from the counter then basically seat yourself anywhere, grab your own water (they give you a cup) and own utensils.  We ordered the following:\\n\\nHalf Chicken ($9.50): flamed grilled chicken in original, includes purbird bread and purbird sauce.  We got an extra mango chutney sauce for $1.00.  The chicken, I must admit, was one of the moistest chicken I ever had!  The whole chicken was super flavorful.  The purbird sauce tasted very unique and great combo with the chicken.  The mango chutney was good too but boyfriend thought it was too sweet.\\n\\nSweet Potato Fries ($5.50): your average sweet potato fries... I would totally recommend this!  I like how the fries here don\\'t go soggy quick.\\n\\nJalapeno Mac-n-Cheese ($7.75): this came in a weirdly \"home-y\" feels kind of bowl lol.. presentation would be a thumbs down for this but taste wise it\\'s definitely there!  I\\'m not a person who can eat spicy and I didn\\'t taste too much jalapeno in this so I really enjoyed it.\\n\\nOverall, a very solid restaurant in the Park Slope area.  I would definitely come back.', u\"No lie P\\u016brbird may be the best grilled chicken I've ever had. If you've been to Nnandos in DC or London think that but better quality birds. \\n\\nCame here on a rainy afternoon and it had me feeling like it was 80 degrees and sunny. I got the grilled half chicken and it was drippin flavor. They have a bunch of different sauces that are really good. I didnt think the spicy half chicken needed it b/c it already has a sauce. When i had it with the sauce it actually had too much flavor. Honestly ive never uttered the words too much flavor until purbird. \\n\\nMy extra picky 12yr old mentee had the chicken burger and fries. Its speaks volumes that he did not leave one crumb. \\n\\nPurbird does one thing (grill chicken) and it does it better than anyone else in NYC.\", u\"Food: 4/5\\nAmbiance: n/a\\nService: n/a\\nValue: 5/5\\n\\nCame here with a few friends after going bouldering, as we'd heard really great things about the chicken here. The two of them got the lunch special (chicken + veggie of the day + potato side) while I got the chicken sandwich. It was certainly a lot of food, for a great price! What Purbird does very well is cook the chicken in a wonderfully moist way. I only give it a 4 on food because what surrounds the chicken (be it the veggies on the plate or the bread / other substances in the sandwich) are nothing special.\\n\\nHow likely would I be to recommend to a family/friend? 8 :)\", u\"The food here is a refined version of southern comfort food. We ordered the staples: grilled half chicken, spinach, mashed potatoes, and mac n cheese. \\n\\nChicken - tasted like a mix of rotisserie and grill, the meat was tender and juicy, with a hint of salt and char. We had the purbird dipping sauce which was sweet and spicy, and complimented the chicken well.\\n\\nMac n cheese - exactly what you asked for and expect, full of cheesy goodness\\n\\nMashed potatoes - creamy and satisfying\\n\\nThe reason that this place doesn't get 5 stars for me is because 1) the food is good, but it doesn't stand out. I was satisfied, but not blown away 2) we each spent 20 bucks on our meals, and that's a little much for chicken\", u\"Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to P\\u016brbird of course! Saturday night my girlfriend and I ventured here for a little pre-hockey dinner and boy were we clucking by the end of it.\\n\\nA tiny spot that's not too far from the Barclays Center/Atlantic Terminal. It was bustling with take out orders and delivery for those lucky enough to live locally. A handful of wood-glazed tables and some counter seating makes up the innards. A chalk-written menu filled with poultry options for your palate is your way to order.\\n\\nTo start, my girlfriend and I split the chicken burger and chicken breast sandwich. The burger's patty was a wonderfully ground combo of light and dark meat topped with lettuce, tomato, grilled onion and special sauce on a brioche bun creating a juicy and fresh mouthful in each bite. The sandwich had similar toppings but went in a different route with mashed avocado and turkey bacon (two birds on one sandwich!). The breast was well-seasoned with a nice charred flavor and a good balance of all ingredients. \\n\\nWe also split a couple of sides. First the mac-n-cheese which had a crispy layer of cheese atop it and oh so creamy underneath. But the real unique and amazing side was the jalape\\xf1o mashed potatoes. Soft and fluffy mash with jalape\\xf1o pur\\xe9e placed on top. It packed a helluva spicy punch (my girlfriend couldn't handle it), but the flavors were incredible. \\n\\nWe washed everything down with P\\u016brbird's own original iced tea. Super tasty with pomegranate juice, lime, and a hint of refreshing mint to top it off. It was a delightful way to wash down the chicken goodness we consumed.\\n\\nOverall, P\\u016brbird is king of the coop when it comes to high quality chicken choices, amazing sides, and refreshing drinks. With the close proximity to the railroad, I know I'll be back to flap my wings and chow down until I lay an egg!\", u\"The service was horrible... They got my order wrong. I was waiting for my drink and apparently I didn't order one. So I had to pay again. Then they bring out my food and it was wrong..... idk how they missed chicken breast for French fries. \\nThe little restaurant has a small amount of seating so it isn't good for a big party. What's great is that you pay and then be seated so it isn't like you have to pay tip. The servers just being you your food but you have to get your own drink and utensils which is a little inconvenient. \\nWait time after ordering is about 10 minutes which I was told but it was like 15-ish minutes just for mac and cheese and chicken (which they messed up gave me fries and told me 2 minutes which I waited like 10mins actually).\\nAnyways the mac and cheese was good. Cheesy and topped with baked cheese. Chicken breast had bones in it which I was surprised, but anyways the juice in it was tasty. My friend didn't enjoy the sweet potato fries (she said it was soggy) and my other friend didn't even finish half the sandwich. Overall for about $17 it was average.\", u\"Going to Barclay's and need a fast delicious place to eat?? COME TO PURBIRD.\\n\\nThe chicken is OUT OF THIS WORLD good.\\n\\nI know, I know, the pictures don't look super appetizing, they don't garnish the plate or make anything instagram worthy, but let me tell you, the chicken is so damn good.  Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, no weird chicken textures, simply done, with tons of flavor.\\n\\nI knocked off a star because my side of sweet potato fries definitely sat out for too long - they weren't hot at all.\", u\"3.5 stars\\n\\nI really enjoy the food from Purbird but can someone please explain this to me? \\n\\nA half chicken comes with one sauce\\nA whole chicken comes with one sauce\\nAdditional sauce costs $1.00 (and it's the tiny containers) \\n\\nHow does this make sense? Logically, shouldn't the whole chicken come with two sauces? Because the purbird sauce is crack and one is definitely not enough for an entire chicken, but charging $1 for a tiny container just doesn't seem right. I'm not cheap, I swear. I just think it's the principle. Like who the hell came up with the pricing for this menu? \\n\\nAnyway, my go-to order is the chopped salad, whole chicken, and jalape\\xf1o mashed potatoes (so good). Sometimes I get the fries instead, but they're not crispy FYI.\\n\\nAlso, never do pick up orders unless you're picking up your food right away because the chicken meat becomes tough... and nobody wants tough, chewy chicken meat.\", u\"Got stuck in a torrential downpour, so why not make a pit stop to eat some lunch while letting it pass? Purbird has a good concept. They grill their birds to order, so don't complain for taking so long- you know it's fresh! Did the half chicken with purbird bread and purbird sauce. The chicken had good flavor and was moist, but was much smaller than expected. The bread was really tasty, almost like a garlic flavored pita, and the sauce was so tasty and flavorful. All in all it was a good lunch but may need to add some sides to fill me up next time!\", u'The food here was really great.\\nThe chicken was moist and the skin was crispy and flavorful.\\nDefinitely one of the best.\\nI love the home food feeling.\\nHowever, the price is a little too high for the simple food, and the service was just OK.', u'Very good community corner restaurants. Newly opened. We ordered a whole chicken and 3 sources. \\n\\nPurbird source is sweet and spicy\\nChipotle source is mild spicy \\nMango chutney is very interesting. Give the chicken distinct sweet and sour. \\n\\nMac and cheese is not on the menu, but obviously very popular in this restaurant. \\n\\nSweet potato fries is a little bit soggy.', u\"I'm a little afraid this review is going to earn me higher status on the hated list, but here goes. Purbird isn't the crack it's cracked up to be. As a poulitarian, I take my chicken VERY seriously. I tried this place on 2 occasions and both times thought the chicken was fatty and underwhelming. Maybe the sauce is the key to happiness here. Also, prices are on the higher end, with lunch special for $15. Try the jalape\\xf1o mac and cheese though, the saving grace of Purbird.\", u\"I met a friend who recently moved to the area here for dinner the other night. It was a great spot with fast service-we ordered at the counter and the food came out in a timely manner. The chicken is delicious-very fresh. I recommend the chicken breast sandwich, as I am a huge fan of anything with avocado. This restaurant reminded me of one of my favorite places in London called Nando's. Will definitely return to Purbird for a great meal!\", u'The four of us share a whole chicken and mac-n-cheese. The chicken was simply amazing. Perfectly grilled with crispy, lightly charred skin.  And no bones so you can eat with a fork and knife, which equal to less mess.  For a whole chicken, they only give one sauce. Of the list of sauce, we chose mango chutney. It give the chicken the perfect amount of sweet and tangy taste.  The mac and cheese was just googey cheesy goodness. Enough said.', u'I LOVE THIS PLACE AND CHICKEN!! Ever since coming here, I would have cravings to want their chicken sandwich with bacon. I love their mac and cheese and mashed potato sides! The portion of their sides are too big as sides for me, so I would struggle having to pick only one side along with my favorite chicken sandwich. If I lived closer, this would be my to-go place for lunch or dinner. Definitely will continue to come back to Purbird!!', u\"Purbird is a small intimate chicken dine in/takeout with a limited yet delicious menu. My girlfriend and I decided to go here while in the park slope area,  the atmosphere caught our eye as it looked like a cute cafe.. Or so my girlfriend thought. \\nI ordered the chicken burger with special sauce,  the lady ordered a half chicken and we got two sides (the Mac N cheese and mash potatoes. Both sides were extremely simple and basic,  yet highly addictive. There's nothing 'stand out-ish' about this place besides there true integrity when making these meals. Between the flavor,  the atmosphere and the service... I highly recommend it.\"], u'6.Westville Dumbo': [u\"Was in the area and hungry, looking for a place to eat on here I read a couple of good reviews about this place so I walked in to have lunch...\\nNo regrets:  great atmosphere, welcoming, and great food:\\nHad the 'eclipse mojito' ( very good), quinoa and artichoke burger and watermelon  salad, all very delicious,  highly recommend this place\", u'Okay cant blame the establishment for crying babies. But these Dumbo mothereffing stroller brunchers should really stay home an bond more with their kiddos on their balcony with a bowl of cereal or in the park with a sandwich or a no-baby/stroller policy like coffeeshops have a no laptop rule. Just to offer more convenience...\\nWell having that said. \\nI have never had such a basic cobb salad void of creativity or love. Just greens, chopped bacon chopped chicken some blue cheese and half an avocado  thrown in... THATS IT!! lmfao!! No union not a single cherry . My friends from Europe were happy with their burger, so I am happy. The grits were a new thing for them and they loved it. But my salad ..... ABSOLUTELY love the staff. Kind and service oriented. But they should get a new chef/cook.', u\"Not really sure why this spot gets such high ratings... Food was quite a disappointment. On par with diner food. Had Mexican Cobb Salad special. Not special! Seriously, have had similar and much better with fresher ingredients at other spots for less money. My friend's salmon was standard. Veg was good, but corn app was starchy. Interior Super loud.\\nPros, happy hour extends to tables\\nNice outdoor and semi outdoor seating\\nNice servers\", u'Loved the Sweet Chili Lime Rice Bowl Special w/ kale, farro, carrots, sweet potato, corn & zucchini over brown rice topped w/ dried cranberries & toasted pumpkin seeds', u\"This place is so damn yummy! I really, really enjoyed the food and it was well priced - especially for all the food you get as well as the quality. The drinks were super tasty as well, and I definitely filled up on 'em thanks to our awesome bartender Kylie! She was stellar! I'd say if you are looking for a nice chill place to eat a good meal and enjoy some great drinks, this is definitely a good place for you to check out. They'll take care of you for sure, and you'll leave very happy!\", u\"Westville Dumbo is a neighborhood brunch spot welcoming all kinds of people. There are two inside dining rooms perfect for groups or for couples on a brunch date. If you have a young family or enjoy being outside, there's a large outdoor patio in the back.\\n\\nThe service is great and the food even better. All the ingredients are fresh and change weekly. When we went, we ordered the poached eggs on a kale salad and the roasted brussel sprouts with cucumber lemonade to wash it down. All was really good. The only thing to note is that the brussel sprouts come with a more intense sauce than you'd think. It is layered on there thick and a tad too sweet.\\n\\nFor families, it's the perfect spot. The servers are friendly to kids and they even have a large changing area in one of the unisex bathrooms so Mom or Dad can change the diaper.\", u\"Super casual brunch/lunch/dinner spot with ample seating. Food was delicious but expensive... $28 for a bowl of stir fry over rice and salmon. But it's supposed to be higher quality ingredients so I guess that makes it's ok- for nyc prices. I would come back if it weren't so expensive.\\n\\nWe came on a Sunday night around 6pm, plenty of seats, lots of families and kids running around. They have a lot of options on their menu but we all got the honey chipotle salmon stir, which was a bunch of stir fried veggies over rice with a generous quarter of an avocado and a giant chunk of salmon. Salmon was yummy and crunchy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside. Avocado was perfectly ripe and delicious. Stir fry was great, but the sauce kind of felt like the cheap sweet and sour sauce that you get from chinese take out. I wish they used a different sauce but it was still fine. \\n\\nOur individual bill came up to $28 for one bowl of salmon and veggies which imo is expensive but to each their own. Their drinks looked good but we didn't get any.\", u\"Westville is a food haven for vegetarians and vegetable friends. With a menu focused on seasonal produce, I always leave here feeling refreshed, full, and inspired to cook. There are plenty of options for carnivores, and I think this is one of the few places that can please most palates. Cuisine tilts American, with nods to many other cultural spices and flavors. I've been a fan of their Alphabet City location for a long time, so knowing there is a new Westville in Brooklyn makes me an automatic fan. \\n\\nHubby and I came for an early Sunday 5:30 pm dinner and were seated immediately. The place was actually about half full already and completely full when we left around 6:30 pm, with a small wait out the door. There are three seating areas: the main indoor dining room, the covered patio, and the outdoor patio with picnic tables. The indoor and covered patio areas are best for strollers/wheelchairs, although they may make your table neighbors feel a bit squished. There are two or three neutral bathrooms, one especially large for families and changing tables. I think Westville is nice enough for a casual date or to bring your out of town parents. It's not pretentious, but its bright and charming and very much a neighborhood staple.\\n\\nService is good, with helpful waitstaff that know the menu in and out and a good attention to allergies. They check in often and are pretty friendly. We always had water and plates were cleared quickly. In addition, the kitchen turn over is great, I remember getting our dishes very quickly. \\n\\nThe food is the best! I love love love their market plate, where you pick four different veggies for $17 (as of Aug 2017). The vegetables are super varied, from tofu, to roasted beets with goat cheese and walnuts, watermelon with mint and feta, zucchini with mozz and cherry tomatoes, kimchi cucumbers, dark leafy greens, tofu, potatoes, lentils and beans. The market veggies change seasonally, so it will always mix up if you come frequently. I also like their crab cakes and they make a decent burger and mac and cheese. They also offer cocktails and wine.\", u\"Best delivery I have ever had! Both the chicken with two veggie sides and pear salad were delicious!\\n\\nReally great quality ingredients. I love how they have healthy options that fit a lot of dietary needs. \\n\\nWill be ordering a lot, as the price isn't too bad either. Awesome addition to DUMBO\", u'Exploring DUMBO and ignored our hunger until it was unbearable. We were seated promptly, though my violent hunger was not pleased at the promises of \"cauliflower\" and \"kale\" written on the windows since it felt as though I would only be satisfied with a five pound burger and cheese fries piled to the size of a small animal. Luckily enough, I was in for a surprise.\\n\\nThe service was excellent - we asked to wait for another friend to show up and ordered drinks in the meantime. They were out of the watermelon juice for one of their signature cocktails, but the pineapple margarita special was a good replacement. Naturally starved by then, we placed an order for the Westville Market which is where you choose four of their freshly made veggie sides that come piled separately on one huge plate. Our choices: brussel sprouts (amazing and whatever sauce they are in, I could swim in it), artichokes with Parmesan (amazing because cheese), roasted butternut squash (cooked perfectly but little seasoning - could\\'ve done without these), and zucchini with mozzarella and tomatoes (like a warm veggie salad with cheese - so good, favorite side).\\n\\nThere was a little confusion about who was our waiter/waitress because multiple people checked on us, but that simply meant the service was very attentive, and they were patient when our friend took an extra 20 minutes to show up. We finally ordered our mains, and after stuffing myself with delicious vegetables, I didn\\'t leave much room for a huge main so I opted for the Greek salad which comes with balsamic lemon dill vinaigrette (where can I buy this stuff, it\\'s light but flavorful and heavenly), and a grilled baguette with goat cheese which turned out to be the perfect accompaniment - the other salads come with meat instead but I was on a veggie kick. \\n\\nAnd this was no small salad - it was a big bowl, the size of a small animal (so no need for cheese fries). So if you\\'re feeling like you need to force yourself to eat something green but can\\'t bear the thought of choking down some mysterious green juice, come here, and you\\'ll be satisfied with fun takes on veggies and some fabulous, large-and-in-charge salads. \\n\\nAnd so my only recommendation to Westville is to get rid of the boring-sounding vegetables written on the windows and write \"yes, this is healthy ,but yes, you will be happy.\"', u'Great spot for lunch in the neighborhood. Good selection of market veggies, also has an outside \"to go\" area where you can grab food to go and then sit at the picnic benches to eat.', u\"My boyfriend and I were desperately seeking dinner in the BK area and stumbled upon this place by looking for places here on Yelp. This place was such a great find!\\n\\nIt's a very small and intimate place with a limited menu. Tables are a bit too close together but once you settle in you don't seem to mind at all. It's a very romantic atmosphere and perfect just for couples not large groups as it's a tiny place. \\n\\nI ordered the cuban sliders and my boyfriend ordered the battered fish and chips. I loved my sliders they were perfection! I tasted my bf's meal and the fish was so fresh and clean in taste! We also ordered two glasses of Chardonnay which was fantastic!\\n\\nService was excellent, friendly and speedy. I have no complaints about this place.\", u'Westville Dumbo\\nNY BK Dumbo\\n2pm Wednesday 15th February 2017\\nFour Stars\\n\\nThe place had a 5 minute wait in the afternoon so they must be doing well for themselves. We got water as soon as we sat. I had a cup of coffee and a medium burger with gouda and avocado with a side of roasted Artichoke. The Peruvian bun was delicious and less carry, the burger was tender and juicy, the cheese was shredded instead of a whole slice, the quarter avocado was just plopped on the patty instead of fanned or smashed. The Artichokes were out of a can which was less than I would have expected. The service was exceptionally friendly.', u'Wow, we found both our watering hole and breakfast/brunch weekend stop. Great staff, great food, good prices, and amazing happy hour!!', u'I came here for dinner once a few months ago and remember it being very good. I had some salad special so it\\'s a shame I can\\'t get whatever it was again. Tonight I ordered delivery. They get points for a short wait time. But I\\'m mostly disappointed in the appetizer special described as: Roasted Balsamic Glazed Brussels Sprouts - w/ onions, butternut squash, sweet potato & carrot topped w/ dried cranberries. It\\'s all undercooked. The Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes and carrots are all crunchy. And the amount of Brussels sprouts compared to the toppings was measly. $10? I also got a \"side\\' of hangar steak, which also cost $10. Some bites were incredibly chewy. At least the portion size made more sense for $10. Overall, way too expensive for food that isn\\'t well prepared. Maybe it\\'s better to stick to their salads?', u\"$17 for two thin rubbery breaded chicken cutlets. Yep, that sounds about right for DUMBO.\\n\\nI was super excited for Westville to move into the neighborhood since it's basically a lunch desert in this area and I'd enjoyed the Chelsea location years ago.\\n\\nI placed an order online for pickup (highly recommended since it gets busy). It was ready on time, so no issues there. I also got to take a look inside and the place is great. Lots of natural light and comfortable seating.\\n\\nThe entree came with two sides. I got the roasted beets with goat cheese and the chickpea/eggplant stew. The beets were good but were hardly roasted. Tasted like the kind you get out of a can. The eggplant stew was much better, but not very aesthetically pleasing. Quite the opposite.\\n\\nI'm willing to give Westville another shot, but... maybe on the company's dime.\", u'Been here twice now, the service and quality are excellent, The food  is fresh,delicious, well presented and came out quick, atmosphere is great, friendly owner.\\nSoft, hot yummy bread with fried eggplant and olive oil is the beginning of the perfection. Nice size delicious portions are priced very reasonably. Wonderful restaurant.', u\"Westville is a chain and it's so delicious. Only giving a 4 star this time because the salad I got (cauliflower BBQ quinoa salad) wasn't as good as my regular order (market plate with 4 veggies). Still was very sizable- I brought home leftovers so it was essentially 2 meals. My fianc\\xe9 got the Cobb and loved it. Very spacious and they have an outdoor area. Bathrooms weren't as clean as I'd hope for. In a gorgeous area and perfect for a stop in.\", u\"I was truly impressed by this place! I always visit this restaurant at least once a week and I always left satisfied. Food was great specially the Cobb salad, which was one of my favorites. The service crew was outstanding as well and I had nothing to complain about this place. I will surely introduce this place to my friends and to my love ones. I can't wait to visit this place again!\", u'Brunch was excellent. Had the cauliflower with Tahini and eggs on avocado toast. All great and good service'], u'169.Stone Park Cafe': [u\"Came here for brunch in a group of 5 ladies.\\nWas a really positive experience and I enjoyed the atmosphere. The music playing was good and our waitress was incredibly sweet.\\nThe menu offers so many options, which adds points. There's definitely something for everybody. We got some mimosas and I had ordered the fried oyster po-boy.. and boy, was it delicious! Bread to oyster ratio was perfect.\", u'STONE PARK CAFE - YIPPEEEEEE................. This resto provided such an easy going atmosphere with great people, great staff, and great service.... and not to mention - great food.\\n\\nThe staff was so delightful and professional.... we were treated as regulars - LOL! The food was OMAZING!\\n\\nGot to have items for BRUNCH:\\n1. SHORT RIB HASH, SHORT RIB HASH... if you do not get the entree..... then get is as a SIDE\\n2. Steak and Eggs - Delicious\\n3. Stone Park Burger........ VERY GOOD JUICY BURGER.\\n\\nI will go back for dinner definitely!', u'So utterly disappointing. We went here for brunch on a Saturday at around 2pm. Lots of diners from the main rush of brunch were finishing up and you would think service would be more attentive. The treatment we received was far below par. First of all we were ignored for 10 minutes and we had to flag a staff member over to take our order. She did and we waited anticipating food and drinks to follow. After 15 minutes another staff member shows up and says she would like to take our order. We told her we already did with someone else and she apologized and said she was actually our server. It gets worse: she realizes none of her pens work. So instead of running back to get a working pen she claims she can remember our order. We trusted and repeated our order, which was super simple: chicken Cobb salad and cheese burger (medium). She left to \"put in our order.\" Low and behold, she returns 15 minutes later and says she was too confident and forgot our order, she writes it down this time and leaves again. We were close to leaving at this point but gritted our teeth and waited. Our food arrives, with many errors. My Cobb salad was missing dressing, and my husbands cheese burger was medium well done. She also brought out a side of \"collars greens\" as an apology. We thought the gesture was nice until we tasted them, they literally reminded us of pool water. Food was very disappointing, service was the worst we ever experienced. The only redeeming quality was the excellent bar tender who actually took our order on time, served us delicious drinks. \\n\\nWe will not be returning to stone park cafe again.', u\"Our party of 4 came in one Sunday afternoon a little before 11, right after we had just run a 5k race in Prospect Park. The wait for a table was about 20 minutes, or we had the option of sitting by the bar, which was no wait. We opted for the latter because again, we had just run a 5k and we (and when I say we, I mean I) were hangry. \\n\\nNow I normally don't order omelettes because I feel like I can make pretty good omelettes at home, and they're not usually worth the price tag. And that is probably the main reason I go out to eat - to try foods that I couldn't make (well) at home. However, there was nothing else on the menu that really appealed to me, so the omelette is what I ended up getting. You can choose 4 ingredients, so I went with bacon, tomatoes, spinach, and pepper jack - can't forget the cheese. This came with a side of home fries and toast. \\n\\nThis could be the best omelette I have ever eaten - way better than anything I could ever make at home. The eggs are perfect - not just perfectly cooked, but just perfect. They look so pretty! Plus the home fries, which most other places use as a filler, were pretty good here. So I looked at it more as a complement to the omelette, as opposed to something to make you full because the omelette might not be enough.\\n\\nI only wish Stone Park Cafe was closer to where I lived. Then I could have their omelettes whenever I wanted.\\n\\nTIP - ask for the Salamander hot sauce. This might be my new fave.\", u'I\\'ve forgotten just how much Stone Park has to offer and I\\'m shocked that this is my first review of the place! Well, let me tell you - O M G.  \\n\\nI haven\\'t been to Stone Park in a while, probably because I really did forget just how good it is.  Everything from the service, to the cocktails, to the food and dessert was pretty phenomenal.  \\n\\nDrinks: Passionfruit Cosmo and the Stone Park Negroni were just what was needed this evening.  They were even able to make \"the last word\", which I\\'m told isn\\'t something everyone knows how to make - I personally haven\\'t had that before but I hear the name fits the drink (it was yummy btw).  \\n\\nFood: We shared the Frisee Salad and the Grilled Octopus - just scrumptious.  Oh the bacon in the salad .. I\\'ll be dreaming of you tonight! Definitely love the idea of the crispy poached egg, it added a nice little crunch and flavor to a simple yet delicious dish.  As entrees we had the New Zealand lamb chops, Ricotta cavatelli, and the cod with saffron risotto (I think).  I\\'m absolutely mind blown by the lamb chops - the flavor, the texture, the .. well you get the picture.  They were simply amazing - melted in your mouth.  The cod had such an amazing flavor! Made you want to lick up the plate (too bad we had to refrain haha).  The least impressive dish I\\'d say was the cavatelli - in the presence of such mouthwatering dishes, it was simply underwhelming.  Won\\'t say much about desserts as they were a tad bit too sweet for my taste but my friends definitely enjoyed both.  \\n\\nService: I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen this restaurant not being packed yet the staff remain friendly, attentive, and accommodating.\\n\\nThanks for a great Friday night Stone Park!', u\"Stone Park Cafe always comes up on the top of my brunch searches, but it took me over a year to try it. Maybe I thought it looked a little fancy, so I waited for a weekend where my parents were visiting to test out their brunch.\\nTheir brunch drink menu has a few unique items, I opted for the Passionfruit drink which was a nice departure for the classic mimosa!\\nMom, dad, and myself all ordered different entrees, Duck Hash, Biscuits and Gravy, and the Hangtown Fry. All plates cleared! The Duck hash was one of the best brunch dishes I've had in a while!\", u'First Part of my family member\\'s birthday celebration - Going to Pinot\\'s Palette in Park Slope to participate in an open session of painting on canvases.  We enjoyed creating our \"masterpieces\". Second part of the birthday celebration - having a great dinner at Stone Park Cafe!\\n\\nThings that I truly enjoyed while dining at Stone Park Cafe:\\n\\n1.) The ambiance was fantastic! The cafe is warm and cozy, there is beautiful lighting and their seating arrangement is aesthetically pleasing to the eye. I really appreciated the fact that we were seated comfortably in an area with the heat on because it was so cold outside.\\n\\n2.) Great customer service! Our waitress was friendly and pleasant and made sure that we knew all of the menu specials.  The waitress suggested a fabulous white wine and the staff were very attentive.\\n\\n3.) The food was delicious! The bread was with butter was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I had Lobster Bisque as an appetizer and it was creamy and tasty. My Linguine with Scallops was prepared well. The Scallops were succulent! Another person that I was with raved about their Steak w/ Mashed Potatoes and Saut\\xe9ed Spinach. We were given two dark chocolate complimentary desserts with the bill. \\n\\nI will want to return to the Stone Park Cafe to try other meals on the menu.', u\"I decided to try Stone Park brunch at the recommendation of one of my friends. Overall I was happy with my choice, but can't say that it is the best brunch available in Brooklyn.  So now for the good and bad:\\n\\nThe Good:\\n-Get the French Toast. It is absolutely amazing. Unfortunately I did not select it as my own dish, but my friend let me try theirs and I don't think there are any other French Toast dishes that can compete.  Make sure to drizzle the maple syrup and berry compote on top!\\n-There are tons of coffee selections for a brunch menu--hot or iced coffee, lattes, cappuccinos, espresso. Definitely a win for coffee lovers\\n-Great service. All the servers were very friendly and more than willing to explain the menu and make recommendations\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n-Awful awful brunch drink specials. They have no deals what so ever for any brunch staple (bloody Mary's, mimosas, etc). They are each $10 and nothing special (I got the Bloody Mary and while good it wasn't worth the $10).\\n-The portions of each dish were average/smaller than other locations. I do not think any of the dishes are over priced by any means, but if you have a large appetite I would recommend adding side dishes.\\n\\nRecommendations\\nDrink:\\n--Black Coffee or Latte\\n\\nMain Dish:\\n--French Toast\\n**get it with the spicy pork sausage (I forget the name\\nOf it but the staff will be able to guide you)\\n--Eggs Benedict\", u\"One of the better restaurants I've been to in a really long time. I treated my friend here for a birthday dinner and we both had such an amazing time. Our server Tim was amazing and made the best recommendations!\\n\\nI ordered from the prix fixe market menu for $38...which included:\\n1) Appetizer - The Gnocchi with Oxtail was absolutely breathtaking. The gnocchi was made fresh and cooked so well. It was chewy like marshmallows and the savory taste from the oxtail was simply amazing.\\n2) Entree - 4 Scallop grilled perfectly with string beans. My favorite part of this dish was the sweet potato layered with onions and potatoes. \\n3) Chocolate Pecan pie - I wasn't in love with this but it was very rich in flavor.\\n\\nFriend ordered:\\n1) Grilled octopus - (poached fingerlings, Spanish chorizo, preserved lemon) - grilled beautifully and it had a soft yet chewy texture. \\n2) Squid Ink Tagliatelle - (grilled calamari, bacon, tomatoes, lobster demiglace) - Love the flavoring. Both calamari and pasta were made fresh here.\\n\\nI had an amazing dinner here and would love to come back again!\", u\"Good: location, friendliness, space, and decor. This place is homey, comfy, and a local favorite. The food is great- try a homemade biscuit or (tiny) homemade English muffin. The eggs are the freshest I've ever had, and the omelette a are very well made. Tasty coffee. Quality ingredients. \\n\\nImprovements: more gluten-free options, allowing for substitution (clearly indicated no on the menu).\", u'I came to Stone Park Cafe on a nice Sunday afternoon. I was told that it would be about a 45 minute wait for a table. I had tried to call an hour or so prior but there were no reservations for brunch. There was no way that I was going to wait 45 minutes for eggs. Steak maybe, but not eggs. Luckily there were a few spots at the bar so I decided to just eat there. The bartender was really nice and the food came out quickly. I tried the following:\\n\\nBiscuits & Gravy w/ eggs: This was definitely my favorite dish. The biscuits and the gravy were flavorful and delicious. If I come back here for brunch I would definitely get this dish.\\n\\nCorn Beef Hash w/ poached eggs: The eggs were good, The corn beef was okay to me. The beef was actual pieces of beef (and by that I mean not ground beef) which was nice but the dish did not blow my mind and it was cold. \\n\\nPancakes & Sausage: I was told that it tasted like McDonalds breakfast. Now I actually like McDonalds breakfast but the price point is clearly different here so that\\'s not cool.\\n\\nOverall this place is hip. Tons of young people, very crowded. One of those \"places to be.\" I would return but I am in no rush to do so.', u\"It is hard getting a table here for weekend brunch. What, call off work sick one day just to come here for weekday lunch instead? That's crazy! A crazy good idea, because that's what I did. \\n\\nEverything at Stone Park Cafe is terrific. We started with the Octopus ceviche with avocado. First off, the presentation of it was adorable and it was beyond delicious. A very light dish to kick off your meal. I'm a sucker for squid ink tagliatelle, so that's what I ordered here. It was a little too creamy, taking away from the flavor of the pasta and the seafood. But the second pasta we ordered--the fresh Linguini--man, that one was top notch. Fresh clams, buttery & flavorful sauce--this one took the cake. \\nSpeaking of cake, figs were in season which meant they were offering a lovely fig cake for dessert. This was amazing! It was warm and incredibly moist, with a tasty scoop of ice cream on top. \\n\\nNow I'm not condoning playing hooky of any kind, but if you perhaps find yourself craving pasta on an unexpectedly free weekday lunch in the area, this might be the place for you.\", u\"The definition of a perfect brooklyn brunch spot. \\n\\nFriendly staff, great food, terrible parking, indoor and outdoors seating (to accommodate our furry companions) and a farmers market around the corner. \\n\\nThe wait can be long but there are tons of shops and the market in the area to keep you busy. The food and coffee is delicious. You never feel rushed... just as brunch should be. It's great that they can accommodate large and small groups and honestly you don't feel too packed in (even though you are).\", u\"On my recent visit to New York my aunt took us to dinner at Stone Park Cafe, which is apparently one of her favorite restaurants in one of her favorite neighborhoods.  Admittedly, I wasn't feeling well so I didn't enjoy the experience as much as I could have, but I can see why it would be a favorite!\\n\\nThe atmosphere is classy meets hipster, without too much of either.  Service was on point; he had great recommendations for food, seemed to know the wine list really well, and could hold a nuanced conversation about IPAs.  You don't hit three for three very often.  Everyone liked what they ordered; the lamb chop, fish special and wonton soup appetizer were all hits.  I thought the burger could have been seasoned a bit more, but the meat was good quality and it was grilled well.  For dessert, the mocha chocolate ice cream was excellent.\\n\\nA lot of the menu sounded really good, and the price point is reasonable for the neighborhood.  I'd recommend a visit if you're a visitor or a local.\", u'Came here on a chilly fall day but was comforted by the nice decor & relaxing ambience inside. While the menu isn\\'t fancy, the atmosphere is quite elegant--but no worries, just come in casual wear. \\n\\nThis was the first time I had a salad for brunch and I have to say--best Cobb salad ever!! Of course the blue cheese was a little too much, but everything else was perfect (especially the egg and avocado; you guessed it). My friend had the short ribs & eggs with bread on the side, but didn\\'t think it was too good. I tried the meat though and it was pretty great!\\n\\nOverall, nice brunch spot. The only \"complaint\" I have is that the music playlist seems to be 8 years behind...but who doesn\\'t love listening to some old Fergie & JT on a Saturday afternoon?', u\"Friday night dinner review \\n\\nDuck confit pizzette - thin crisp bread topped with creme fraiche, tomatoes, duck confit, and topped with arugula. There wasn't much duck confit and I actually could of done without.\\n\\nSwiss chard raviolini had tons of mushrooms and pine nuts. The sage brown butter sauce was much lighter than I thought it would be. Husband liked his burger, subbed the fries for onion rings which were light and crispy served with chipotle aioli. \\n\\nMeyer lemon cake was good (a tad dry) served with strawberry sauce and toasted marshmallow (dessert special).\\n\\nOverall a nice dining experience but wasn't wowed by the food.\", u\"It's not that this place was bad, but with so many great restaurants around Park Slope this brunch really did not stand out to me - which is why I'm rating it quite low. For the price compared to the taste of the food, I would give it a 3.5 and I'm not so sure I would come back to try it again. \\n\\nI ordered the Pan Seared bluefish cakes which came with eggs benedict. When ordering, I made sure to specify that I wanted the white of the Benedict cooked all the way through. The server assured me that their restaurant is pretty good about not having runny whites. \\n\\nWhen the dish arrived, the bluefish cakes were good and the eggs seemed to be made well until I cut into them. There was still some white which wasn't cooked all the way through and it mixed in with my yolk. The dish came with home fries, celery root slaw and sourdough toast which was burnt. I also ordered the cheesy polenta on the side, good but unusually creamy. \\nMy boyfriend ordered the short-rib hash with eggs - decent, a little dry but couldn't say it was delicious.\\n\\nI guess what was most disappointing is the taste of their Bloody Mary. It was spicy and had a decent amount of alcohol but I was very disappointed with the Bloody Mary mixture itself. The tomato juice tasted diluted, bland and did not have enough texture - felt watery to me. For a highly rated brunch place, I was disappointed they did not have a good Bloody Mary. \\n\\nAnother inconvenience was that the restaurant held an additional charge (more than our meals worth) which had been pending for several days. The only charge that cleared was the actual charge but it is an inconvenience for those paying with a debit card as the bank takes out the money until the pending charge is cleared. \\n\\nOverall, brunching at this place was not very memorable. I hope if we do choose to come back, we can find something on the menu that we could rave about. My plate did not look NEARLY as good as some of the other yelpers photos. Will be attaching photos along with my review.\", u\"Yay, I'm truly a fan of them! lol\\n\\nIt's packed for the brunch, but the wait wasn't long coz we agreed to take the seats under the sun without any shade, 5 mins later we were both regret! hahaha\\n\\nThe servers are nice, we asked to change seats and got seat inside immediately. Lucky and Thanks!\\n\\nMy bf ordered burger and Bloody Mary, (typical American, isn't he? haha), I ordered quesadilla with fresh orange. The food was incredible, burger was really juicy and taste, the meat just well grilled, as to a quesadilla fan myself, I love it a lot. The wrap was crispy, not the as the regular one we normally have, with egg, jack cheese and good amount of heat from jalapeno, heeaven in my mouth~ ;D\\n\\nWe got our drinks kinda late while we half done with our food, we had to remind our waitress that they forgot our drinks. But totally understandable since it's a packed Sunday.\\n\\nI would give 5 stars if it isn't the Bloody Mary was really bad. It's really bitter, and unbearable spicy hot! My bf had to ask more tomato juice to mix it in, but still over spicy. The girl sat next to me couldn't stop cough and in tears coz of that.\\n\\nAnyway, it is a must, definitely would go back!\", u\"Back at here today but this time on a Saturday afternoon about 12:30-1pm. Came with a friend got got seated very easily due to small group. Others had to wait like 40mins for a group of 5 so it depends. The waiter was really nice, mannered and made sure our food and drink was good. He came a few times to check on us and wasn't rushing us out or anything due to busy hours. \\nI ordered the bluefish cake this time and it came with poached eggs, potatoes and bread of your choice(white, whole, rye). The bluefish cake was so so to me. I didn't feel it tasted that great along with the eggs and bread. But nonetheless, the eggs and everything else was delicious!! It was nice to try a different dish today. Coming back for others to try.\\nMy friend ordered the shirt rib with sunny side eggs and looks like a full plate of food. Looks very soft, enough sauce and smooth texture. Can't go wrong with that! Must try next time! Definitely recommend this spot to chit chat and just enjoy. \\nParking was very easy today as well. :)\", u\"I've been here a few times and I always enjoy myself. The food is delicious and consistent. It's a bit out of the way but if you manage not to get distracted by the options on 5th Ave as you make the journey to Stone Park then it's worth it!\\n\\nFor brunch I would recommend the bloody mary and eggs with their brisket hash.\\n\\nFor dinner don't miss out on the brisket on potatoe roll and creamy greens. It's a tiny little thing that will make your wallet hurt but it's delicious. The seafood linguini dish is very nice as well but tbh I don't recall it so maybe a touch underwhelming. I would say go for half portions if you want to try a few things since the serving is generous.\"], u'124.Chavela\\u2019s': [u\"I've been going to Chavela's since it was a hole in the wall (maybe 6 tables?) joint on Classon Ave, back in 2007. The food is consistently delicious, from the potato flautas, tortilla soup (sooo so good!) and queso fundido, to the chicken mole, and eggless plato don. I'm a fan.\\n\\nThe prices are super reasonable - 13.95 for brunch - Chavela's is a standout in a neighborhood with restaurants of a higher price-point.\", u\"My best friend and I picked this restaurant based on the funky vibe in the pictures and the number of positive reviews on yelp, and we were not disappointed! We came in around five in a Saturday night, and we're seated immediately. There was a number of cute outdoor tables, but we opted to stay inside. The inside space was smal but comfortable. \\n\\nOur waiter was attentive and very helpful. We opted to spilt a few appetizers, which were all very tasty. The guacamole was  standard but good, the taquitos, and the esquitas was very good. The queso fundido was not a dip, like I was expecting, but very good! We needed to ask for salsa, it wasn't given with chips when you sat down like other places, but it was given to us without charge when we requested it. Churros for desert were amazing and authentic! \\n\\nAs for drinks, the Paloma was a standout. Super smooth, not too sweet, and it had a chili lime rim. They also poured the wrong margarita by mistake, and gave it to us  free of charge, which was nice! \\n\\nAll and all, we will be back!\", u'Looking for excellent, affordable Mexican food in Crown Heights? Then Chavela\\'s is your place. The only drawback here is the small, crowded space (albeit one beautifully decked out with Mexican art and hanging chandeliers). Unless you\\'re a small party coming in during off hours, expect some sort of wait.\\n\\nThe menu is almost diner-like in its extensiveness. Tortas, enchiladas, chilaquiles, tacos - you can get it all. We kicked off our meal with guacamole and chips, which was both fresh and filling. I also appreciated that the chips they used, or \"totopos,\" were HUGE. Think 2 inches in diameter. There were also crispy, making them an ideal vehicle for the creamy guac.\\n\\nAs for my main entree, I went with the mole enchiladas. Very tasty. I liked that they give you generous portions of beans and rice on the side, and that they don\\'t skimp on the mole sauce. The tortillas they used tasted freshly made, and the chicken was well seasoned, although a *tad* dry. And $16 definitely felt like a fair price for a delicious and filling entree.\\n\\nThe margaritas are also solid - although not revelatory - and weirdly, come in highball glasses (as opposed to the lowball glasses I\\'m used to). I also hear that the sangria pitchers are also excellent.\\n\\nSo all in all, does Chavela\\'s change the game for Mexican food? Not really. But it does the standards very well, and in a beautifully designed space to boot.', u\"Five star flavor! Chavela's is about a ten minute walk from the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens. We ventured to Chavela's after a long day of exploring and were starving. The restaurant is spacious inside plus offers outdoor seating. It was the most crowded in the area which is always a good sign. \\n\\nPrices were decent. The tacos were around $4 each. I ordered the steak, pork enchilada and fish tacos. All were amazing but the fish tacos stood out the most. My fianc\\xe9 ordered the pork Enchilada \\nTorta ($9) which was surprisingly large. Again, the flavor was exquisite. I'd never heard of this place and so glad we stumbled upon it. We plan on returning on a Friday after work for happy hour which offers $3 tacos, $4 beers and $5 cocktails. Can't beat it.\", u\"I love the family style options served here. If you are going out with the girls, this is the place to get a great margarita and great eats. Don plata carne rocks!  It was crowded on Friday but managed to snag a table. We had a great time as we caught up and munched. Didn't leave feeling overly full or like I took in excessive salt. Overall great spot!\", u\"This is a hip, fun, crowded, and clearly popular restaurant in Crown Heights. There is limited outdoor seating, but they really do cram as many tables as possible. \\n\\nThis is probably not the idea place for a Friday or Saturday night date unless you plan to shout. \\n\\nThe host stand is crammed into a corner to the left when you enter. The inside is narrow, with the bar on the right side and a row of tables on the left. \\n\\nThe service was fast, and we were able to walk up and get a table right away, with no wait.\\n\\nNo complimentary chips & salsa here. My friend and I got $3.50 avocado tacos, cheese/jalape\\xf1o tamale, and chips and trio salsa. The appetizer and entree delivery was paced well. The food was presented appealingly on the plate, tasted fresh, and was satisfying. The chips in the chips and salsa were round, flat tostada shells as true Mexican food, not like the standard tortilla chips you'd get at Tex-Mex places. The tacos were the common double-wrapped corn tortillas you'd find in Mexico. \\n\\nThe prices were very reasonable. I paid $20, which included tax and a 22% tip. \\n\\nI did not leave hungry. I'd definitely return, but it's important to note that there aren't a whole lot of vegetarian or vegan options.\", u\"Chavela is the definition of a solid restaurant. The food isnt 5 stars but its really good. The drinks aren't mixologist but they are really good. And for the price Chavelas is a must visit. They have a great happy hour with 3$ tacos and $6 sangria $7 margaritas. \\n\\nThe tacos are super juicy and tasty although they have more of a tex mex flavor than an authentic mexican flavor. However that tex mex categorizes\\nMost of the food you'll get in crown heights. \\n\\nWhere chavelas really differentiates itself is price and decor. Its beautiful place with prices that wont break the bank.\", u\"The Plato Don is a must!! Everything in that platter is delicious!! Their guacamole is to perfection! The prices are reasonable, the Plato Don is $19 is you choose chicken & beef & it's good for two people. The drinks are yummy.\", u\"Finally, finally got to cross this off my yelp list! With only a couple of months left in the area, I knew I had to plan to come here soon. I called ahead to check the wait time. On a Saturday night at 6:30, there was no wait. But when bf and I arrived at 7, we had to wait a little under 20min. Sweet!!\\n\\nORDER\\n- Queso fundito: Mini cheesy taco making appetizer for the bf bc he was starving. You get to choose either mushrooms or chorizo, and the bf chose chorizo. There was a slow heat that could be tamed with a couple sips of marg and water.\\n- Plato don carne: Big bang for buck!! Comes with steak, chicken, black beans, rice, and small side of pico de gallo, guacamole, and cheese. The tortillas were so cute and tiny. We did have to order extra tortillas to finish the toppings. Tortillas taste like and have similar texture to corn tortilla, but it's flour apparently.\\n-Margarita traditional: loaded with ice, but still good.\\n\\nService was a bit slow. It was hard to flag our waitress down to order extra tortillas and have them served to us. The place is super cramped and the music loud, so be prepared to speak up and bump elbows. I would definitely come back to try the brunch specials and happy hour drinks and tacos.\", u\"This was really just OK. Great location, in a fun vibe of a neighborhood. Stopped by after a long, exhausting day of apartment searching and needed food in our stomach. The interior was pretty cool but the food was average. We shared a Don Plato of Carne and it was filling, but the chicken tasted slightly of game and the beef was sparse and stringy. \\n\\nWe decided to order the churros for dessert but it really lacked in flavor. Not enough sugar or cinnamon. That churro definitely got a lot of dipping into the chocolate sauce! Good service, a bit pricey. But I'd liken it to a Dos Caminos/Rosa's Mexicano except their food tastes slightly better. We wanted to like this place more... but couldn't. Loved the mango juice though!\", u'We had a family gathering here and service was flawless. There was a line out the door, but there was no wait for our large group. However, groups of two people had to wait 45 mins. Our waitress was busy, but she was quick. \\n\\nWe tried a bunch of dishes... started with guacamole, chips, and 3 different kinds of salsa. We ordered the vegetarian platos don and the meat one, tacos (chicken, fish, and steak), chicken flautas, fish tostadas, and tamales. For dessert we went for the churros with chocolate sauce! The food was delicious! Drinks were as well. But back to that chocolate sauce!!! I could drink it up by itself. No churros needed.', u\"This is the best Mexican I've found in NYC - and I'm from California and Arizona, so I'm a snob about Mexican food. GREAT flavor. Awesome margaritas and drinks. Reasonably priced. Highly recommended!!!\", u'This spot perplexes me:\\n\\nYou see, the food here was far from fantastic.  And yet, each time I\\'ve ever walked by, the place has not only been packed, there have been people waiting outside for tables to vacate.  Am chalking it up to a phenom I like to call, \"liquor people up with some decent Margaritas to wash down Chips & Guac in a festive dining space and they will come.\"\\n\\nThe only thing I can say I truly enjoyed and would order again is the moist, flavor-packed Chicken Mole Tamale.  Everything else, including a bunch of Tacos and a Chicken Tinga Quesadilla was utterly forgettable.  And I would go so far as to say, do not order the Queso Fundido.  The melted Oaxacan cheese that topped it was way too much like mozzarella for me and the beans were bland and boring.    \\n\\nService was pleasant and patient.  It was also extraordinarily efficient.  They don\\'t f*ck around when it comes to turning tables here.\\n\\nIn the end, I liked the little buzz I got from my Margarita, which also happened to taste pretty good.  Good enough to add an extra star to an otherwise mediocre food experience.', u\"My favorite Mexican place in the neighborhood. The decor is beautiful (look up at the ceiling next time you're there) and the food is amazing. My personal favorites are the pescado (fish) taco and the chicken flautas. The margaritas and churro s are also delicious. Every time I go, I leave completely stuffed and wondering why I don't go more often. Yum.\", u'I love this place ! I only went for brunch but food was great ! Service was fast , they have a crowd so arrive early lovely curb side seating', u'This is the best Mexican food Ive had in the east coast. Hands down. \\nI got two quesadillas: rajas con queso and tinga. so good. And the most perfect horchata- not watery or too thick, but the slightly sweet drink I needed today.\\nThe service was quick and friendly. \\nI wish I lived nearby so I could come here everyday.', u'Amazing layout. Food is outstanding.\\nI recommend getting the Tinga Quesadilla (sweet and savory), the Bistec (beef taco) and chicken con mole taco.\\n\\nMargaritas are pretty good. Prices are a lil high for them. \\n\\nExcellent service from the hostess and the waitress.', u\"Good food at a great price, what more can you ask for?! I haven't yet found my favorite dish at this place, everything is fantastic! I do happen to get the torrejas the most at brunch, and their chorizo hash is on point. Make sure you get a handmade margarita and not the one on draft. Might be a couple bucks more, but totally worth it. You can't really go wrong with anything on the menu, and he open air feeling you get makes it a must to stop by if you're in the area!\", u\"I've avoided Chavela's for a long time. I think it's because friends who have lived in this neighborhood longer than me say that it lost its charm after moving from its former, much tinier and cuter, location over on Classon. I never went to the old spot myself, so I eventually had to give new-Chavela's a try. I mean, you can't live in ProCro* and not go to Chavela's. \\n\\nThe first time was for drinks. My friend and I had sangria and it was blah. I'll take the fault for that one though...you don't order sangria at a Mexican restaurant. \\n\\nThe second time was for brunch. It was over the summer. They don't have A/C; just fans. The tables/seats were all crammed close together. And since Chavela's is a staple ProCro eatery, of course it was packed for Saturday brunch. All of this to say, it was HOT in there. But maybe they do that on purpose so that you'll keep ordering their delicious, and tall, margaritas. Well played, Chavela's.\\n\\nFor food I got the huevos divorciados and I LOVED them. It's a pretty simple dish: 2 fried eggs w/ 2 types of sauce, potatoes, and refried beans. Some might say the portions are small, but I thought it was perfect. Not too heavy and very tasty. \\n\\nAll the brunch dishes come with Mexican sweet bread. I like the idea of it, but ours was pretty dry and flavorless. \\n\\nOverall, Chavela's is not bad. The food and margs won me over.\\n\\n*Prospect Heights/Crown Heights border. ProCro. Get it? #sorrynotsorry\", u\"Finally tried Chavela's last night after living in the neighborhood for nearly a year. Every night in my walk home Chavela's is packed, so I was expecting delicious food and amazing service. And for the most part that's what we got. \\n\\nWe were seated right away; had a table outside. Not a lot of room here, I found it cozy. But if you're used to spreading out it may be too intimate for your tastes....\\n\\nSpeaking of tastes, the chips & guac were fresh and flavorful, with just the right amount of heat.\\n\\nWe split the cheese enchiladas with verde. Very straight forward, but delicious.\\n\\nThe best part of our meal was dessert!....we had the fried plantains with berry compote and dulce de leche ice cream. Wow. This was next level, and definitely the favorite part of our meal!\\n\\nBesides the food, the servers were friendly and attentive!\\n\\nGlad we finally made it in, and can't wait to go back!\"], u'33.Ela Taverna': [u'Such a homie Greek vibe when I walked in here. \\n\\nLoved everything our group ordered. Quiet a few things actually but we got to taste a little bit of everything which I loved! \\n\\nStarted off with calamari, octopus, zucchini chips which was really crispy and zucchini cakes. \\n\\nEnded with some juicy LAMB \\n\\nAnd the bartender Theodore gets a 5 star for his customer service. Recommended few cocktails and very attentive ! \\n\\nDef coming back to get my Greek feast on!', u'Great addition to the neighborhood. \\n\\nPositives: delicious food (mmm haloumi cheese) with plenty of seafood options, cozy Mediterranean atmosphere (esp in back), and friendly and hospitable staff.\\n\\nRoom for improvement: wine options a bit limited and specialty cocktails would be cool.', u'Service was amazing and the food was even better. Williamsburg is lucky to have such a great establishment in its presence! Will definitely be coming back \\n\\nPs. Meat platter is killer', u\"Tried Ela for the first time this Sunday and just loved it! They have a separate brunch menu, but my husband and I decided to mix it with some tapas from the regular menu because there were so many dishes that sounded amazing. \\n\\nWe shared the feta in phyllo dough and that was just delicious! Zucchini croquettes were great as well and our brunch egg plates were tasty, but we couldn't get over how good the feta in phyllo was. Yum yum! Everything comes in super generous portions which makes it very good value for money. We even had to take a doggie bag and skipped the complimentary dessert tasting (which I kind of regretted afterwards :-) ). \\n\\nBesides the food they offer really great service as well. Friendly owner and staff, the place just opened about a month ago and you can see they are really making an effort to pay personal attention to every customer and serve great food. \\n\\nI'm sure I will be back here soon and wish them all the best in making this restaurant a success!\", u'What can I say?  This is as authentic as they come and dare I say may be even better than even the most authentic that Astoria has to offer.  Each dish was made masterfully and transports you to some distant island in the Aegean.  Everything was absolutely delicious. Must try are the kolokithokeftedes, the loukaniko, and pretty much all the appetizers. I suggest sharing meze style. I did not try any of the main courses so I cannot speak for them but definitely going to go back to give it a try.', u'Three of us stopped into this bustling restaurant on a raucous Saturday night.  Sat in the \"courtyard\"  it was fun, loud and delicious.  All the servers were very friendly.  The food was amazing.  We got a bunch of appetizers and good wine.  The charcoal grilled veggies!  The Spanakopita!...  so good.', u'This place is great! Excellent food, affordable wine and on top of all that, amazing service. Solid vegan options too.', u\"The food was absolutely great! Very authentic and traditional Greek and Mediterranean food. Also very fairly priced, especially for the neighborhood. The owner was very nice and offered us a complimentary desert which I'm craving right now just thinking about it. Get the Horiatiki (best greek salad I ever tried) and Saganaki (fried heavenly cheese). Enjoy. Thank me later.\", u\"Fantastic food - not just for the area (better than mp taverna at half the price). Authentic food - owned and operated by very nice Greek people.  Great Greek wine and beer.  Try the saganaki and mousaka.  The kebabs also were excellent.  I'm just so excited that there's finally a good Greek place I williamsburg !! Keep it up!\", u'Great experience on a lovely summer evening. Food was delicious and fresh, service was very friendly and engaging. Soundtrack even hit the spots. Highly recommend', u\"Really unfortunate experience here. Came in with a friend for dinner on a Monday night. The place was nearly empty. We ordered sparkling water, the waiter brought out the bottle which was still was not open. We couldn't unscrew it so we asked the guy to open it for us, which he did, but STILL did not pour us any water. Throughout the dinner noone came up to us once to ask if we needed anything. \\n\\nWhen my entree came, i ordered a fish entry which came with a side of wilted greens, they only brought out the fish first and i had to wait at least 10 minutes if not longer for my greens and had to ask the waitress several times. Who brings food fish without any sides and makes you wait so long? Then when the greens finally came, they tasted awful, so i did not eat it. The fish was good.\\nOf course noone came to check to see how things were, so i only ended up the fish alone. Later when the waitress came she asked how everything was and i told her about the side and how uneatable it was, she seemed shocked. She brought out some sort of a dessert to us on the house i guess to compensate for the bad side sent earlier, but the dessert did not taste good at all. So we did not eat it. We asked for the check which took forever to get and to pay, had to chase the waitress multiple times. They only had a few tables at that time and the plenty of staff that seemed to be just hanging out. Later the owner (or manager) came up to us asking about about the wilted greens side and asked what was wrong with it, which we explained and he said he will send a dessert type of alcoholic drink which we politely declined, but he was persisting and we had to say NO several times and ask to settle the bill. \\nOverall, not a great experience with poor service.\", u'Great food, HUGE portions! So dont order a lot, unless you r a big group. Waitress was friendly and fast with the service. I def will be back', u\"charming wait staff, very friendly, delicious egg lemon soup, classic greek hospitality, even gave me a complimentary dessert and advice on where to travel in greece! you won't be disappointed!!!\", u\"Not paid. Not a friend of the owners. So excited to have real unpretentious Greek in the neighborhood. Everything was great. Ordered way too much. Lamb ribs, pork kebab, tzatziki. Octopus tender, horiatiki salad legit, not trying to be fancy or overpriced. Meats real charcoal grilled. Can't wait to make it a regular stop, instead of always planning to go to Astoria and never making it there. Good luck guys!\", u\"Service is wonderful, and the place has a great atmosphere looking out onto the street. We loved the complimentary warm pita and hummus while you wait to order and sample of dessert wine to finish the meal. Feta cheese wrapped in phyllo with mint & honey? Can't wait to have it again! Thanks Ela.\", u\"I've ordered from this place via seamless three times already. Excellent Greek food and in a great location! Next time I plan to eat in .\", u'Great food, generous portions, true Greek hospitality. Definitely coming back. Rare to find such a good value in this neighborhood.', u\"Ela is such a great addition to the neighborhood.  I've eaten there twice now and also gotten delivery.  The staff has been incredibly friendly and helpful both times I was there, and the food (the warm pita, the zucchini croquettes, and the horiatiki salad in particular) is all really fantastic.  They also gave us a free dessert both times we were there and a free dessert wine once.\", u'Great place!! Authentic Greek food, family-run vibe, attentive service and very nice people. Garden salad, grilled octopus & house wine were all excellent! I had a great meal here and will be coming back and telling friends.', u'Walked in for lunch on a Sunday. Greek salad and meatballs were fantastic. Mousaka, Leek pie, grilled octopus were all solid too. The service was excellent and friendly. Reasonable prices, lunch for four was about $60'], u'74.ICHIRAN': [u'Ichiran Ramen, one of the most highly-regarded Tonkotsu Ramen shops from Fukuoka, Japan, made its way onto American soil in October 2016.  I was able to go visit it shortly before its 1-year anniversary.  When I arrived, I began to wonder why they chose such a random area of Brooklyn for their restaurant.  Don\\'t expect to do much in this area except enjoy a bowl of ramen and leave.\\n\\nI went during the afternoon on a weekday, and it wasn\\'t busy at all.  Ichiran is very known specifically for partitioned booths for solo dining, as well as having the ability to fully customize your bowl of ramen from seasoning stock (dashi), richness, garlic, scallions, sliced pork (chashu), spicy red sauce (Hiden no Tare), and noodle texture.  They also have add-ons like noodle refilling (Kae-Dama) and extra ramen toppings and sides you can choose from.\\n\\nThis location has 30 partitioned solo booths.  When the place gets busy, there\\'s also a large waiting area on the other side of the host counter.  When seated, there are hooks for jackets, and they even have hooks underneath the booth for any handbags.  The partitions between the booths can be folded away if you dine with anybody else so you can share the counter space.  Each booth has all of the information you need from a paper menu to fill out, a history of the restaurant, and styles on how to eat certain items on their menu.  There is also a note explaining that this restaurant is a no-tip establishment... how Japanese!\\n\\nI went with their Classic Tonkotsu Ramen for $18.90, and I customized it according to how they would normally serve it.  The only thing I changed is that I increased the spiciness level because I like my ramen like I like my women... spicy as f*ck.  ANYWAYS, I also added a Tonkotsu Egg for $2.90.  This is an egg cooked inside of their classic tonkotsu pork bone broth and a secret marinade until the egg becomes fully-cooked and seasoned throughout.  I also ordered an Ichiran Original Matcha Draft Beer for $9.90.  This is an Asahi draft beer with matcha green tea powder mixed throughout.\\n\\nWhen I was ready to order, I pressed the call button ahead of me, and I was served right away.  I gave them my order with the filled-out paper menu.  After a few minutes, my Matcha Draft Beer arrived.  It was really green!  Then, my Tonkotsu Egg came out.  You\\'re supposed to eat this prior to the ramen as the texture and taste of the egg acts as a palette resetter.\\n\\nThe beer tasted normal going down, and it had a delicious green tea aftertaste.  Since the Tonkotsu Egg had been cooked in the ramen broth and a special marinade, you could actually taste it with each bite through the egg white!  I usually have an egg in my ramen, but this was different for me as the egg was actually dry and used as a palette resetter.  I was now ready for the main item!\\n\\nIchiran really understands that with each passing second in the broth, the noodle actually expands, so they deliver the bowl of ramen as fast as possible.  They recommend to take about 3-4 spoonfuls of the broth without any of the ingredients and slurp it down before gradually adding the other items.  They say this is to help you understand and experience the various noodle textures and broth intensities.  \\n\\nI didn\\'t understand why they called the Hiden no Tare a \"sauce\" when it is literally just ground-up spices.  It\\'s not saucy at all and does not change the color of the broth, so don\\'t expect a rapid change when mixing the spices in.  The ramen was definitively delicious, but unfortunately, it didn\\'t have that spicy kick that I enjoy.  After eating all of the ingredients, there was still a bit of broth left.  At this point, I could have had Kae-dama (noodle refilling), but I was already much too full.  I slurped down a bit more broth and pressed the call button to get the bill.\\n\\nThe service here was really on point.  They worked quickly and were very respectful.  They even bowed to me like I was in Japan.  It is really not something I am used to living here in the United States.  I was quickly given the bill and walked up to the front to pay.  For a ramen experience, this was absolutely fun, but it was also very expensive.  My sister-in-law is from Japan and would not typically pay more than $10 for a bowl of ramen.  This Ichiran bowl itself without the egg or beer was already double that price, even if tips were not wanted at this establishment.\\n\\nI did enjoy my time experiencing Ichiran Ramen.  The ramen, egg, and beer were all good, but I really can\\'t get over the location of the restaurant.  I don\\'t understand why they chose this random area of Brooklyn for their location.  If I was a local, I would come here once just to try it, but the price and location alone would have me consistently going elsewhere for my ramen fix.  I did love how authentically Japanese Ichiran was for being in the United States, but again, this will definitely be a one-time experience for me.', u\"Best ramen I've had. I'm normally not a fan of ramen with simple broths- every time I order ramen, I make sure to order one that's spicy so it has a lot of flavor. This ramen, however, I really enjoyed!\\n\\nI chose to go with medium dashi (seasoning stock), medium richness, medium garlic, with scallion and chashu (sliced pork), medium hiden no tare (spicy red sauce), and soft noodle texture (I prefer my ramen on the softer side than firm). I also ordered a 1/2 order of the kaedama. I added on the simmered pork belly with dried seaweed, tonkotsu egg, kikurage mushroom, and dried seaweed. \\n\\nThe broth was flavorful and my ramen was slightly spicy. I would have preferred a little bit more spice. The pork belly was so delicious with the chili powder they provide. The seaweed was roasted with a lot of flavor after soaking up the pork flavor from the broth. The kikurage mushroom added a crunchy texture. The egg was my favorite part! Hard-boiled, but super flavorful and a great precursor to my ramen. \\n\\nGreat service as well. I would highly recommend sitting at the booths - it's nice because they have coat hooks behind you, but also purse/bag handles right under your booth. Tissues are located above the coat hooks. You can collapse the wall in between you and your dining partner, which my SO and I did to share the pork belly. I took away one star because it was quite pricey for ramen; but I would definitely still come back!\", u'Solid ramen.\\n\\nGreat broth with perfect noodles. \\n\\nBroth:\\nI got the \"rich\" broth with added \"spiciness\" and \"garlic\". The depth of the broth was incredible. Soooo pork boney and rich but at the same time, I was still able to take a variety of complex flavors such as ginger, garlic, and chili.\\n\\nNoodles:\\nI chose medium firmness for the noodles. The noodles initially had a little snap to it but by the end of the eating session, it was soft but not soggy or plump at all.\\n\\nAnother excellent add on one should order is the pork belly with dried seaweed. So flavorful, so melt in mouth.\\n\\nSkip the egg, it was a tad on the sour side.', u\"Tonkatsu ramen. That pork bone broth. Cooked for at least 12 hours, rich, milky, savory. If this isn't what you experience when you have tonkatsu ramen you haven't had from the right place. Make your way to ichiran when your in New York and you will experience what the standard for tonkatsu ramen is set at. \\n\\nThe store offers standard group seating with circular tables or individual booth seating with walled divisions between seats that can be opened. Your ramen is completely customized to your tastes with richness, spiciness, doneness of the noodles, additional flavors like garlic and toppings. This is a great way to learn about yourself and figure out how you like to slurp noodles.\\n\\nMy bowl comes with a sh-medium amount of ramen. The broth is classically savory and rich. Very creamy and delicious. The hidden no tare spicy sauce is savory, complex, sweet and spicy adding depth to the ramen. It sits in the center so you can avoid mixing it in the both.\\nWe also ordered the braised pork with a small bowl of rice. It's all delicious and I set this as the standard for all tonkatsu ramen.\\n\\nDefinitely come here when your in New York. If you don't enjoy yourself then you should simply not have tonkatsu. Go have shoyu or miso. Leave tonkatsu for me.\\n\\nAtmosphere: 5/5\\nFood/drink: 5/5\\nCost: 4/5\\nService: 5/5\\nOverall: 5/5\", u\"Came here with a friend after we both agreed on this place after neither of us have been here and the hype has died down. Was anticipating on trying this place since they're popular in Japan. \\n\\nWhen we arrived, we were assigned booths 29 and 30 toward the rare of the restaurant. We were handed our ordering sheets and water as we filled out our orders. The recommended options are already circled on the sheet so it makes it easier to make your decisions if its your first time at Ichiran. \\n\\nOur dishes were prepared in about 5 minutes and we both looked forward to digging in. After finishing my whole bowl, I think the best part of the meal was the broth. I had 5 scoops of chili powder added so that made it so much better. The meat was mediocre and the noodles weren't bad. \\n\\nMy one complaint I did have was for the portion size. My friend and I both agreed that it was a bit on the small size. We literally spent 10 minutes at the venue and we were both done with our bowls. \\n\\nAlso my friend and I weren't sure if we were allowed to talk or not, but there is a collapsible compartment that you can fold in between booths to converse with one another.  \\n\\nOverall, I thought this place was overhyped. I probably would not be back.\", u'I finally got to try Ichiran.   We first went to another ramen shop Dashi, but were told that they sold out of ramen during their soft opening.   When we got to Ichiran, there was no line.   We immediately got seated.  You would be given a number, and upon entering the dining area, you could look for the stall with the corresponding number. There are dividers that separate the stalls, but the dividers could be opened up, so even if you are going there with another person, you can easily remove the dividers and create a private space for the two of you.  Look for the sign that says \"handbag\" under the table, that\\'s where the hook is for you to put aside your belongings.  \\n\\nOrdering is simple, you just go through each line on the menu, and select the quantity/strength you need.  Drinks are at the bottom of the menu.  I would recommend getting their sake and then a cup of hot tea for after you finish your ramen (to help digest the food).  Once you are done marking your order, you just press the button to the top right hand corner of your table.  A server will come and retrieve your order form.   \\n\\nOnce my ramen arrives, I was immediately drawn by the thickness of the broth.  The flavor was rich and the soup caressed and coated every strand of the noodle.  And the noodles basically serve as delivery pipes and bring to your mouth the delicious flavor of the broth.  The noodles were cooked to your selected liking, I usually like mine medium firm.   The best part of the noodles was their in-house spicy sauce, I regret ordering my noodles mild.  I was craving for more of the spicy sauce.   Their cha-shu (sliced pork) meat was good also.  My friend highly recommended their Tonkotsu egg, but I didn\\'t find that special.   It was a very satisfying meal with the portion, I didn\\'t have room to get extra noodles (kae-dama) or dessert.  I really like the hot tea that I ordered, it\\'s an original blended tea by Ichiran.  \\n\\nOnce you are done with your meal, just press the button at the top right hand corner to get the check, and you will pay at the cashier on your way out.   Ichiran is a non-tipping restaurant; however, you do pay a premium for the quality, etc.   Our meal for 2 people came to about $94 with 2 orders of sake, 1 hot tea, 2 eggs, 1 extra chashu and 2 bowls of ramen.  \\n\\nOverall, I would recommend this ramen place to ramen lovers.  It\\'s a famous ramen shop from Japan after all.  If you are new to the place, just follow the recommendations on the menu, and you can\\'t go wrong with that.', u'Ichiban is a Japanese ramen restaurant that is part of a chain. I know most people are skeptical of chain restaurants but don\\'t let that deter you. This restaurant is a part of a chain from Japan itself. It specializes in tonkotsu ramen, a pork broth that takes hours upon hours to achieve its depth and richness. I honestly am still thinking about my first bowl of tonkotsu ramen from Saturday when my husband and I were there. That\\'s how good is was. It was worth the three and half hour drive from Boston to New York. I hope one day they will open one in Boston. Until then, I can only contemplate of that delicious rich pork bone broth. \\n\\nLocation wise, I think for New York, they could have picked a better place with more foot traffic. Driving through the area, you see stretches of factory and warehouses, buildings with tin roofs. There is very little foot traffic. I saw one person walking during our many twist and turns while driving. There is a small park nearby which is adjacent to what I believe are housing complex. By all means, I would not take public transportation here and walk the streets. When we were there on a Saturday, there were plenty of street parking on both side of the street so I recommend driving if you can or taking the taxi. We were there during their less busy hour, around 2:00. \\n\\nIt was a 15 minutes wait for three booths next to each other. It would have been 20 minutes for four the waiter said. My son didn\\'t need his own booth since he was not eating. Bad idea. My poor husband did not get to enjoy his bowl of ramen because babysitting a four year old is a monumental task. There is dimly lit waiting room with several tables where you can sit and decide what you want to order before you are actually seated which is cool because you can begin ordering the moment you are seated. It was by all means, spacious and very comfortable. I thought the red lanterns that adorn the ceiling were a nice touch. \\n\\nIt was the faster 15 minutes and when we were all seated in a \"flavor concentration booth\" and at each booth there was a pen and wooden chopsticks with the menu printed on the the chopstick wrapping. So don\\'t be quick to discard it just yet in case you may want to order refills or additional items. \\n\\nI recommend for the first time, going with the recommended set if you are unsure of what your personal preference is. But if you are an experienced ramen eater, by all means, select the level of spiciness and ramen texture you want. I added a picture of my order slip if you like a rich broth, medium firm noodle, and a more spicy broth. I picked level 5, which I think is just the right amount for myself and helps cuts the rich broth. Definitely taste the broth first before you do anything. What I did with my small mound of spicy chili was slowly work it into the broth as I ate rather than mix everything at once. That way I was able to control the level of spice. It became spicer as I reached the bottom of my bowl. \\n\\nFor sides, I recommend the seasoned egg. It is hard boiled. It is recommended that you eat it first before your ramen arrives but by all mean, eat it however you like. Add it to your ramen or eat it as a side. The egg was well seasoned. \\n\\nWe also ordered sides of wood ear mushrooms. This add a crunchiness to your ramen. This should be added as a topping to your ramen when your ramen arrives. We ordered the sliced pork. It was fatty and juicy. \\n\\nFor dessert I ordered the almond matcha pudding. You are given a small tin plate if you ordered dessert. When I was ready for my dessert, all I had to do was place it on top of a sensor. It took less than a minute to arrive. I would describe it as a firm pudding texture. It comes with a sweet matcha sauce that you top the dessert with. The dessert isn\\'t too sweet so the sweet sauce gives you that extra level of sweetness that you may desire if you have a sweet tooth. It\\'s very smooth and you can taste the hint of matcha and almond extract. \\n\\nBeverage are rather expensive. My husband ordered a matcha beer which was about $10 and he said he could have done without it. I ordered the matcha green tea, hot. It came with sugar and milk. I went without either of the two. Hot tea also help cut the fatty broth. \\n\\nOverall, service was great. The wait was short, the food came quickly, within 5-10 minutes. The rich broth and ability to customize your bowl of ramen was worth the trip. Total cost of our meal was $88 which is a bit steep but well worth the experience. You can really do without the beer and wood ear mushrooms and matcha dessert so you can still get a decent meal for a good price. But if you are traveling from out of state, I recommend you spend the extra amount to get a full experience. It is well worth it. Also, this is a no tipping establishment which again, justify the slightly higher price. I definitely would recommend this place. See my pics.', u\"I'm so in love. Ichiran changed my life when I had it in Japan and I've had the chance of visiting NY recently. The location is far from a lot of main attractions and most people who arrived have luggages (and took taxis). They give you a tag and can check your big luggage which was nice. \\n\\nI came around 2pm on a weekday and it was near empty. I sat at the individual booth and it transported me back to Japan. I was bummed about the hard boiled egg but i was prepared so I wasn't too disappointed as I really miss the ramen itself. \\n\\nI would say it's 90% close to the japans one. The broth is insanely rich and flavorful. The noodles are coated with the rich broth and you can't stop slurping. I chose the richest flavor and chose the most garlic. Def go richer if you can. I also ordered extra noodles as well. \\n\\nYes price is expensive, near $20 for a bowl of ramen but tip is included. You go for the brand and to save a trip to Japan. \\n\\nI also ordered the box of ramen to go, around $40 so it's def not cheap. However, ITS ICHIRAN. \\n\\nEnough said, I'm here for another couple of days and am already planning a trip back here.\", u\"Before I had Ichiran in Japan, I was under the impression I wasn't a huge fan of ramen and even disliked it when I stayed in Austin. But now, I can't even remember how it exactly was when I had it in Japan but in New York, it was good just not mind blowing. \\n\\nWe had a pretty big group so we decided not to sit in those booths for the full experience. I'm generally not for those type of things, but if you are then you definitely should try it out and they can even remove the slots between booths so you can talk to the person you're next to (if needed). The ramen itself is really expensive, I guess because it's NY but overpriced in general. The soup base was pretty good but my friend's described it as a better quality ramen (from the packets lol). I got spicy level 6 which was a good kick and circled medium I think on everything else. One thing I really like is their chashu and the texture of it. I enjoyed this meal but for the price, I would rather wait and go back to Japan and have multiple meals there as there is decent ramen for cheaper elsewhere.\\n\\nService was good as our waiter was very attentive and helpful. This would not be a top pick for me to go back to, but if you haven't tried it and not a ramen fan, you may want to try this place as it may change your perspective on ramen. \\n\\nOh, and also their egg is different from the regular egg that goes with ramen! I actually enjoy theirs better as I enjoy my egg cooked thoroughly but it's all preference.\", u\"I'm not a ramen fan, but after trying this place I AM HOOKED! When I heard about Ichiran, I wasn't all that interested because it's ramen but after hearing EVERYONE rave about it in Japan, I knew I had to check it out when I was visiting NYC! \\n\\nWait: I went twice, one in the morning and one at night and both there was no wait! I personally can't speak much about weekends, but weekdays are generally empty!\\n\\nFood: so so soooo goooood! My first time I got everything that was recommended and additional noodles! I personally love the noodles and the broth. Noodles are cooked to perfection and the broth is the perfect amount of sodium! \\n\\nPrice: for a standard bowl of ramen without additional add on is about $18.90 without tax. That's pretty pricy in my opinion! I'm used to paying $10-$12 back in SF. But since I was on vacation, I thought why not? Definitely worth trying at least once! \\n\\nService: if you sit at the booths, you rarely communicate with the servers since they are behind the curtains! To get their attention, all you have to do is press the button and give them the handwritten menu! \\n\\nOverall, a m a z i n g ramen joint! I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone! Hands down my favorite!\", u\"Came here on a Sunday afternoon but there was still a 15 mins wait, which wasn't long at all. I ordered a tonkastu ramen with firm noodles, medium richness, level 4 spiciness and a tonkastu hard boiled egg. I love how their ramen is customizable to your own liking. Their broth was rich, flavorful and aromatic I couldn't stop slurping the soup. Their chasu and the egg was seasoned so well, although it's a hard boiled egg it was still very delicious. My only complaint was I wished they could give you more noodles Cus I finished it within a few bites. Although I feel like this place is a ripe off I still think it was worth the price because it as that good.\", u\"Ichiran! \\n\\nThank you for your hospitality.  Ichiran is a Japanese noodle house located in Brooklyn New York.  They serve really good hangover cures.  You're seated at your own private booths, the layout made me feel like I was about to take an exam lol.\\n\\nI do have celiac disease which prevents me from enjoying gluten.  The staff here did their best to help me decide on something I could have.  I opted for the soup without the noodles, and I added the yummy mushrooms and a bowl of rice to my order.  The broth is delish.  Salty, flavorful, and the bowls they serve them in keep the soup hot longer.  The hot sauce is yummy!  Don't be afraid to get a full spoonful of spice added to your broth, it enhance the flavor!\\n\\nMy two complaints:\\n\\n1.  I couldn't have the noodles but they still charged me for them!  They charged me for the extra mushrooms and rice.  Like really?  It's not fair for me to pay the same price for a regular bowl when the main ingredient is absent.\\n\\n2.  There were no gluten free noodles available!  I understand that udon and ramen noodles always have wheat.  However, having some spare rice noodles on hand for those with dietary restrictions would be a great substitution.  \\n\\nThe items on the menu are very to the point and there is little room for flexibility.  I would recommend Ichiran to those in need of something hot and satisfying on a rainy day.  For those who can enjoy the noodles, they look pretty darn amazing.\\n\\nIf you're in the area, stop in and check them out.\", u\"Ichiran place is certainly on the pricier side of ramen but tip is included! I absolutely enjoy their individual seating. It's awesome to go with friends or solo! I rather not compare to Japan - this is NYC. You can't find the same service and flavoring elsewhere. The very first time I went, which was a year ago, the line was superrr long. Since then, i've been back twice and each time was just as good as the last. I enjoy being able to customize my flavoring and the spice content. \\n\\nI have tried most of their items on their menu - ramen, matcha beer, matcha tofu pudding, the egg, and the extra kaedama - all very satisfying (maybe not the matcha beer, that was too new for me to embrace entirely)! I'd come back again during a cool winter day to enjoy a nice bowl of ramen.\", u\"Fell in love with Ichiran on a trip to Japan. It definitely ranked in our top 5 bowls, so we were super excited when it opened here in NY. Given that getting from Park Slope to Bushwick via public transportation takes roughly as long as getting from Brooklyn to Tokyo, we waited for a rainy day when the lines were likely to be short and when we actually had a vehicle to transport us to a little pocket of Tokyo. We arrived just after 11am on a Sunday and there were plenty of bar seats available (out of 16, they were about have full). No tables in sight, so either they don't offer table seating at lunch or that section no longer exists.\\n\\nHeaven. I'm in heaven. I love Ichiran because it's totally customizable, and this one really, really lived up to the original, even down to the subpar pork that is a complete throwaway (don't bother to order extra cause it's totally lame, as is the egg). You are really here for the incredibly strong, rich broth (get it strong and rich people - that is how you want this one...not the super rich, just rich and strong dashi) and the perfectly cooked noodles (firm). A little garlic, some spice if you like. Bam. Flavor bomb that will make your heart sing.\\n\\nLooking forward to future expansion when Ichiran takes over the planet or at least co-opts a spot that isn't impossible to get to from other parts of Brooklyn. Yes, it's a helluva lot more expensive than Ichiran in Tokyo. Sure beats buying a plane ticket to Japan, though, and it really is the real deal. If you want to know what ramen is like in Japan, skip the week kneed, mildly flavored, insipid but cheap bowls you find in so many other places. This one is worth the pilgrimage and the price.\", u\"Ok, WOW!!!!\\n\\nI have been looking forward to this place for almost a year since I heard about the origin and the concept.  \\n\\nI'm not by any means a Ramen expert but to me these were heaven.  Having the control over every part of the dish was such a great way to create exactly what you wanted.  For example, I'm a slow eater and I hate soggy noodles.  I ordered mine slightly under cooked and it was FANTASTIC!!!  I ordered extra garlic, extra spice etc!!\\n\\nI tried Ippudo as well, and for me this place takes the cake.  just wish they had more drink offerings.  The green beer was not so my cup of tea.\", u\"You definitely come here for the experience of ordering and eating in a booth similar to what you would experience in Japan:\\n\\nYou sit in a booth. You choose how you want to customize your ramen via a sheet.  Then you put it on the call button. They guy behind the curtain will take your slip and minutes later your ramen will arrive and your curtain will come down. When you are done, press the call button to ask for the check and you take the check to pay in the front. \\n\\nI like that you can customize the ramen to your preferences. The broth is rich and flavorful. I love that I can get my noodles soft. The pork was okay. I don't feel like it was as tender and flavorful as I've had at other ramen places. The egg is meh. I wish it was soft boiled instead of hard boiled. They recommend you eat the egg first to act as a palette cleanser but I prefer my eggs runny. \\n\\nIt was an interesting experience but I don't think it's worth the effort to go all the way out there for ramen. I recommend going to a neighborhood ramen spot instead because the difference is the experience.\", u\"The noodles and broth are absolutely amazing! Hands down the best that I've had. The broth especially is truly memorable - be sure to taste it before mixing in the spicy sauce! If you're a diehard spice-lover, don't be afraid to choose level 10. The egg is truly disappointing however. It was acceptable, but considering how amazing the noodles and broth are, I think it's reasonable to expect above average hard boiled eggs. The matcha dessert was also delicious, but certainly not worth $10... \\n\\nThe biggest issue I had was the outrageous prices. $3 for an average egg? ~$30 for a bowl of ramen? That's absolutely unwarranted. However, given how delicious the ramen is, would I fork over the money again? Maybe. I definitely think it's worth it to try once just for the unique Japanese experience of eating here.\", u\"I opted to go here alone and take full advantage of the solo booth, and it was actually pretty fun. They certainly know how to spin an otherwise lonely dining experience into a celebration of food.\\n\\nI got 6x the spicy red powder, and I recommend trying at least 4x if you opt for medium salsa or a dash of hot sauce on your eggs. It really just enhances the flavor of everything, and it was only punishing when I got to the end of the broth where a lot of the powder had resided. I was definitely red in the face when I paid the check.\\n\\nAll in all, the ramen was great, and I'll definitely go back for it, but the experience of not interacting with anyone, even the wait staff, was the icing on the cake. Oh, and definitely get the noodle refill.\", u'RAMEN from Japan is in the states and it is in New York! The first time i came here was when i was in Japan. And from what i can say it was exactly like my experience in Japan. Loved their style of customizing your ramen noodles bowl then sitting into indivudal booths to be service your ramen. Very nice touch of the place! Broth was awesome, make sure you get the extra noodles. It is totally worth it!', u'Brings me back to Japan. I get to choose my tonkatsu ramen to my liking: simply choose the noodle texture, broth flavor intensity, oil and spiciness level, and garnish (onion) amounts. The best part about this restaurant is you could sit in single booths and eat alone without feeling the awkwardness of other people staring at you eat. Not only that, their customer service is superb which makes the travel to ICHIRAN extremely worth it!\\n\\nI have been to the Brooklyn location three times so far the food is consistent and I highly recommend it if you have not been there. They serve distilled water, not tap! Many complain about the high pricing for the ramen, however their pricing is pretty aligned with ramen restaurants in the city.\\n\\nAlso, if you have the budget and have not tried their green tea tofu, please do! You will not regret it. My friends describe it as the perfect ending to a rich meal..'], u'146.The Good Fork': [u'Ahhhh Good Fork. You never fail me. We came here tonight with friends who have never been here. We had such a wonderful time, our meal was outstanding and Maddy (sp?) was the best server, friendly and warm. Thank you!\\n\\nThere were four of us. We started with a cocktail each (martini, vodka rocks, blood orange margarita and Moscow mule). We ordered dumplings and scallion pancakes for apps (note to newbies: every time I\\'ve been here, the scallion pancakes are different: different toppings, maybe seasonal? But every time, delicious). \\n\\nWe ordered a delicious Cabernet Sauvignon (Castellare): ripe with berries. Sounds sweet, but trust me, very good. We all said \"Wow\" after first sip. \\n\\nOur meals: Pappardelle with lamb ragu; Duck (special) with OUTSTANDING \"forbidden rice\" mmmmm ginger and some other secret ingredients; Pork Chop (grits!); and I think I had the best: Trout with cabbage, radishes, avocado crema. The skin on that trout was perfectly crispy and brought back memories of fishing with my brother (& then grilling up our catch). I looked around and saw other diners discarding their skins on the edges of their plates (egads!!). They didn\\'t know what they were missing! \\n\\nDesserts and coffees: Flourless Chocolate Cake, Lemon Poppyseed Olive Oil Cake, Steve\\'s Key Lime Pie, cappuccino, coffee. 2 Fonseca TAWNY (Maddy!) ports. \\n\\nWe had a reservation for 7:30 and left at 10. I didn\\'t expect it to be so crowded that early on a Friday but we never felt rushed or uncomfortable at all. I read these other reviews and I really don\\'t understand them. I don\\'t know what people are expecting when they go out to eat, but I\\'ve always, especially tonight, felt like I was at a friend\\'s home for a good meal. \\n\\nThank you! -- Table 12, Suzy :)', u\"Dumplings here = yes, yes, yes. Very unexpected for the area but very delicious. My husband got the bibimbap for brunch and it was so delicious. I had the simple standard breakfast and it was really good.  \\n\\nTo all the folks ripping this place apart because of the decor, yeah we get it, it's faux suede, not leather - it's not Chelsea or 5th Avenue so if you're looking for 5 star dining and atmosphere move along - but if you want tasty food in Red Hook then definitely stop in and get the dumplings + bibimbap. You won't be sorry!\", u\"Had such high expectations for this place given that it's Korean owned. If you have fried chicken on the menu, it better be really good fried chicken. Unfortunately it came undercooked, bland and literally had no flavour. Could have gone without the gochujang butter that literally just tasted like regular butter with an orange tint. The biscuit was the only flavourful thing on that plate. \\n\\nService was not impressive. At least 3 waiters came by asking us the same thing within a few min from each other. We had to wait over 40min to get our food and had not ordered any drinks. The restaurant wasn't even that busy. Will not be coming back.\", u\"Came for brunch with my husband and brother recently on our way to ikea and fairway. Such a cute restaurant with a cozy home vibe. The service was very good and everything we ordered was good. I had the bibimbop - I don't eat steak so I told them I didn't want this and they offered to make it with tofu which was very nice and the dish came out great with the tofu. It's nice to go to a place that is so accommodating. We also got a bibimbop made with steak and then the 2 eggs breakfast with bacon.  Everyone liked their food and we would come back again!\", u'The atmosphere is very nice and the food is good but the quantity is a little too small.... or their plates are too big! That was so weird to see so much space on the plates!', u'Horrible place. The decor is outdated and unsanitary. There were two giant flies hovering above our table and we had to request that we were moved.\\n\\nI ordered a beer and the \"bartender/waitress\" poured it as though she had never poured a beer in her life.\\n\\nFood was not great. We had the dumpling and the mussels. They\\'re were nothing special. \\n\\nWhen we were done the waiter took my drink without asking if I was finished. All in all, this place sucks. Don\\'t go here.', u\"The pork and chive dumplings here are phenomenal. Though I might hate myself afterwards, I could probably eat 20 of them. The service is 5-star as well. Can't wait to try other dishes on the menu!\", u\"I'm glad that I read the reviews before going there for dinner lastnight! The food was delicious! Of course I had to try the dumplings amazing!!! The steak was cooked to perfection! I really enjoyed my drink it was nice and strong just the way I like my patron margarita, the bartender made it with blood orange and a sugar rim delicious!!! Overall we love this place. The ambiance was amazing!\", u'Four stars for the quality of the food and care they take preparing the dishes. You can tell that whoever owns this place is very passionate about food and loves what they do. \\n\\nWe came for breakfast a few times and it was so delicious. Yummy and satisfying! \\n\\nMy only critique would be the cleanliness. Some forks/plates were dirty and the decor seemed a bit dusty. They are also a little slow..we waited 35-40 minutes for food. \\n\\n\\nWorth the wait though, we will be back!', u'Felt rushed because they were about to close for the dinner break I guess .. the prices are a bit high for simple things like dumplings .', u\"Yelped for something near IKEA for brunch--The Good Fork sounded like a good idea with raving reviews...with a caveat.\\n\\nWe arrived on Saturday afternoon to a nearly vacant restaurant. I am aware of the outdoor seating in the back. We sat at one of the two cozy tables by the front entrance. Service could've been more attentive as other parties who arrived later than us were seated, offered water, and placed orders before us. \\n\\nPork Belly Hash $12 -My fianc\\xe9 enjoyed the hash, but was lacking pork belly. I'd say there might've been 2 pieces of sliced pork belly diced into little cubes. The pork belly consisted of mainly skin and fat. If it weren't for the two sunny side eggs, she would've been still hungry after eating the dish.\\n\\nBibimbop $16 - Portions were also small as I recall 4-5 small slices of skirt steak in the bowl. Skirt steak was flavorful, just wish there was more. The spicy gochogang sauce wasn't too spicy but was necessary to complete the bibimbop. Folks that often eat Korean authentic bibimbop will be disappointed.\\n\\nDumplings $10 - Overly cooked and nothing outstanding. The dipping sauce was very rich and overwhelmed the dumplings. At $2 a piece, the pork and chive dumplings were overpriced. These dumplings come nowhere near the $1 dumplings you get in Chinatown.  I would not recommend this dish. \\n\\nOverall just an average experience and will not be coming back when in the area.\", u'This is by far my worst food experience ever. The atmosphere is pretty nice, \"vintage\" but thats the only good thing about the place. The lemonade was nasty, tasted of seltzer water, and lemon juice. The water pitcher came and was dirty. Everything I ordered was unavailable. Frier wasn\\'t working so no fried chicken, or french fries. Asked for a burger with bacon instead. The bacon was literally raw, and the burger was just too salty. My partner asked for sausage with toast and eggs. The toast was hard and bland, and the sausage seemed boiled or cooking in dumpling juice. The sausage was undercooked as well and nasty. The biscuits on the plate were SO DRYYYY! Do not waste your time or money. Nasty.', u\"Okay taste, service, ambiance all there but very long wait for our meal and drinks were weak kinda disappointing. It's Brooklyn after all and not that fast paced urgency ya find in New York City... patience indeed!\", u\"From the moment I walked in. I knew it was going to be a great experience.\\nWhen we arrived the place was packed and it was a good sign. I and my friend were seated immediately.\\nThe food was wonderful and incredibly inventive.\\nI'm a vegetarian, so in love with ravioli, served with hot and baked with a creamy looking cheese sauce on top.\\nWe loved the ambiance, feeling homey, pretty and relaxed. Reasonably priced  with attentive service.\", u'Well, I guess it all depends what you order. Appetizers were great, all what we had: mushrooms, pancake, dumplings. But my main course was a disaster - out of five lamb ribs four were pure fat and only one had real meat on the bone, potatoes were not done as well. But I can suspect based on empty dishes of my friends that steak and chicken orders were good. Also, it would be helpful if the waiter who took drink order knew specifics of their wine selection. Maybe it was just a wrong day?!', u\"Very special place. Love the chicken, the fish specials, the burgers, and the many wonderful appetizers. Was not at all enamoured by the Red Hook Winery's Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay combo. Deminishes both varietals. There's a reason the French didn't pursue the idea.\", u\"Ok Ok this place is out of this world!!! I grew up in this neighborhood and we never had this back in my day.  They made my steak so rare that I was back at the farm!!!! If you are in Red Hook you will not be disappointed here!  The atmosphere is excellent low lighting and the drinks fahhgetaboudit they don't skimp.\", u'Food was excellent but service was negligent. We waited over an hour for our 3 entrees. It was busy but that was ridiculous. Was never asked if we wanted more drinks. Flagging down for check was also very slow. Very disappointing service.', u'My first experience here. The chef creates a refreshing fusion of Eastern and Western flavors.  The scallion jalapeno shitake pancakes, the fried artichoke appetizers, and the Steak and Egg Korean style entree were all spot on.  A fantastic combination of flavors, great cocktails, cool ambience, and super friendly staff.  Will definitely go back to explore more of the menu.', u'Been going here for 7 years now, and my man behind the bar is the best in the business. Place is great, best restaurant in Red Hook.'], u'49.The Breukelen': [u'Editing my star rating to a 5 based on the response from the owner and how this situation was handled.  \\n\\n\\nHi.  I love Breukelen.  I have been there numerous times. I would give it five starts on any other night.  But not tonight.  I live up the street.  I have lived in this neighborhood for four years. Tonight, my boyfriend went in the store late to ask for a shot.  It was late, and after he entered i noticed the door sign said closed.  (They close at midnight and it was maybe 5 to 10 minutes after). I didn\\'t go in the store with him; he spoke to a young white women behind the counter. He later told me she was polite and had no issue with him. He exited the store.  He was followed out by a tall black woman who was completely rude.  She pointed at the sign and condescendingly said, \"read this CLOSED\" as she pulled down the gate.  She said it slowly like we were stupid. I found her behavior to be rude so I said \"you don\\'t have to be rude.\" She poked her head out and said \"welcome to Brooklyn bitch\". She actually called me a bitch over this instance.  I didn\\'t even go into the store! This is not good customer service. There was no need to use that term.  It was uncalled for and we were not disruptive; we didn\\'t do any harm.  We were in the place for less than 60 seconds. \\n\\nI hope the owner talks to this woman.  I have never seen her in the store before so maybe a new hire.  But I was not rude.  I didn\\'t not deserve to be called a bitch.  I did nothing wrong except call her out on  how rude she was to us.  To respond with such hostility is unprofessional and should not be allowed in a restaurant like The Breukelen. Please speak to this woman about her rude awful behavior.  I am not a bitch.  Also I never even went into the store so her rudeness was even more uncalled for.  I have supported this store since it opened (lived up the street for 2 years and the neighborhood for 4) but will think twice about coming here in the future.', u'Went in on a Friday at 9pm. Food was cold, average, and overpriced for the  amount. They were out of two out of 6 or 8 main dishes, and all but two wines. Korean fired chicken was soggy. \\n\\nUnderstaffed, so the service suffered. Took more than 5 mins before the surly bartender acknowledged our presence. When asked what beers were on tap, she didnt speak and only pointed to the sign above her.\\n\\nBad vibes, bad service, bad food. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.', u\"The food and drinks were really good. Definitely recommend the strawberry ginger Bellini or the strawberry mojito. I enjoyed my burger~ any burger that comes with a fried egg is automatically delicious. Fries were thin and crispy. The bacon wrapped shrimps were amazing. Sad they ran out of bacon for our second order. Its a must have. \\n\\nWe came here for happy hour after work. I wasn't very impressed with the service. The bartender who was also the waiter at the time took what felt like forever to get our order or just acknowledge us when we were the only people there. Then towards the night they switch waiters and she took a bit of time getting our requests when we asked several times. The restaurant was next to a place that was smoking meat or grilling and the smell of the smoke overfilled the restaurant. At some point I felt a bit nauseous from the smell. Not sure if it's an every day thing or everyday.\\n\\nOverall, it's a really good place. Fun for a date night or happy hour. The music tho was on point if you like throw back hip hop music.\", u\"Decided to check out The Breukelen for brunch because it's around the corner from my apartment and I've had it bookmarked for a min. I ordered the Nu Breukelen cocktail and Steak & Eggs. Everything from the service to the food was phenomenal! I'll def be back. Thank you.\", u'I had amazing Dinner here yesterday. The appetizer tasty and light. As the main dish I had paella and it tasted as I had known it from  Mallorca, Spain. A lot of seefruits and just delicious. The service was friendly and very nice. Everything came fast. The restaurant itself is really nicely decorated. It has a industrial meets wood romanance going. The lighting is very flattering and the music was good. I will definitely came back and try some of the other stuff on the menu. Very much recommended!', u\"Smiles only go so far...\\nService is slower than a mule on acid. \\nWhich is a shame, as the drinks and food are mouthwatering delicious!! Our waiter seems to be the only one working.. tending bar, the door and serving.\\n\\nWe just spoke with the GM, apparently, the single Server, host and mixologist. It's his first time.. The GM apologized and I asked that the poor overwhelmed gentleman, not get reprimanded for a bad GM judgement call. \\n\\nSo, we will revisit in a month. And I will update this review then.\", u'Drinks good. Food underpar. My friend ordered Korean chicken wings, but they came out like jerk/curry wings. And flavorless with lots of sauce. The accompanying truffle mac and cheese was meh. Best thing on her plate was the kale. \\n\\nI ordered the steak, medium. It came medium well and kinda tough. Greens also meh. \\n\\nRestaurant was empty, and now we see why. \\n\\nCome for drinks and Kendrick Lamar on the speakers. Go somewhere else to eat.', u\"Little gem in Crown Heights. Their Avocado Toast is du-lish! Great coffee options. Great place to get work done or binge watch your favorite shows. Plenty of outlets for charging and free wifi. I've came back 3 days in a row now.\", u\"Update: I went back and the service was still reallllly slow. Felt invisible. And based on my last experience, we ordered the poutine for the table. Sadly, it was such a disappointment this time. It was a very large portion of fries, with a small amount of the gravy (the best part) and then covered with a lifetime supply of cheese curds. But they had all melted into one giant lump of cheese that glued everything else together. You couldn't just easily grab a fry and pull it out, it needed to be cut with a knife and eaten with a fork. With 2/3 of the fries left, it became basically inedible. Sad. Mom ordered the Caprese salad (which is NOT a caprese, make sure to read the menu details) and she said it was great. \\n\\n\\nI'm sitting here right now. Poutine is yummy, service is... sad. It's a Friday night at 9pm, and there was only one person working when I came in. She's lovely and working hard, but because she's alone the service is suffering. Walked in and waited two minutes to be acknowledged. Waited some more for her to come to table. Ordered right away, got food quickly. Ate and then sat and sat and sat and sat. Was about to walk up to the bar (she's also the bartender), when a nice gentlemen appeared out of nowhere and came to my table to help me. I'll be back, it's a good atmosphere and as I said, the food was yummy. They just might need a little more help on a Friday night.\", u\"Food's not bad. Fries are delish. Asparagus also delish. \\n\\nDid not have Sprite in stock. Only Coca-Cola. \\n\\nWine selection is limited. \\n\\nBut will go back for fries and asparagus.\", u'Update: Wing night is now on Wednesdays, and Thursday is dollar oyster night!', u\"This place is awful, second time trying it and the second time I've gotten rude behavior from the workers and awful watered down coffee. Never returning.\", u'Great service. Great food (steak... yum). Great price. Very nice addition to the neighborhood. The owner, Jason, was very friendly to me and all the patrons. Much appreciated.', u\"I've been coming here for a few months now and the service is friendly and the food is phenomenal. Great drinks, coffee. Worth a visit.\", u'It looks good from the outside.\\nThe menu is extraordinary. \\nThe people were nice though', u'Took these two beautiful queens on a date here after a daddy daughter dance. We all had a great time met the owners and their dog . Food was great and so was the cider.', u\"It's a locals spot. \\n\\nCame into the neighborhood early trying to reflect the changes happening on Franklin Ave. The food & drink menu showed this but the bar quickly changed direction, for the better, to a much more casual atmosphere with lower prices all around. \\n\\nThe service is great, the owner wonderful, the deals impressive. It's a much needed addition to the neighborhood to balance out Super Power and other niche spots which opened up afterwards. \\n\\nRecommended it to anyone looking for good food and drink, the ability to talk in a private spot, and be out on the town but not party-harty or pay over exaggerated prices.\", u\"One word to describe The Breukelen: excellence. \\n\\nA cozy, intimate atmosphere with incredible food and top-notch drinks. \\n\\nAND LET'S TALK ABOUT THURSDAY NIGHT HAPPY HOUR. Amazing wings for 50 cents, $4 beers, and $5 well drinks. They sometimes have an incredible, live band too. \\n\\nAttentive servers and bar staff, and a great vibe.\", u\"Stopped in here today for a light dinner with a friend, and we were very impressed! Expected over-priced food and a pretentious atmosphere, but the poutine on the menu convinced us to give it a try anyways. We shared the mussels and poutine and both were fabulous and appropriately priced. (approx $9 for poutine, $13 for mussels) The gravy on the poutine was delicious -- I really wish they served it as biscuits and gravy during brunch! We didn't have drinks, but I'm sure that I will be back! Great happy hour deals but seems to focus on wine and cocktails, not beer (only 4 options on tap). Service was fast and friendly, and our waitress was willing to let us sit there a while before paying the bill.\", u\"My husband and I had a great time at The Breuklen tonight! It was our first visit for dinner (we'd been during the day a year or so ago for coffee), and were impressed by the menu. We had trouble deciding because everything sounded so great, but the owner (who was making friendly rounds) helped us out. He described in detail how the options we were thinking about were prepared, and we finally made our selections: the Korean fried chicken for him, the tuna steak for me. We were both really pleased with our dishes (and enjoyed trying each other's as well...the mac that came with his chicken was fantastic!). We will definitely be back!\"], u'71.Gargiulo\\u2019s': [u'Great atmosphere in here. Very spacious and open concept. The ceilings are very high and makes for a great experience. The massive parking lot also helps so parking isnt an issue.\\n\\nThe meal was decent. The chicken parm was pretty good but the potato veggie platter that came with it was bland. They had these potato croquettes that were not pleasant. \\n\\nOverall I like the ambiance of the place made up for the slightly above avg food. I would come back to try some other items but based on the chick parm and ambiance this is a 4 star place.', u\"What a traditional Italian restaurant from back in the day!! This place was jammed packed! This restaurant was loaded with Italians in it! They have valet parking. A nice bar area. We arrived early for our reservation, and were seated immediately. \\n\\nThey had a prefix menu, and the traditional menu! We chose the traditional menu. \\n\\nI must say, the bread was AMAZING! Fresh! Toasted nicely, with awesome salted butter! Wish I could have made a meal on that!!! \\n\\nWe ordered a pan seared fresh mozzarella, with sundried tomatoes and portabello mushrooms! It was excellent. We had pan seared tuna, topped with tomatoes and onions! Soft shell crabs! They were franchese. The only thing, is they seemed to fry them first. So it was too much batter for me. But they were a nice size. 2, to the order. They have saut\\xe9ed vegetables for the table. \\nAn ol' Italian staple, a potatoe croquet!! \\n\\nService was excellent! \\nOne nice thing, the valet parking, offered to hold car, while we attended a show near by after for a 10.00 fee. Thought that was a nice gesture! Because we were wondering where we were going to park, near the boardwalk! \\n\\nIf I was in the area again, most definitely would return!\", u\"Gargiullos is pretty good. \\n\\nWe planned a surprise for my mother's 60 birthday and it was perfect for our family. The parking lot and location was great for everyone traveling in.\\n\\nWe dealt with Nino and while he wasn't the kind of guy i would guess to be on the other end of planning a party, he and his staff was very accommodating. Everyone was super nice from the maitre d' and bartender to the valet trying to keep the surprise for my mom. \\n\\nWe did the Sorrento dinner for 47 people for 4 hours on a Sunday afternoon. We used their overhead PA system with a playlist which wasn't loud enough to compete with the other parties' (communions) DJ sound systems. It was fun tho and we were able to dance and have a good time. \\n\\nI'm giving it 4 stars because the decor and food is not my favorite, but it was perfect for my family. The Italian food is typical for my taste. There wasn't much to set it apart from smaller classic Italian American restaurants in Bay Ridge / Bensonhurst I grew up with and for the price I felt like it was lacking quality, or originality and diversity. My wife got eggplant parmigiana and wasn't happy with the way it was cooked.\\n\\nNevertheless my family had a blast and had nothing but nice things to say. I would recommend having your party here.\", u\"This is my late review from 2 weeks ago. The restaurant is located in the heart of Coney Island. It's fine dining right in the middle of casual location. They have a dress code but hard to keep this up because of the location. People who go to Coney Island are definitely not going to dress up much to be by the sea and walk on the boardwalk. Proper dress code applies here such as no tank top, flip flip, beach attire, no hats, etc. So please try to be careful and respect the restaurant. We came here with Hubby's friends. His friend's wife wore shorts and I had my long pants. Good thing my top is semi dressy although it's sleeveless and hers was a bit like a tank top but had enough coverage. We were all seated at a corner table. Remember to remove your hat or cap when dining, it's the rule! Hubby and I came here for dinner once about 3-4 years ago. We remember the food was so good. However this time we tried the food and it was all right. I think Hubby and I have eaten at so many Italian restaurants so maybe we have adapted to many different levels of tastiness. If I had to rate this 1 to 10, I'd say 7, not bad. My seafood pasta was very good. I tried Hubby's chicken scarpiello. I remember how the dish was so good the first time I tried when we first came here but this time was just so so. What happened? We liked the hot antipasto that was served at the beginning. This one was great! I forgot what Hubby's friend had but his wife had a nice broccoli in garlic oil pasta and that looked super fine. Overall the dining experience was very good. Try it if you're around the area. If you visit Coney Island and want to eat here after, I suggest to women to bring a light sweater or blouse to cover yourself because it would feel awkward when everybody else dresses up. Something to consider.\", u'Came here with a large group of family one of the private rooms was booked from start to finish the service was great the food seamed like it would never end dish\\nAfter dish everything that came was amazing. The calamari was perfectly cooked the pasta had just the right amount of sauce and the bread always warm.', u\"I'm shocked this place got the reviews that it did. I could not be more disappointed in the service. The food is the same as any other mediocre Italian restaurant. 3 of the orders were forgotten had to ask twice for others. I will never come back again and I would strongly encourage other to not come either. It's Thursday night mind you the staff was by no means overwhelmed. Got offered a free beer because he forgot to bring it during my main course. So as we were about to leave he apologized and gives me one on the house. Was really excited for this.\", u'What a gem we found!!\\n\\nBeen living in South Brooklyn for over 25 years and never came across of this place! \\n\\nI can tell you, the food, the service and atmosphere is superb! \\n\\nWhy go to the City if you have the same in minutes from your home.', u\"This is a 5 star restaurant full circle, \\nGargulios was recommended to me by my Priest.\\nThere is a reason why this restaurant has been here & successful for over 100 years!\\n\\nI had my Wedding reception here, and everything went so perfect with them. I had a Big problem with my cake from a bakery in the city. (Thank God they closed!!) and Gargulios did everything to fix it and make me happy. I loved their old fashioned chairs that were in the downstairs dining room. The owner Nino made sure I got those chairs for my wedding reception. All the staff were kind & knowledgeable on everything. There was nothing they would not do to make the evening perfect!\\nI had my daughter's communion luncheon here. there were about 12/15 of us. Myself and my children are lifelong Vegetarian's and they had no problems in accommodating us on any changes and I must say with a smile as well :)\\nThe owner always comes to the tables to say hello.\\nWe have also been here several times for lunch & dinner as well.\\n\\n I Love the old world feel, & Ambiance. \\nThey have a very Large open kitchen which alone says so much about how they care about the quality of the food. The restaurant reminds me of Italy.\\nThe food is always delicious and its spotless clean everywhere. \\nMy review could go on a long time..\\nThis is a Gem of a mom & pop authentic Italian restaurant..\", u\"I got really excited about going to this place and aesthetically it was quite pleasing the service is the only reason I'm giving them two stars but the food was plain Jane disgusting I don't even want to get into detail about it everything is just disgusting I've been to pizzerias that have better quality Italian food then this place. First and last time.\", u\"We arrived and the valet instantly took the car, and wished us a nice evening, and that it was!\\n\\nWhen we walked in, we were offered a table right by the entrance, and we asked to be moved. Another table in a quiet corner was ready in barely 5 minutes.\\n\\nThe waiters and bus boys are absolutely top notch. They were very attentive of the details (water, allergies, bread, special requests).\\n\\nBut what won us over was the food...We had the rack of lamb and the steak pizzaiola. Prepared absolutely beautifully. The presentation was impeccable. The food didn't take too long, but wasn't rushed: timing-wise perfect. The meat itself was to die for. The marinara sauce on the steak pizzaiola was exquisite, and the rack of lamb was the most tender piece of meat I ever ate, it practically slid off the bone. The homemade canoli felt like a million bucks, and the espresso was the best I ever had. \\n\\nAbsolutely coming back. I'd give Gargiulo's 10/5 stars if I could.\", u\"We had a very early dinner at Gargiulos and I can tell you that the service by Angelo was very enjoyable, fast, and humorous.  He has a great personality and you feel like you have known him for years. The appetizers were great, baked clams and a Ceasar salad,but the dinners were even better. My wife had the 3lb. lobster, broiled,that she described as  to be very juicy, and tender, grilled to perfection! I had my favorite, Chicken Scarpariello on the bone with sausage, potatoes, cherry peppers. All I can say is My complements to the chef. For desert try the Tiramisu, it's fantastic. My wife was never a fan of the dessert, but today she couldn't put her fork down. Maybe next time she'll order her own and leave mine alone! Job well done!\", u'We had a wonderful experience. We felt like Nino cooked a special meal for us in his dining room. He spent a lot of time with these crazy women from New York City. Jerry was so nice and put up with us. We will definitely go back. The food was outstanding and the service  was incredible. They never rushed us out.  What a great way to spend an afternoon.  Rosa Wanda Marilyn Bobbie Rosie and Penny. Get ready for our next visit!!!', u\"Located on a bustling corner about a block from Nathan's Famous Hotdogs in Coney Island is this multi-generational Italian gem.  The walls are lined with pictures of years gone past showing the fantastic history that has taken place in and around these walls.  Upon walking in you are greeted with the grandest of rooms that has a definite art deco feel.  The food was old school red sauce Italian done right.  We enjoyed the soft shelled crabs as it was the end of summer and the season only lasts so long.  It was nice that they offered to prepare them 3 ways, options are always good.  We also had the braised lamb shank and this was a real show stopper.  Tender and absolutely delicious.  The apps were good but not memorable.  Service was very prompt and welcoming.  Overall Gargiulo's is a real winner although Coney Island is not Park Avenue this place oozes history and great times.\", u\"Nice service at the bar. However,  my food was awful. My pasta was supposed to be artichoke with prosciutto.  There wasn't a scrap of prosciuotto in it and the manager was telling me that there was. My friend had to ask for ice 5 times before she  received it. I will not be going back. Unfortunately I've been here before and had good meals.\", u\"Went for lunch with family I wasn't impressed with our food choice. Veal cutlets were thick &\\nChewy. Chicken with mushrooms were over cooked. Nothing like the good old days!\", u'What a great \"old\" style Italian restaurant in the heart of Coney Island. Service is superb, food is excellent. & there is a parking lot across the street. We ordered  Fettuccini Alfredo which was excellent and the Italian standard Chicken Parmigiana with spaghetti, which was prepared exactly the way I wanted it. Finished the meal with Espresso and a delicious piece of Italian Cheesecake. It was a perfect meal.', u\"Dude this place is awesome. I know it's a catering place but I had my junior prom here ten years ago and also my Valentine's Day date here. The food is good but the place itself is so so so nice. I did not think I would find a place like this is Coney Island. Calamari was fried perfectly there was barely any grease on it somehow. The zuppa di pesce was delicious. The lamb chops were good but could use more seasoning.\", u\"Delicious food, and quick and courteous service. We dined outside because we were too underdressed for inside. It's a very nice place inside but the music outside was enjoyable.\", u\"This is what I call old fashion grandmom's cooking. \\n    Let me start with the valet. Polite men who ask how is your day so far? Enjoy your dinner.\\n     Walk into the actual restaurant and the foyer/bar area reminded me of a Hotel (in a good way). Walk up steps and greeted by the hostess who had our table ready. Let me say this any where you sit in this restaurant is a great view. Angelo was our waiter, made me feel like I was a frequent patron. Who I believe was the owners came to our table to see if we were happy with our waiter, the service as well as the food. My husband and I were driving through New York were more than satisfied and will be definite frequent patrons.\", u\"Very good seafood with nice ambiance. I've had the stuffed shrimp, grilled calamari oregenata,  filet of sole, delicious baked clams, seafood misto marinara, and they are all excellent. The top notch wait staff serves you like a king and makes you feel completely at home. If you want fantastic food and amazing service, then you must try this Brooklyn landmark.\"], u'164.Milk & Honey Cafe': [u'Easy five stars. Here for brunch this morning and it is amazing food!! \\nYou do NOT have table service: you order at the counter and they bring your food to you after. Great coffee!!

He said it was amazing. \\nAlso I had a lemonade. And it was freshly made just for me it tasted awesome.\\nWhen I'm in the area I'll be stopping in again ...\\nAlso it was super cheap for the freshness and quality $13 for the sandwich and fresh lemonade!!\\nThat's pretty sweet!\", u'Let me start by saying this place is conveniently located right across the school building I work at, therefore it makes it a go to spot for me.\\n\\nLucky enough, it\\'s a great little place. A bit hipster (high socks in flats,big clear glasses, and sleeve tattoos type of hipster) rustic, and small. A very cozy place to grab a bite or sip some coffee. They have around 15 tables, all wooden and perfect for that \"instagram worthy\" picture. 4 long tables that will fit multiple people and a couple of 2 seaters. During the summer or warmer days they keep their window doors open so that the summer air can get in (which I love because it\\'s as if you are eating outdoors) they also have outdoor seating. The drink menu is pure art! It is written in black paint on the white tile, and there are also little designs throughout a coffee painting on the brick and a milk and honey chalk like effect on the black wall. I so much appreciate art work in coffee spots.\\n\\nThe staff is ridiculously friendly and I\\'ve never had a rude encounter here, they are always smiling and helpful. Especially David and Raphael, always looking to make your experience pleasurable. \\nMost of the time I\\'ll stick with their homemade lemonade or ginger peach / green iced teas...otherwise (being that I come here every day) my whole paycheck would end up being spent here alone.\\n\\nI\\'ve tried their matcha latte, which in my opinion was just a tad bit strong for my liking, however some may like it that way. And a favorite of mine, during the colder days is their golden milk, which is made with turmeric, and it\\'s so delicious and just a touch sweet. Their golden turmeric latte has espresso added to it, which I wasn\\'t such a fan of.\\n\\nThey have a bakery section where they sell morning treats such as cheese pastries or ham and cheese croissants, as well as pistachio, almond, butter or multigrain croissants. They occasionally have brownies and buttercream or marshmallow stuffed cookies.\\nThe ham and cheese croissant is to die for.\\n\\nAs for their menu food, I\\'ve gotten 2 soups, a lobster bisque and a shrimp and corn chowder. Neither were amazing, I probably wouldn\\'t order them again, but they weren\\'t bad. They just lacked flavor, salt pepper and spice.\\nI\\'ve also gotten one of their 3 \"healthy grain bowls\"\\nI ordered \"bowl from heaven\" which had red quinoa and Farro, avocado, butternut squash, wilted kale, soft eggs, black beans and saut\\xe9ed mushrooms drizzled with a housemate roasted garlic tahini. This was SOOO good! I would definitely recommend it as well as order it again, but I also want to try their many other delicious sounding options. \\n\\nIf you happen to be in the area this is a place you\\'d definitely want to stop by.', u\"When you enter Milk & Honey you wait on line to order and then (hopefully) snag a table. They give you a number card so your food can be brought to your table. The cafe has a coffee-shop feel with its big tables and open-windows coziness. \\n\\nI split a pistachio croissant, peanut butter cookie, Mexican fiesta (eggs, avocado, bacon, black beans, and jalapeno), and a haloumi eggs benedict sandwich. The croissant was the perfect amount of flaky, sticky, and sweet. The cookie was soft, but I would've liked it to have a non-peanut butter topping to avoid an overly strong pb flavor. The Mexican fiesta was hearty and the wrap held everything together without ingredients falling out. The benedict had a great rustic bread, poached eggs and fried haloumi. The flavors were great but I felt that there were too many sauces which took away from the ingredients underneath.\", u\"So we walked into the place and the first thing I noticed was the openness and the windows.  I know it probably sounds strange but I love a place that feels very open, has huge beautiful windows and has a lot of light coming in.  Milk and Honey Cafe, is one of those places that is small but gives the impression of spaciousness due to ample lighting and airflow. \\n \\nHere, seating is first come first serve and you order your food then take a seat and wait.  Initially Umut (my boyfriend) and I sat outside because it was the only available seat, but a table opened up on the inside, so we moved.  \\n \\nWe were given a number and once the food was ready, our number was called.  Umut ordered us lemonades which you can see us enjoying in the photos! \\n\\nWhen the food arrived I was not surprised with how beautiful it looked, this is one of the things I've heard about Milk and Honey Cafe.\\n\\nI ordered the Smashed Avocado Toast with cherry tomatoes, feta cheese, fresh mint, sunflower seeds, sprinkled with chili flakes and olive oil, served on multi-grain bread; with a poached egg! \\n \\nIt was so delicious, I never thought about sunflower seeds on something like this but it paired really well!\\n\\nI was a happy #foodie\", u\"Great place for breakfast and brunch. Great background music. Love their interior design. Great atmosphere. Great place to hang out or chill with group of friends. Great place to do some studying for students.\\n\\nThis cafe/coffee house is near my house and about 5 - 10 min walk. Took my ex-girlfriend here for brunch and it was delicious. Once walked in you basically seat yourself. Well, you can say it is first come, first serve seat. Then you go up to the counter to order what you want and when you ordered they will hand you your order number. I ordered the Egg Royal with a Mocha Latte and she got the Chicken, Oyster Mushroom & Fennel Flatbread with a Green Tea Latte. The food is served by their server and the drinks they'll call it out and you will have to go grab it. The food and the presentation were stunningly beautiful. Seasoning and the portion was on point. Nothing can go wrong.\\n\\nThey also have outdoor seating only in the warm weather. Winter and rainy weather they only have indoor seating which is limited.\", u\"We were looking for anyplace in the area that was open for dinner between 4 and 5:00 because a lot of the restaurants stop serving food in that hour, and it came down to just a couple of options, but I'm glad this was one of them. The menu was overchoice but I finally selected the grilled halloumi with salmon, my bf had the steak sandwich, and my sister had the egg dish with dukkah (Egyptian spices). Everyone LOVED their meal, and we are a group of picky eaters! We each had ingredients in our meals that we had never heard of before and we were all so enamored that we started researching our dishes online.\\nI only wish it had been a cold day so I could have tried the dirty chai latte!\", u'Such a cute place w nice decors and has outdoor seatings.\\n\\nU order ur food, pay and seat urself. They will call u to pick up the drinks at the counter and will bring ur food to ur table.\\n\\n Not sure if the place is regularly like this but when we were there, it took a VERY long time for our food to come. We saw tables leaving and nobody cleaned the tables. Dirty napkins were flying all over the floor.. even a plastic bag..\\n\\nThey were backed up in dishes. We saw the waiter \"quickly wash\" utensils for us before bringin our dish and it was dirty still. We told him and he replaced it with the new set of utensils that just came up from the dish washing staff.\\n\\nHe took away some empty plates nxt to us and didnt even bother grabbin the dirty napkins.. so of course it was flying past our way..\\n\\nThe food, was very bland. Need lots of flavoring but we were so annoyed that the food took so long, service was not up to par and we were in a rush so we didn\\'t bother complainin. The tumeric latte was very bold in flavor, think curry. Not a drink everyone can handle. It wasnt for me.\\n\\nWont be visiting again. Disappointment.', u\"Food is great. I love going there for brunch. The watermelon mint drink is delicious. The people are nice. Good ambience, good choice of music. It's Apple Pay ready.\", u\"This is a local cafe and you can bring your four legged friend when weather is nice as they have outdoor seating. I came here for brunch and it was pretty packed. It's not a standard brunch spot where you're led to a table. Here you find an available seat and line up to order what you want. Afterward you are given a number to place on your table and when the food is ready, it will be taken over to you. That's why it's important to place the number sign where it's visible. I had the watermelon mint drink and eggs royal. The drink was very refreshing and the food was delicious! My only complaint is the dish portion which is small. I left feeling a little hungry but another order would've been too much. \\n\\nGreat brunch spot and I would definitely come back. Next time, I plan to order 3 entrees to share between me and a friend.\", u'Good breakfast food, very good coffee and lattes. This is a pay first type of a restaurant. You order and pay the at register and get a number. Seating is where ever there is room. We were eating by the bar table, not very comfortable and the eggs are served in the cast iron skillet that is very hot with no cover on the handle. Careful not to get burned, I did.  \\nOverall good place.', u\"WOW - I didn't have much expectation for a local brunch spot in Brooklyn but this place BLEW ME AWAY!  I came by on a Sunday around 1:00 PM and it was pretty packed.\\n\\nThis was the ordering process:\\n1. Line up by the counter.\\n2. Once you get closer to the counter, an employee will ask you how many people you have in your party then give you a number and that number indicates where your party will SIT.\\n3. Place your order and the cashier will give you another number that will let the servers know where to place your food.\\n\\nMy friend and I ordered the following:\\n\\nVanilla Chai Latte & Matcha Latte:  VERY VERY tasty!!!  The matcha latte was so rich in green tea flavor that it caught my by surprise - definitely enjoyed it, not to mention the cups were huge!\\n\\nCreme Brulee French Toast ($8.00): if you have a sweet tooth, I would totally recommend this!  It is very very sweet.... in a good way though!  The french toast was DRENCHED in creme brulee.\\n\\nThree Eggs in Hell ($11:00): this dish was THE BOMB.  From presentation to taste... everything was on point and PERFECT!  It comes with eggs, tomatoes, bread, some basil and other sauces in a pan.  Everything was such a great blend of flavors!\\n\\nOverall, I had a great experience at.  The service and good was great.  The only thing I have to complain about is the lack of space to put our coats down during the winter time.  They have high seats with no back support and no hooks around the tables either... so it does get a bit uncomfortable to eat.  But overall, I will definitely be back again!\", u'Came here for brunch, very good food, really nothing to complain about, waitress were very nice and helpful.', u\"I love this place!  Love the atmosphere, food, the menu and service.  Too bad I don't in NYC.  I would definitely recommend this place and will go back if ever I was in Brooklyn.\", u\"This has to be one of the cutest cafes I've been to!! Everything about this place, from the ambience to the food, is just perfect. The workers are friendly, service was quick, food was delicious, price was decent, there were lots of seating and it was easy to find parking around the area. I would definitely recommend this place to catch up with friends, have a date, or even come study. When the weather is nice, they have all the doors/windows open so you'll be able to have some food and enjoy the sun. They also have a no laptop/tablet policy on weekends since they do get busy. When you arrive, you should grab a menu and order your food. They will give you a number and bring the food to you when it's ready.\\nI got the creme brulee french toast ($8) which I believe they only offer on the weekends? It was pretty good except some parts of the toast was a bit too salty for me but it did go okay with the sweetness of the dish from the fruits and syrup. I also had the grilled flank steak panini ($10) which was really good! The tenderness and juiciness of the thinly sliced steak slices with baby arugula, caramelized onions, Swiss cheese and Harissa sauce went so well with the sourdough bread. I'm so glad I found this hidden gem and I can't wait until the next time I come back to try other things on the menu!\\n\\nP.S. this place is very instagram worthy for those instagramers out there\", u\"This is a great local brunch spot... everything is made from high quality ingredients. They have a nice assortment of pastries, breakfast and lunch items.  Their coffee, ice tea and other drinks are also impressive. The staff is super friendly. \\n\\nI have been here several times and usually opt for one of their sandwiches/wraps. Today I had the chicken avocado wrap, with a salad on the side. It was the perfect light, yet filling lunch. The sauce in the wrap was yummy. \\n\\nI recommend grabbing a seat as you walk in... I have not had issues with seating, but that's probably because I have not gone there during peak summer months. Also, food is brought to the table relatively quick.\", u'This is my new favorite spot. Loved the decor, music and my meal.\\n\\nOrdered the Creme Br\\xfbl\\xe9e French Toast. Comes with a savory mouth full of flavor. The French Toast came drenched in syrup, sliced bananas, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries and drizzled nuts. Not too sweet, never soggy nor pasty. It was perfect. \\n\\nThe size feeds one but you can definitely share between two people. \\n\\nMy brunch date had the breakfast tacos. Comes soft corn tortillas, scrambled egged with Pico de Gallo and the watermelon-mint cooler. The whole meal was amazing. \\n\\nThis is a very relaxing spot, lots of natural sunlight light, outdoor seating options. Good vibes all around. Will revisit soon. \\n\\nNote to computer users: The only outlets happen to be on the right when you first walk in below forest of plants. #GreenLife', u\"Everyone has their one brunch place - the place they go after a long Saturday night out, the place they take their sister, the place they go to catch up on work. Milk & Honey is my absolute favorite brunch place; I've eaten here on New Year's Day, on lazy summer Sundays, on many last days before leaving New York. \\n\\nI always get either the Egyptian Poached Eggs or the Smoked Salmon Eggs. Honestly, any combination of their runny yolks, sourdough bread, avocado or salmon is fantastic. Get yourself a nice cup of cold brew, or watermelon lemonade if it's the summer. \\n\\nMilk & Honey has a quiet, homey, and comfortable atmosphere, perfect for brunch-the-next-day chatter, or reading a book with a latte, or typing away at your computer. There is a lush green plant wall, and the decor is all dark wood and rustic chic.\", u'Wow this place is amazing. Though there really is no service and it is self service it is truly amazing. I had the salmon corn fritters it was so so fresh! The corn fritters were a taste of heaven. They topped it with a ranch like dressing that enhanced all flavors. The latte was great though I think it could be a bit warmer. The watermelon mint cooler is so refreshing, like your eating a piece of watermelon. This place gets a four for  amazing food! It could even be a five if the servers  bringing your food would be a little more attentive especially if u want an extra napkin or water. The fact that it is a table war because there never is enough space to eat, makes it a four. Besides that it is amazing !', u\"What a wonderful place to do brunch! After weeks of planning to visit but constantly oversleeping on the weekends, I made it for a Sunday brunch with a friend.\\n\\nInside it looked a bit hipsterish, broken down, and that's what made it great. I was really feeling the look of the place.\\n\\nI peaked at everyone else's plates and they looked gorgeous! I kind of wanted a bit of everything. My friend ordered the French toast creme brulee with eggs and bacon. I'm not much of a sweets person for breakfast so I got the breakfast platter. We couldn't resist ordering a flatbread (our neighbors one had our mouths watering). To drink we ordered a Dirty Chai and Caramel Cappuccino.\\n\\nI kind of wish there was table service, the person who took my order told me my drink would be ready soon by the counter. I ended up taking someone else's cappuccino without realizing. They were nice about it though and said I could keep it.\\n\\nNow for the food.  The presentation was just awesome. The bacon cooked to perfection, eggs were great, toast was good. I had some gripes with the Sausage. It was waay too salty. The flatbread kind of disappointed me too. I ordered the chicken flatbread, I felt that it had an odd taste to it and the onions were a bit too thick. Next time I'm going to go with the pesto.\\n\\nI can't wait to come back and try more of the menu.\"], u'117.Hollow Nickel': [u'This bar is amazing! Bartender Jamie is super friendly and happy. WAY better than the salty experience we had down the street at Robert Bar.\\n\\nBut seriously Jamie is super amazing and should be here every night. SUCH a great face for this business.', u'buffalo wrap was good. I like how they put the whole wrap on the flat top to heat it. It gives it a crunchy exterior. The breaded chicken is cooked well. I would say the flavor is pretty good. I though there were too many raw onions but that is just for my taste.\\n\\nThe bar area is cool with a little bit of a hipster feel to it. \\n\\nThere is a small kitchen so it is very cool that they can pump out decent food.  Cool place.', u\"Was going to see Iron Maiden on a Saturday and we decided on going to this place for food and drinks beforehand. We luckily got a seat inside. They have several choices in beer aside from the usual beer choices, not vast, but I'm sure everyone can find something they'd like.\\nAs for the food, took slightly long to come out, but it was worth it. The burger is above average in my opinion, and their fries were very good; so good we ordered a second order. My gf got a buffalo wrap, which was good, but for some reason, had cucumber in it. Other than that, it had good flavor.\\nAtmosphere that day was a bunch of metal heads, but I'd return as i like the divey look. Also has a backyard.\", u\"We happened to be driving down Atlantic ave one night and we saw this local bar. It looked nice kind of like a comfy sports bar from the outside so we pulled over & went in for a beer. \\nIt's a nice space and I can see myself having a good time here, however when we were there, there was a really loud hipster chic loudly discussing some music album with the bartender. Energy here was a bit bougie and hipsterish. We drank 1/4 of our beers and just left.. \\nBeer selection was really small. (Also they don't carry Heineken) and the draft picks we got sucked.. menu didn't seem so appealing either.. \\nMaybe we'll be back to give it another try in the summer since they have an outdoor area.\", u\"Great place to grab a drink and some bar food.  It gets pretty full at random times but I've never had a problem getting a seat/service. They have good happy hour deals and shot deals (beer and a shot, pickleback shot deal, etc.) and a great selection of whiskey.  The bar food here is pretty satisfying, and I sometimes find myself craving the chicken fingers.  If it's a warm day, you should definitely check out the backyard!\", u'After watching WWE in Barclays center we wanna to seat somewhere and found this place which was open late night.. Bar attendant was funny guy\\nSo sadly kitchen was closed but they have snacks', u'Love this bar! My husband and I go all the time. Fried pickles are addictive and we also love the crunchy fried chicken tenders. $7 margs are solid and love the other cocktails too. Saying love a lot, but I mean it. Go here!', u\"This is a review for food only! In short, food took too long to come out (almost 40 minutes for 3 plates) and food did not taste good.\\n\\nCame here right after a Nets game to grab a quick bite. But little did we know our quick bite was gonna last over an hour. Got here around 1015pm with 2 other ppl. We ordered quickly at the bar, 2 (cooked medium) burgers with fries, and a shepherds pie.\\n\\nThen we waited, and waited and waited. 30 minutes in, we asked the bartender where our food was, and he's like it's coming out. 10 minutes later (past 11pm already!) the 2 burgers come out and they were definitely NOT cooked medium. Both burgers were too done, and the outside of the meat was all burnt. It was so dry and we were not happy with the burgers, but we were hungry and it was getting late, so we ate it anyway. Fries were overly salty. \\n\\nMy shepherd's pie came several minutes after the burgers. I've never really ordered shepherd's pie before so I don't really have anything to compare it to, but it was not good. Basically it was mashed potatoes with ground up slurry of meat. The taste was just alright. \\n\\nFyi, think there was only 1 cook in the kitchen so that's probably why it took so long, but nonetheless, I'm still giving it a 1 star review cuz I had a 1 star experience regardless of the conditions.\", u\"This place was a great addition to the neighborhood.\\nThis place has so many good things to offer.\\n\\nthe food was good with great and reasonable price\\n\\nservice was outstanding, nice and friendly.\\n\\ngreat drinks and great ambiance, wasn't too crowded.\\n\\nwonderful backyard\\n\\nEach experience has definitely been a good one.\\nFully recommended.\", u'Let me start out by saying that I am a regular patron of this bar. My friend Annie and I go there once or twice a week. What keeps us coming back is the great bar food... mainly the wings! The cook Eddie does a great job and whenever he is there we know that we are going to have a tasty  meal. He also makes an amazing burger and will customize a healthy grilled chicken wrap any way you like it! As long as he is the cook there, we will be loyal customers. The bartender Mark is also super kind and attentive. Hollow Nickel will thrive having these guys around. I am taking off one star because of the inconsistency in the quality of the food when Eddie isnt there. He really is quite talented in the kitchen.', u'Amber, who runs the show, is really awesome, she let me even use the remote! Really rad outdoor space too and the crowd was all very cool.', u\"This place was listed as allowing dogs. They don't. Management: please correct your listing.\", u'Really enjoyed Hollow Nickel! Came after work with 3 coworkers to grab some food and drinks. The happy hour is great, we all partook in the $6 sangria special. The sangria was delicious!\\n\\nFor food I ordered the BLT as well as frickles for the table. The frickles were sooo good - not too greasy and really crisp. Just wish the order were a little bigger, or the price tag a little lower. It seemed expensive for the roughly 10 frickles that actually come in the order. My BLT was great too, nice sized portion and fresh tasting ingredients. \\n\\nOverall, Hollow Nickel is a really cute spot with a solid happy hour. I recommend it and if in the area again would definitely return!', u\"This place was great! I stopped here before a show at Barclays.\\n\\nThe setting is pretty intimate - I wish I lived closer to this place. \\n\\nI had the BLT and the fried pickles. Both were really good - I would definitely order them again! \\n\\nNext time I'm at Barclays I'll definitely stop by this place.\", u\"Stumbled into Hollow Nickel on a rainy Sunday when we were in need of shelter from the rain.\\n\\nFood is about three stars, but the service pushes Hollow Nickel to four stars.\\n\\nThe ordering (at least on a Sunday) is DIY, but we didn't mind with Abbey's friendly demeanor. :)\\n\\nProtips:\\n$6 Pickle back shots\\n$7 beers on tap\\n\\nGood rock and roll tunes as well.\\n\\nThanks for the great service, Abbey. We enjoyed staying dry with you!\", u\"Great neighborhood spot. Indoors and outdoors both good spaces. Love a place where you're equally fine getting a nice meal or a Narragansett tallboy.\", u\"Came here for some beers and an early dinner with some girlfriends during happy hour. Tried the grilled cheese and chicken tenders. My friends had the quesadilla and blt. Portions were great for the prices. Really no complaints. They have a backyard that's a pretty nice spot to just have some drinks with friends.\", u'I came here with a group of eight people before a concert down at the Barclays Center.  We made it in time for happy hour and were able to find seating out back under the string lights at a longer picnic table.  I would recommend this place for a happy hour or their $12 burger and a beer special.  \\n\\nA lucky find for a pre-concert pregame.', u'The Hollow Nickel is a wonderful neighborhood bar. Great space for parties, awesome backyard, sick ass deep fryer, and super friendly bar staff. \\n\\nI\\'ve been here a million times and it\\'s seriously better every time but I\\'m writing today specifically because they just came up with something that is going to be the next hot thing in Brooklyn. It\\'s called a \"Gravyback\" and it is a shot of rye followed by a shot of magnificent thick-ass turkey gravy, made especially for thanksgiving. This is the kind of dope shit that goes down at the Nickel.\\n\\nP.S. Great hook up bar', u\"Well... we tried valiantly to eat here on a Thursday night. After settling in at a table and realizing no one was coming, my date went up and thought he grabbed the attention of one of the staff. After waiting a while longer and still nothing, I went up to the bar. Even though I made eye contact with one of the staff and told him we'd like menus, he never came back. Too bad... menu looked great online and we were really eager to try.\"], u'86.Blessings Cafe': [u\"Blessings cafe is a real gem that popped up in Flatbush relatively recently. I heard about it through a friend who recommended it for brunch, but now they also have a dinner menu. Ironically, both times I've been there, I've come for dessert, which they don't readily advertise on their menu, but they have upon request! \\n\\nAt first I was disappointed to hear that they only had pies. However, I took them up on their offer and boy am I glad I did! So far I've gotten the pecan pie (one of my all time favorites) and also the lemon pie (it was all they had left at the time). First off, they gave a very large slice of pie for $6 a piece. It was probably the size of two normal sized slices. The pecan pie was classic and went great with their rich coffee. What I wasn't expecting was how good the lemon pie was! The lemon custard was light and creamy with just the right balance of tart and sweet. It came in a thin, buttery crust and completely satisfied my sweet craving. \\n\\nNext time, i will be back to try their dinner options! Also of note - they have an outdoor patio in the back that's quite lovely. If you find yourself looking for a restaurant in Flatbush, give this place a try!\", u'Overall, I have mixed feelings about this place and would probably rate it a 3.5/5.\\n\\nI came here for brunch and the food was absolutely delicious. I decided to go with the \"Montrealer\" which is a breakfast croissant sandwich with bacon, mustard, maple, an egg with your style choice (I got mine sunny side up), and hash browns on the side. I would highly recommend everyone to try it at least once. All the ingredients complement each other very well.\\n\\nNow for what made me give this place a subpar review was due to the atmosphere. Upon arrival, you\\'ll see that there are pitchers of water already on each table. I would\\'ve preferred if the water was served after the customer arrives. Not only would this be more sanitary (there were no lids on the water pitchers), but it would prevent the ice from melting before the guests arrive. Also, I came on a warm day and could barely feel the air conditioning. There were a few acs, none of which were very strong. The front and back doors were open as well, which invited the hot summer heat to come inside the restaurant.\\n\\nOverall, the prices were reasonable and the food was really good. I would come back again if I\\'m in the neighborhood and the weather is cooler.\\n\\nPS - The restroom had a broken light when I went and I was only able to see because of the slight sunlight shining in through the window. I\\'m really curious how the evening guests will be able to see, perhaps a candle is set up? Either way, I surely hope the light situation is fixed now!', u\"I've only ever been here for brunch and have enjoyed every meal I've had here. I'm curious about their dinner menu and wonder if the servings and pricing compares to the brunch menu. \\n\\nThe service is always great. I love their herbal teas. The live jazz band can be too loud at times if you're sitting near the front.\", u'Wouldnt brunch ANYWHERE else on my birthday!!!! Blessings is bar none my favorite. I cant order mimosas anywhere else tjats how hood they are. I love the staff, they made my food taste even better which i didnt think was possible.', u'Hospitality galore. As soon as me and my little man walked in, we were greeted before we took our next breath. Waiting time was less than a second; we were seated right away. My son wanted plain pancakes and orange juice (it\\'s not on the menu as plain but you can request it) and I ordered the sweet potato and broccoli rabe frittata with cappuccino. The staff was very accommodating and so, so, so friendly. \\n\\nThe wait for food was a tiny bit long but when our plates came out, the food was fresh and delicious. The frittata look like a mini sweet potato pie with the salad decorated on top with lime alolit.  My son got three pancakes with syrup, blueberry puree and chocolate chips on the side. He was like \"Whoa!!! This is so big!\" Lol.\\n\\nThe waitresses always checked on us to make sure we were good especially since my son can be picky. They are very child-friendly.\\n\\nThey do have outdoor seating in the back; I guess that\\'s for the summer season.', u\"I like this little cafe, they made the most of the intimate space however I was not wowed to go beyond three stars. The portions are pretty big and they like to serve big hunks of bread. Ahhhh my weakness *salivates* bread. My olive toast was toasted too hard for me to enjoy it fully. The blueberry pancakes are drowned in a pleasing blueberry compote and unsweetened yogurt. It's a communal feel here and you would feel comfortable visiting alone with your book or computer.\", u\"It's a no for me dawg. I enjoyed sitting at a table next to a large open door / window area but the food and drinks were rather basic. The chicken Milanese was (well cooked) breaded chicken with dry arugula on top. There was no butter lemon garlic flavoring to be found until I asked for it. The aperol spritz and the brooklyn tasted like lightly flavored sparking water. The only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the decor and the friendly service.\", u'this place is amazing. Be sure to try the salmon pastrami on Olive toast..... it will change your life.', u\"We went here two days in a row at the request of my boyfriend - but we both had the same exact meals both times because the pickings are kind of slim for the brunch menu.\\n\\nBoth times we had to wait a bit (the space is pretty tight, the outside area was closed and it's very popular on the weekends), like maybe 15 - 20 minutes. On the upside the server was nice and the atmosphere is comfortable - I think there was live music on one of the days we went.\\n\\nI removed a star because they do not cater to people with certain dietary needs. Instead I was told to order something else instead of modifying a dish.\", u'I visited Blessings on a Sunday morning -- this place was popping!!! I was a little surprised because it\\'s not in your typical \"Brooklyn\" area. As unhipster as the surrounding area is -- this place was great! I\\'m from buffalo, ny so $4 for my macchiato seemed like a BIT much but when in Brooklyn, am I right? \\n\\nThe baristas were very friendly despite the mad rush of people. And it didn\\'t bother me to wait at the bar for my drink. While we were there Sunday brunch was going on. This was a bit distracting because the place was legitimately JAM packed. I mean barely a foot of space for anyone to walk.\\n\\nI was originally going to give 4 stars because of the live band that was playing -- who isn\\'t impressed with a live band? Then I remembered that it was super crowded and barely any space. \\n\\nOverall, 3 stars. Great macchiato but extremely expensive. Good location but super packed. You could find a better coffee shop.', u\"I grew up on Flatbush... This place is what I think of when I think of 2017 Brooklyn... Take that how you want to take it... \\n\\nThe food is great, they had live music. The smaller the party the better as there's limited space. \\n\\nGreat for brunch dates where you are too in love with each other to overhear or be bothered by typical millennial conversations, ha!\", u\"Nice hipster cafe. I went here with my dad for dinner last night because we wanted something close by and healthy. I got the red snapper on fennel and my dad got the steak frites with salad instead of fries. We also ordered the salted caramel apple pie and the chocolate pecan pie for dessert. \\n\\nMy portion of snapper and fennel was pretty small for $18 I thought. It was really good though! I just wish they had put more grapes on it. There were only like 4 grape halves - not enough for all the snapper. The fennel was also delicious. \\n\\nThe steak was delicious too, but the salad wasn't very good. We didn't finish it. I think it was just arugula with a light dressing. I didn't like it. \\n\\nThe pies were both delicious! Service was good too.\", u\"The cutest breakfast spot in Flatbush! Okay, so I was only in Brooklyn upwards of 10 hours but I for one can't imagine anything better, and we haven't even gotten to the food! \\n\\nSpace is fairly limited but on a Monday morning, we snagged a spot by the window. Ok, ok, let's get to the good stuff, let's talk brunch. Bae and I split the Montrealer and yogurt with granola! Everything was great but the croissant sandwich was borderline out of this world. The sides of greens and home fries were just as appreciated as the sandwich! This girl loves some crispy home fries and these were awesome! \\n\\nSo moral of the story? Check it out!\", u'I went here for brunch during a business trip. When I say it was packed, \"it was packed!\". The locals love this place and I can see why. Excellent customer service, fun environment, GREAT FOOD!!!.\\nAndrew@ the bar \"master mixologist\" made up drinks as you enjoyed your meal and they were all delicious.\\nI will definitely visit again.', u'Love the atmosphere where you sit at the counter enjoying breakfast and jazz! Foods are fast and their tomato soup is great.', u'This place is such a cute caf\\xe9! Being in close proximity to my house I was hoping that it will be my regular spot. We came here on a Saturday afternoon and had to wait a little bit, but were seated at the bar within 10 minutes. Unfortunately after my experience, I probably won\\'t give it another try.\\n\\nAs a frequent restaurant goer, the ultimate test of quality breakfast food (to me) is determined on whether or not I will get my eggs properly cooked - whether that is poached or over-easy. A lot of restaurants do not pay attention to that and I sometimes get very runny whites which practically ruins breakfast for me. \\n\\nI understand that it was a very busy Saturday brunch, but the waiter behind the counter didnt even ask once if everything was ok - meanwhile my bf sat there with an extremely disgusting blob of uncooked egg on top of his croissant and bacon. \\n\\nWe ordered the \"Montrealer\" - a breakfast sandwich with one egg any style over maple smoked bacon and cheese on a croissant. It came with a side of home-fries and arugula salad. The home-fries are shredded potato, cooked very crispy. My bf liked his but I thought mine were too greasy. Both of our over easy eggs were undercooked but his much more than mine. He ended up simply taking it off the croissant. The only thing we genuinely enjoyed was the Bloody Mary. \\n\\nThe place itself is very crowded and there are no hooks at the bar. I sat with my jacket, scarf and bag on my lap.', u\"A blessed Sunday at blessings cafe. Blessings cafe is a cozy and rustic cafe in Prospect Lefferts gardens. After arriving early in the am we were seated close to the open kitchen which was quaintly located at the back of the cafe. I ordered a chai latte and my friend got a got chocolate. I must say I have had many chai lattes and this one by far was the best hot one I've had. They put so much nice and creamy foam on top of it. We ordered pancakes and I had a veggie scramble. The food was good and exceptionally fresh. I always when I eat out and the vegetables taste straight off the farm. It's definitely a place I would come back to especially since I live in the neighborhood...\", u'Avocado sandwich! The bread is toasted with olive oil and served with egg! Not too heavy and not too light :)', u'Owners stroller in the walk way had to squeeze by ordered $8 of coffee went to sit outside LIKE THE SIGN OUTFRONT SAYS and was told we couldnt by the owner because we werent having brunch....', u'Great neighborhood spot.  Especially now that the kitchen is open for dinner.\\n\\nThis is one of those places where the food is good and the staff makes you feel at home.'], u'113.Project Cozy': [u'A very \"cozy\" area to hang out with friends or work/study in lower Manhattan. The roomy cafe has a variety of coffees, smoothies and pastries. I\\'ve tried their famous Mint Coffee and AffoGOTTI, and they were both AH-MAZ-ING. \\n\\nI took a quick detour during my lunch break to try project cozy\\'s mint coffee, and it was nothing like what I\\'ve ever tried before. It was the perfect combination of caffeine, sweet, and minty freshness. \\n\\nThe AffoGOTTI was honestly mind blowing. A shot of La Colombe espresso shot poured over a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a hint of chocolate chips and nuts. I don\\'t know where to start. It was everything I\\'d hoped for and more. If you love ice cream and you\\'re a caffeine junkie like me, this is the perfect order for you! \\n\\nI can\\'t wait to come back to try their mint chocolate macaroons, earl grey cream puffs, and smoothies!', u\"This is a nice place to grab a coffee with a friend or two but definitely not with a big group. Most of the tables here are small and comfortably seats two and there is a couch in the back of the store but it seems to be always occupied. \\n\\nGood location to get some work done but again it might not be as convenient for a group of people since most of the tables  are small. There are outlets around the store and free wifi and you need a code to access the restroom. \\n\\nI'm a huge fan of coffees and teas, so of course I had to try both. I got the green iced tea and it tasted very light and plain, they definitely need to steep the teas longer so it's bolder in taste and has more fragrance to it. The coffee was alright just like many other average coffee shops. I also got the chocolate chip cookie which costed $5, though it tasty but it fell apart easily making a mess on me. \\n\\nThe staffs here are friendly and accommodating and that's always a plus.\", u\"Great place to hang out with friends or to do work at (if you don't require good internet or even any internet). The internet was horrible when I went, it barely worked. Maybe it was just that particular day that the internet was bad but from other reviews, it seems like it's bad often. I wouldn't recommend this cafe to study as the tables are small and the music is loud. The tables would probably only fit your laptop and that's about it. With the amount of space this cafe has, the space could've been used wiser. \\n\\nI got their lychee matcha drink which was pretty good and refreshing. The drink took rather long to get and I also thought it was pretty unorganized. Some drinks were handed to customers at the cashier where customers were ordering, some were handed at the designated spot to get your drinks. It got pretty confusing to me, especially since the cashier didn't ask for my name so I didn't know which drink was mine. After about... 8-10 minutes? I finally got my drink. \\n\\nThis place is full of instagram worthy opportunities. It's a very 'hype beast' place. They also have pastries from bibble and sip which is pretty cool.\\nMy friend tried their black sesame croissant and said that it was really good.\\n\\nOverall, really wanted to like this place but kind of disappointed. I don't care much for coffee so drinks like lychee matcha and juices at a cafe were a perfect combo for me. Where else can you find a cafe that sells fresh juices??\\nI really wanted this place to be my designated cafe but from the slow service to the small tables and bad wifi, I don't think I will be back often.\", u'From the signage outside is a Instagram worthy photo to the moment you walk in with current music trend vibes to the workers greeting you as you walk in all we\\'re off to a great start. We had a group walk in as we were all visiting from Las Vegas and wasn\\'t sure what items on the menu were best, so we then asked the worker what his opinion on a few items. I then proceeded to try \"More Life\" & let me tell you from the moment I took the first sip. It was the total appropriate name for it! It was the perfect blend of the right fruits were it wasn\\'t too sweet or bitter. \\n\\nThe ambiance and total vibe was perfect and could imagine having meetings or getting work done since it\\'s a big enough space to do either or! Must come through!', u\"This place overall is a 3.5 for me and this is how I I broke it down.  I ordered: earl grey cream puff, cozy mint cream puff, cold brew, and the feel like Pablo juice.  I would give the food and drinks 4 stars because I've tried the bibble and sips cream puff before and love the earl grey, but I'm not a big fan of the cozy mint.  However, that is a personal preference. The drinks were okay. The juice is about $8 a cup.  The feel like Pablo was refreshing.  \\n\\nThe service and atmosphere I would give 3 stars. I had to repeat my order 3 times and each time something was wrong. From the amount of cream buff, the type and the drink.  It can be due to the the loud music.  I saw a lot of people studying here and certain seats did look cozy, but this wouldn't be a place I would come to study.  The tables are really small and the music are loud so people have to speak a lot louder to hear each other so it's difficult to concentrate.\", u'Been here 2x in the past two months. Found out about this place from Instagram. My main reason for coming here is the Bibble & Sip cream puffs that they sell here. I\\'m a fan of the actual Bibble & Sip place, but that\\'s in Times Square area which I tend to avoid whenever possible. \\n\\nI\\'ve tried the exclusive \"Cozy Mint\" cream puff here as well as the Matcha one. I\\'ve had both Matcha and Earl Grey at Bibble & Sip in the past, and the matcha one remains my favorite. Note that once they sell out, there\\'s no more for the rest of the day since they\\'re not made in-house at Project Cozy. $4.50 each.\\n\\nAs far as drinks, I\\'ve tried the special \"Cozy Mint Coffee\" here. Very minty indeed, but on the watery side. Didn\\'t really taste much coffee. Disappointment. If I\\'d known I was paying $4.50 for minty water, I would have just gotten another cream puff. They also took 15+ minutes to make my friend\\'s \"More Life\" juice. Get a stamp card if you order drinks (free drinks after 10th one). I heard they\\'ve added new drinks to their menu since, so maybe those may be more worth it...\\n\\nMain issue with this cafe are the tiny tables. One laptop alone takes up most of the table space, leaving little space for your drink and/or pastry let alone anything else. Doesn\\'t make sense to me how two chairs are then placed with one of those tables, since it\\'d be even more difficult for two people with laptops to work comfortably. \\n\\nThis place is huge. Very spacious. I like the color aesthetics. I\\'ve seen people taking pictures under the neon lit sign and am guilty of taking a photo of it too. Space can be utilized and filled better to actually make this cafe \"cozy as fck.\"\\n\\nIf you\\'re trying to study or get work done here, the WiFi isn\\'t the best. My friend had to turn on the hotspot on her mobile device since the WiFi was too slow. It works, but takes forever to load. Employees are friendly enough - ask one of them for the WiFi password or bathroom code if you need it.\\n\\nOverall, I wouldn\\'t recommend this place to study (at least not unless they do something about the tables). Good for hanging out and grabbing Bibble & Sip cream puffs otherwise.', u\"The mint coffee definitely drew me to this place. While I lived in San Francisco, I loved the mint mojito coffee from Philz and definitely missed it here. But enter Project Cozy! The coffee is awesome, with a subtle mint flavor. It definitely reminds me of the one from Philz. Service was prompt and the space is really nice. I'd love to come back to chill here and try some of the delicious pastries!\", u\"When I found out that they serve bibble and sip pastries, it was my first stop before heading to work.\\nI tried the cozy mint coffee and it taste great! I forgot to add sugar at the condiment table and when I took a sip, it wasn't too bad. Usually I need sugar in my coffee but I had it without sugar. I can definitely taste the hint of mint in the coffee which gave it a refreshing taste. \\nI wish they had the pastries that day because I wanted bibble and sip but I didn't wanna take the 15 minute trip to Times Square. \\nI'd definitely be back for more coffee and hopefully be able to try the cream puffs and grab myself another mint coffee!\", u'With a name like Project Cozy, I expected sheepskins and warm lighting. I would\\'ve settled for some Bon Iver on the soundtrack, at the very least. Instead, this coffee shop is sleek and industrial, with concrete flooring, a \"cozy as fck\" neon sign, and deep teal details. The seating is Eames-chair style plastic chairs, which didn\\'t look too inviting to me. Feels more clubby than cozy.\\n\\nI came for the signature mint coffee since I was just around the corner reading at Maman (which would actually live up to this shop\\'s name). It\\'s $4.50 including tax, and the wait was quick.\\n\\nIt comes in a throwback wax-coated paper cup, loaded with ice and garnished with mint leaves. As some reviewers noted, there\\'s a thin layer of powder on the surface and the ice cubes, which was a bit of a turnoff. It\\'s not great for grab and go as it\\'s an open top.\\n\\nThe taste was pretty good; reasonably strong on the coffee, which seemed high quality. It did need some sugar, but they have simple syrup on hand, so I was fine. I didn\\'t taste too much mint, to be honest. My boyfriend liked this a lot more than I did.\\n\\nI\\'m not mad about it, but I wouldn\\'t come back.', u\"Finally, I don't have to trek all the way to midtown west to get Bibble and Sip cream puffs!! They sell them here but it's a dollar more. I came in on a Friday afternoon to do some work, but also wanted to take some cream puffs to go. I knew they would sell out, so I asked them if they can hold it for me until I leave. They had no problem doing that. \\n\\nI got the mint coffee to stay. It was a nice refreshing drink. The mint flavor isn't too strong, just a hint, and I didn't need to add sugar to it. \\n\\nThe place is very spacious with lots of seating and there is plenty of natural light. There's also free wifi that isn't slow.\\n\\nWhen I went to get my cream puffs. I was missing a mint one, but they didn't have any left. They offer me a refund, but I asked if I could take a cookie instead. The guy told me the cookie is really good and boy was he right! The chocolate chip brownie cookie was one of the best cookies I've had. It's a combination of two things I love. It was crumby and chocolatey. I'm a bit sad I didn't get to try the mint cream puff though. Oh well, there'll be a next time! I'll be back to try the mint cream puff and the sesame croissant.\", u\"Project Cozy has no affiliation with West Coast's Team Cozy, but it's just as cool.\\n\\nIt's a huge space that is perfect for tourists to rest their feet, and for locals to frequent to take advantage of air conditioning and free internet access. The tables are far apart, so you do not have to worry about people staring at your screen as you are procrastinating on Facebook. \\n\\nThey have a lot of pastries that they receive from Bibble and Sip every morning. So, expect lots of matcha, cream puffs, and specialty croissants. \\nAnd they have a great selection of healthy juices, named after song titles and artists. \\n\\nI am always searching for spacious, coffee shops that stay open late enough after work, just in case I feel ambitious that day.\", u'When New York listings describe something as \"cozy\" it translates to a space the size of a tiny closet. Project Cozy is the complete opposite. This giant cafe has natural sunlight on one side and quiet neon corner on the other. It\\'s great for both catching up with friends and getting some work done.\\n\\nThe Cozy Mint Coffee is similar to San Francisco\\'s Philz mint mojito, although less sweet (you can add more simple syrup at your discretion). The mint chocolate cream puff from Bibble & Sip is the pasty to try. The workers are friendly and the Wi-Fi is fast.', u'I have longed for the day when a version of a mint coffee drink would make its way over to NYC. Well, I\\'m happy to announce that the wait is finally over! The Cozy Mint Coffee certainly lives up to my expectations. It is creamy, minty, not overly sweet and you are still able to taste the delicious aroma of the cold brew.\\n\\nAs for the juices, I really liked the \"More Life\" (pineapple, apple, kale, celery). The \"Watermelon Drank\" is their most popular juice on the menu but it is a bit too sweet for my own personal preference. However, I was happy to find out that there is actually no sugar added to the drink.\\n\\nThis is truly a neighborhood gem! This new establishment took me by surprise with its modern and trendy decor as well as the ample amount of space available to do work or catch up with friends. I will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu and of course for more Cozy Mint Coffee.', u\"I came in here because I wanted to finally try some of bibble & sips items without having to go to midtown and I wanted a refreshing juice. All the things I ordered along with the chill setting made me give this place a 4/5. I'll explain:\\n\\nPlace - located in an area full of food and shopping, project cozy is a great stop to pick up a light snack and some refreshing drinks. Upon entering, you'll get hit with a nice crisp AC'd air. The place is spacious as can be! I'm sure if you start screaming, you'll probably hear an echo!. Very casual, very modern and very chill. \\n\\nDrinks - I ordered the Vitamin A - which is a juice that consists of carrot, orange, pineapple and ginger, which was all freshly juiced in front of me. It came out tasting great without any of the ingredients overpowering each other. \\n\\nPastries - I got the matcha & the Cozy Mint cream puffs. All the pastries are supplied by Bibble & Sip, which are known to have awesome stuff. The 2 did not disappoint. Both with a nice exterior crisp along with the inside being fluffy and the cream not crazy sweet. Yes, I agree for $4.5 each, it's kind of steep but if you've never tried it, mind as well give it a shot once. I will have to go back for the earl grey next time. \\n\\nKeep up the great job and hope to see more new things come up on the menu !\", u\"I've only been here once but it looks so darn cute! It does look quite cozy and I look the back area where the light is though I think it is a little too dim for anyone to really sit there and relax. Everything also seems very clean and aesthetically speaking--not bad. A little plain, but not bad.\\n\\nMint Coffee--it's not bad! My first time having it but it's not mind blowing. But I do like it because it's refreshing!\\n\\nAs for the cream puff--yep. Hits the spot but it is from Bibble & Sip and not one of Project Cozy originals. I like the location of where this is located and I like the fact that they have cream puffs from Bibble & Sip so you don't have to trek your way to midtown for some cream puffs.\\n\\nOverall--I would come back here but I just don't think I will come here often enough being that I'm actually slightly disappointed. I'll come back and try something else so I will definitely update my review!\", u\"Hate the music, love the food.\\n\\nThe matcha cream puffs from Bibble and Sip were great. Come early because they do run out! The juice was average, but the speed at which it was made was so slow. It took  15 minutes to make juice and there was only one person before me. For a juice thats called more life, you sure need more lives to get it. It's made of kale, apple, celery, and pineapple. I like the kick the pineapple gives. The matcha cream puff was so good. I am not a cream puff person, but I really enjoyed the bitterness sprinkled on the exterior. \\n\\nThere are a lot of tables and chairs, but they're mostly  occupied by one hipster with a mac per chair.\\n\\nWish they would fix the wobbly tables so coffee will not spill like ours did. There's  a code for the bathroom and free WiFi which also has a code.\", u\"Unsurprisingly, the highlight of my visit was the Bibble & Sip cream puff. These cream puffs have been hyped up for a while now and I finally got the chance to try them out now that they're conveniently served at Project Cozy. I ordered the Earl grey flavor since it was screaming for me as it was the last one there and seriously no regrets... There's so much delicious cream in one pastry. It's also not super sweet which made the dessert more enjoyable for me. \\n\\nI paired it with the Cozy Mint Coffee and compared to the cream puff, I'm honestly not a huge fan. I wasn't sure what to expect but the mint had a bit of a kick and I just didn't really enjoy it in my coffee. About half way, I added some simple syrup which toned the mint flavor down a bit, but still, I don't see this as something I would order again. I'll definitely come back for the cream puffs and I'll give some of their other drinks a chance as well. Plus, this place had good vibes, plentiful seating and nice staff so give this place a shot.\", u\"I really love this newly opened cafe down in lower east side. It is brightly lit and spacious, with plenty of outlets along the walls. I like that there is an assortment of seating including tables, benches, and a large booth in the back. Honestly, I think this is the quintessential millennial hang out spot, which is why it really calls out to me. It is as hip as it is classy, and I can definitely see myself spending large chunks of my afternoons there getting work done.\\n\\nTheir mint coffee is alright. I was originally super excited when I heard that an iced mint coffee had made its way to New York because I'm a huge fan of Philz mint mojito.  However, I noticed that there was a ton of weird powdery residue at the top of my cup, which makes me think that they used powdered milk for the drink. I'm not sure I would order this drink again for this particular reason. I'll wait for my annual fix back home in California.\\n\\nI'm glad that they have partnered with Bibble and Sip to offer their cream puffs on this side of Manhattan because the trek to B&S isn't always the most manageable. However, after hitting up both Project Cozy and B&S in the span of a few days, I noticed that there is a significant upcharge on the cream puffs ($3.50 vs $5.00). I did like their special mint chocolate cream puffs though, and since you can't get this anywhere else, I would definitely come back for it here. \\n\\nI believe they do offer complimentary wifi, although I didn't use it. They have one large bathroom available to customers in the back - you have to get passcode from the barista though.\", u\"I came in around 1:30 and wanted to try their Charcoal lemonade. The man said it almost ran out with a little bit left but he kindly gave it to me for free. So I brought a Matcha cream puff as well. It's $4.50 From Bibble & Sip compared to $3.75 at its original location. Overall, the vibe here is very nice and will definitely come back for the drinks.\", u\"Broome Street is now the only place to open if you're a trendy new coffee shop: Project Cozy just joined Cha Cha Matcha, Happy Bones and Greecologies.\\n\\nThe space is huge, with a neon sign and everything. Most importantly, they have pastries from the excellent Bibble & Sip.\\n\\nThey also have a signature Cozy Mint Coffee ($4.50), which will remind you of the famous drink from Philz Coffee from the west coast.\\n\\nDefinitely get the pastries, especially the custom new cream puff from Bibble & Sip.\"], u'55.Red Hook Lobster Pound': [u\"BuzzFeed helped navigate several of my dining choices during my trip to the Big Apple, and my favorite was Red Hook Lobster Pound. Definitely off the beaten path, RHLP was a bit of a hike since we had chosen to walk it. But is was so worth it!!\\n\\nWe were very lucky to get sat as quickly as we did since we were only a party of two. The people right in front of us were quoted a 30 minute wait for their party of 4. \\n\\nWe were sat literally next to the food prep area, so we could see through the glass as they made the dishes.\\n\\nOur appetizer of crab dip was phenomenal. Our LOBSTER ROLLS WERE SO INCREDIBLE!!! I wish I had been able to eat even more!!\\n\\nI am glad I wasn't steered in the wrong direction and will definitely go back next time I'm in Brooklyn and craving lobster.\", u'Somehow paying $25 for a lobster roll is like when a crime has taken place but it\\'s one of those \"harmless\" crimes like shoplifting. No one gets hurt but it\\'s still wrong, still feels dirty and cops are still called to the scene of the crime. \\n\\nMaybe that\\'s the price we all have to pay for lobster rolls now even if it\\'s served in Red Hook Brooklyn. Maybe this is the new lobster roll normal. \\nMaybe I\\'ll avoid lobster rolls for a while. \\n\\nBtw, this is a $$$ place not $$.', u\"We had an hour to kill before a concert around the corner, so we decided to finally try the Red Hook Lobster Pound.\\n\\nIt was a Thursday night and the dining room was almost completely empty. It seemed like there were 3-4 front of house staff on the floor, but it took them a long time to acknowledge and seat us. This seemed to be the theme the night (not just for us).\\n\\nWe ordered the new england clam chowder, fish and chips, and classic lobster roll. The clam chowder was probably my favorite, standing out against other clam chowders I've had before. The fish and chips were well seasoned, although the breading was a bit salty for the SO's taste (and he loves salt). The fries were cooked perfectly. The lobster roll was a decent sized portion, they definitely did not skimp on the lobster, which I appreciate. The sweet potato fries were cooked well, but needed salt. In general, their portions are decent and worth the price.\\n\\nI really wish I could give half stars, but I'll round up to be fair. Maybe it was a fluke but overall, I was unimpressed due to the slow inattentive service. Whenever it takes too much effort for me to flag down a server, it cuts into my enjoyment of the meal. This is such a huge deal breaker for me. I would come back again and give them another shot with the hopes that service is better.\", u'Since opening, we\\'ve come to Brooklyn, either to catch up with errands or shop at IKEA. And always made sure, to grab Lobster Rolls to take home (most times, they didn\\'t even last the long trip home) or have dinner here- because we knew they were just that good.\\n\\nSat at the Bar on our most recent visit and went for a \\'Fall Sangria\" that was highly recommended and tasted nothing of what people might associate Fall with: the Cinnamons, maybe nutmeg or something with a \\'warm\\' hint. Zero. I drank the thing anyway. \\n\\nWent with Lobster Cheese Fries and got real excited just thinking about that triple play: Fries+Melty Cheese+Lobster= I\\'m All Over It! But it didn\\'t impress me at all: bunch of fries, really good cheese that melted fine. Lobster? Puh-lease. Those fries were a joke- ate all the cheese and left behind flat pieces of lobster the size of my pinky nail. What a freaking tease, man. \\n\\nOf course, Red Hook\\'s Lobster (Buttered) Rolls have always been their showstopper. But I\\'m sad to say, not even those tasted good. Lobster was very chunky with awesome lumps-but were tasteless. But I get it...things don\\'t always remain the same- things change, the way in which people prep these Lobsters have changed and I\\'m almost second-guessing Red Hook\\'s, \"straight from Maine\" Seafood quality.\\n\\nDespite of it all, I\\'m not dismissing Red Hook just...... yet. I think there\\'s some potential still and somewhat looking forward to a next visit.', u\"Hadn't been here in a while but it did not disappoint.  We snagged an outside table on the way back from the beach and I ordered the lobster roll (I think the Connecticut one?) with potato salad.  The potato salad was a little underwhelming and left me wishing I had ordered the sweet potato fries instead :-p.  The lobster pieces were nice and meaty, always a pleasant surprise when outside the New England area. My friend ordered the crab cake sandwich and was quite happy with it. \\n\\nI ordered a lemonade which was painfully sweet so I kept diluting it with water.  Will likely skip it next time.  Looking forward to going back, hopefully this time I won't wait as long between visits!\", u'What can I say everything was on point!!!  We came for brunch on a Sunday and was not disappointed.  The place was crowded but we did not have to wait for a table. The wait staff was fun and fast!!  Also very honest and knowledgeable about the menu.  I like the honest answer not the price answer!!!\\n\\nI got the unlimited Bloody Mary with lobster claw...yesyesyes it was sooo delicious, not too thick, just the right amount of horseradish and spice very tasty!!!  I got the BLT roll for my menu the lobster was sweet and plentiful.  It came with sweet potato fires and cole slaw, it was a very delicious and filling menu.\\n\\nI will definitely be back such a good time was had by all!!!!', u\"I've heard the lore of Lobster Pound for quite a long time so it was somewhat of a relief to finally check it out. As a native New Englander, I take matters of chowder and lobster with utmost seriousness.\\n\\nI was surprised that stopping by on a Sunday evening around 7 was a dicey move - we only got a table for 4 because someone else failed to show up for a reservation. It dwindled down from there, but I will definitely be reserving in the future.\\n\\nI wanted to test my three favorite dishes to see if the reputation was really warranted - clam strips, clam chowder, and of course a classic lobster roll. The strips were a hefty serving and made a great appetizer for four. Its rare to see them seasoned with anything in the batter, so the old bay flavoring was nice and made them zesty.\\n\\nThe clam chowder was pretty great too. I always have a hard time finding good chowder in the city but this made me feel pretty close to being in Cape Cod. I'd come back again just for a bowl  (or two) of the chowder.\\n\\nAnd the lobster roll. The meat was plentiful, tasted very fresh, and overall the roll was great. I'm not sure I'd always shell out the ~$25 for a roll every time I went, but the other seafood was still more than enough reason to visit Lobster Pound over and over again. Washing it all down with a 'Gansett was the perfect end to a weekend.\", u'This eatery has been on my \"foodar\" for a while. My honey and I have been known to drive almost to Rhode Island from our NJ home for a lobster lunch. Having a good lobster place 30 miles east, well that\\'s just magic! And magic, the Red Hook Lobster Pound is. \\n\\nLocated in what used to be a pretty sketchy neighborhood, the restaurant is a colorful beauty mark on an ordinary looking street. We arrived early so we had to sit and read our emails and texts while we waited for 11:30.  We were their first customers today so the place was empty. The servers greeted us and, after asking a few questions, we ordered, what else, lobster! \\n\\nI also tried their New England clam chowder and found it remarkable. Yeah, eating anything but Manhattan chowder in NYC seems sacrilegious, but I\\'ll do my time in purgatory for this tasty dish and I\\'ll order it again and again! \\n\\nMy wife had the classic (meaning cold with mayo and scallions) lobster roll and I had the hot buttered roll. We both loved our orders, making yummy noises as we went. My wife, a fan of good potato salad, had theirs instead of fries. Thumbs up from her and that\\'s a rave. I had their fresh cut real French fries and I was glad I did. Cole slaw accompanies the lobster and it\\'s a different style - less mayo, more vinegar? In any case, it\\'s good. \\n\\nThey have \\'root\\' sodas - whatever they are - and my wife had a blueberry flavored drink that she liked but after a sip, I  passed. Instead, their lemonade was my choice and it didn\\'t taste like it came from a powdered mix. It was tart and good. Halfway through, I added tap water (from the frosty bottle offered as we were seated) and it still had a good kick. \\n\\nWe ended our meal by splitting a key lime pie (From Steve\\'s) and having just had Balthazar\\'s take, found theirs equal in every way. \\n\\nThis is a local gem. A bit out of the way for public transportation but easy parking for cars on an early weekend.\\n\\nI added photos of their menu and wine/beer list for reference. Prices reflect the quality - meaning fair...\\n\\nOur bill with a 20% gratuity was a smidge under $100. A bargain when you consider the high quality and location. \\n\\nHighly recommended for lobster fans. We\\'ll be back with friends. Hope to see you there soon.', u\"That's one damn meaty LoBSTaH Roll!\\n\\nSeriously, that was one of the most stuffed pieces of buttery soft crisp breads I have shoved into my mouth in a long time. Utterly delicious lobster, so fresh, and cooked just right. So tender and melt in your mouth at the same time. Orgasmic.\\n\\nOh yeah, start off with the yummy fried clam strips and down them with a cold craft beer from their full bar. Foreplay.\\n\\nPlenty of seating inside, patio seating on the front sidewalk, terrific service, and funky decor clean bathroom. Pure pleasure.\\n\\nA bit on the pricey side but should be expected when eating seafood of this quality. If it wasn't so much of a hike to get to from the UES I might be here more often.\\n\\nA must visit to enjoy life in all it's gluttony when in the Red Hook area.\", u\"I've only ever heard good things about this place. We finally made it out the other night to try their lobster rolls. (Please note, this review is 100% about the food and all the rave reviews I've heard. Service was in no way lacking or bad.) \\nAt $25 each, the best thing on the plate was the pickle. \\nEverything had seasoning that was WAY off. Fries had no salt- none. Lobster salad on the roll was only lobster and mayo on a bed of lettuce- badly needed paprika, celery salt, something (who puts lettuce on a lobster roll?!?!) and cole slaw got easily 10 times more black pepper than it needed. I will admit, I'm really really miffed that the lobster roll had lettuce on it, as it accounted for about 1/3 of the volume of the total roll. \\n\\nLong story short, go to Luke's. There's nothing to see here.\", u\"After my trip to IKEA, I decided to forgo the amazing meatballs served at IKEA and try Red Hook Lobster. It was a good decision as I was delighted with the service and the atmosphere plus there was no wait time. \\n\\nI started off with the cheesy lobster fries; the fries were loaded with five different cheeses and it was a melt made in heaven it needed more lobster in it ; none the less it was very good. \\n\\nMy next choice was the Caramelized lobster Brussels sprouts, the Brussels sprouts had a sweet and nice grilled taste - fantastic !!!! My final selection was The Connecticut lobster roll -all I can say is wow the bread was buttery but not soaked with butter and the lobster was coated perfectly not overwhelmed with mayo. I will be back to try the rest of the menu as I'm wide open on Red Hook Lobster .\", u'Wanted to check this place out and we were not disappointed! The food was rich and decadent. Friendly staff and really cool, laid back atmosphere. We ordered the lobster roll and lobster cheese fries (they were out of lobster Mac & Cheese). All in all a great experience. Great drinks and good music! Most definitely will be back the next time we are in town.', u\"This place is darn good. Though I have to point out the prices are too high for the frequency I wish I could consume their Lobster Rolls, especially compared to CT, RI or ME pricing.\\n\\nAnyway, I haven't had a bad item on the menu here, and I'm always happy to go. Service is friendly, fast, and the food has always been fresh and tasty.\\n\\nIt does help to get a reservation if you're going with more than 2 people for dinner because there's not a lot of seating - and they do take them unlike many trendy places in the area - so you should plan accordingly if you're not from the neighborhood... because, let's face it, Red Hook is not the easiest place to get to for most New Yorkers.\\n\\nIf you haven't had their Lobstah roll, you're missing out. Go get one warm with butter, the way it's meant to be.\", u'This is a great establishment with lots of room and lots of options! I\\'m sure that I could eat through every single menu item with much glee and satisfaction. However, just trying it for the first time, we (wife,child, me) shared the classic. \\n-Having lived in Maine, that\\'s the default for comparison. CT rolls do exist there (see Red\\'s) - also delicious. -\\nAnyway, the roll was very good. If I could change something, maybe all lobster/mayo. A little seasoning is OK, but without the lettuce. Fries were fantastic. I didn\\'t love the slaw, but my wife liked it.\\n\\nAlso, I am on the fence about the combo meal being the only way to order the roll, as opposed to just a roll. \\n\\nQualms aside, great, fresh lobster and tons of great options in a great spot. Just great.*\\n\\n\\n\\n*the overuse of the word \"great\" in no way reflect my political affiliations.', u'I am sad to leave this review because my excitement to visit this place was overwhelming.  I had a great final class at school and wanted to celebrate with two of my favorite things to do, trying something new and having fresh seafood. This location was my top choice since it was in Brooklyn, leading me to believe it was the original location. \\nThe staff was very friendly, seating us immediately allowing a choice of seats, inside or out.  the decor was cute and coastal, the vibe, laid back. Bottle of cold water on the table, with glasses, was welcomed.  I ordered a classic roll with fries, a cup of clam chowder (at the suggestion of my waiter, I didn\\'t know which to choose).  My friend got a crabcake sandwich with potato salad. The chowder was FANTASTIC!  The flavor was great, full of potatoes and tender clams, broth just the right texture, silky.  This was a great way to start a meal!  Too bad that is where it pretty much ended.\\nMy roll was s.a.d. (soggy and diminutive), and the fries were ok, but dusted in cracked black pepper.  The meat- droopy, rubbery, damp with a thin slippery substance almost at room temperature, had a \"less than fresh\" flavor, atop wilted lettuce pushing the slimy Lobster pieces upward.  The volume was laughable (less than kids scoop of ice cream,  not the 4oz it touts), obviously, since the inside of the 4\" gooey bun was sliced aiding in the meat placement to look \"full\", decorated in green onions and paprika.  Note: I am aware of the  \"-ember\" months approaching and the molting season has begun, but this was all together different in texture.  I fought through the flaccid lobster meat with a fork and knife (SHELLS in my first few bites) after attempting to lift a crisp yet soggy inner/bottom roll, simply because i was so hungry.   The coleslaw and pickle were super vinegary and acidic, not like citrus acid either.  One bite of each and it was over.  I ate the fries until they were cold and drank most of the second bottle of water to wash away the impending queasiness from the main course.\\nMy friend said her sandwich was good but much smaller than the already less than average sized bun.  Her coleslaw and potato salad were also very vinegary, which which e even more peculiar for her sides.  She ended up with a cup of that sumptuous chowder to fill her up and get her palate back on track.\\nCheck came quick without asking, I\\'m sure because obvious we were not ordering any thing else.  I doubt a return this far out of my way for a subpar meal an outstanding cup of soup without drinks and a tip for $40.  I\\'ll just get chowder by the truck if I see it.  You know,  I still tipped slightly above average(18%) due to the polite service and left much like the roll... sad.', u\"My mom and I went there for the first time for my belated birthday dinner on 9/22/17. The service was great and the food was tasty. They had a special that evening where we were able to share an appetizer, each have a soup and a lobster roll with a side. Everything was amazing and very filling. My only complaint was the close proximity of the tables as the back room had been closed for a private party. It was very busy when we arrived and throughout most of the time we were there which wasn't surprising since it seems like a neighborhood favorite. It was nothing we couldn't handle though. All in all, it was a great experience and I would definitely go back again.\", u\"I've been to Red Hook Lobster two or three times. I am always on the lookout for a good NYC lobster roll. I used to only eat them when I was in New England. It is certainly difficult to pay what I pay in NY compared to the amount of lobster you get in Maine for a fraction of the price. But I will say that up until now Red Hook Lobster Pound has my favorite NYC lobster roll. Not cheap at $25 a piece, but they have a healthy amount of big chunks of lobster. You know what you're eating. It isn't a mystery. I usually eat both styles (Connecticut and Maine). I've also had their oysters Rockefeller and they are very good too. Sit outside, have a beer and a lobster roll. Why not? If it's too hot just sit inside. ENJOY!!!\", u'I loved the food in this place, the lobster rolls live upto their reputation. I use to feel the place was a bit uppity, but this nite at least I noticed the staff is very diverse and friendly as well, which went along way to making me feel a lot more at home.', u\"It was national lobster day (unknowingly) and i tend to covet things in timely matter. Having a yen for that sweet, succulent, soft lobster i googled and researched for just the right place with the right amount of stars and reviews.After sifting through the many results, i narrowed it down to three places and tool the plunge to a place closest to home. The Red Hook Lobster Pound. Red  Hook, here i come.\\n\\nAs i approached the wonderful facade, i was greeted by a lovely host or perhaps manager. She was rearranging the front of the establishment. I showed up just as they had opened(well planned), so i was able to be seated and served without the wait (my strategy). \\n\\nA super cool server came up and offered menu and drinks, and informed us of the special beer battered lobster roll they had. I ended up going with some beer, cocktail which were generously portioned and served. \\n\\nWe ordered the main event for $75 with choice of chowder soups, appetizers and lobster rolls. I went with the new england clam chowder, hot crab dip w chips for the table and the classic lobster roll, since it was my first time. \\n\\nAfter waiting approximately 7 to 10 minutes for our soups, we were served and ready to chow down some chowdah! The chowder soups we splendid, i expected a tad bit more of that velvety creaminess taste, but it was fairly balanced so no complaints.  Afterall, i was there for the lobster roll. In any event, it was delicious. Next came the heated crab dip with chips and i must say this was DA BOMB! I definately recommend this for anyone eating here. The scrumptious lumps of crab to melt over freshly crisp baked chips and already my palate felt satiated. \\n\\nAfter all the chow and guzzle, \\nWIthout further ado,\\nOut came the classic lobster rolls.\\nChomp! munch! chew!\\n\\nIt was devour and destruction, everything you could want from a savoury, buttery, soft, delectable mouth watering lobster roll. Suoer lumpy to give you full fledge lobster taste with every bite down the layers and layers of lobster and seasoning. As full as i was, out of glutony i could have ordered more lobster rolls, but I'm on a health watch, so i managed to pull off the check and slide out of this treasure chest. \\n\\nWhen in red hook, don't get caught up with the wrong bait. Stop by Red Hook Lobster Pound!\", u\"Finally came here with my mom a few weeks ago.  The menu looked GREAT. We just wanted a snack, which is too bad bc everything sounded awesome - and very authentic.  We split a lobster roll. It was small, as usual, but tasty.  The decor was cute and service was spot on.  Only bummer was they didn't have whoopie pies!  I 100% want to come back for a proper brunch soon.\"], u'7.Taste of Heaven': [u\"With all of the chaos in the world, Taste of Heaven soothes the soul. The service was great. The cook made sure we got to sit at his usual table, the coolest spot in the restaurant. The condiment selection was on point. We got there an hour before closing, so they were out of collards, but they still had plenty of hot food to offer.\\n\\nI got the barbecue ribs, macaroni and cheese, and corn. The portions were huge. The meat slid completely off the bone; it was so tender. The hubs got the Jack Daniel's chicken, macaroni and cheese, and the rice and beans. He tried to pick up a piece of chicken, and with only the bone in hand, the meat stayed on the plate. So tender! Everything was so good. It reminded me of neighborhood cookouts in Virginia where people came to throw down. \\n\\nNote: If you were thinking of assembling chicken and waffles, the waffles are only available for breakfast which ends at 11AM.\", u\"This place is great. Honestly, its a restaurant with a bunch of guys working hard to cook good soul food, with no pretensions. They have Jerk Chicken, Jack Daniels Chicken, Turkey Wings, burgers and chicken fingers. Two sides and a meat are served hot and delicious for $12. I would definitely return to this friendly and quality take-out spot. Great for a hearty meal before a concert at Brooklyn Steel. \\n\\nThe only thing I could complain about is the mac and cheese seems to be a little bland, I think they might benefit from some added cream or garlic or something. Was tasty with the addition of some Franks' Red Hot, though.\", u\"While looking for soul food restaurants in NYC, I was surprised to see Taste of Heaven pop up on the list, and to even more delight, it was in my neighborhood.  I am quite familiar with the location and I have seen many eateries come and go, but with Taste of Heaven, we may just have a keeper!\\n\\nAs usual, I scrolled through all of the Yelp reviews just to see how good this place is.  People who love and appreciate soul food are very tough when giving their reviews: either you got it or you don't.  This is why I made the short trek up to Taste of Heaven.  Why all the glowing reviews, the food and even the services.  They never go hand in hand!  Well, I can truthfully say that both the food and staff make this place a winner.  On my first visit, I had the jerk chicken dinner.  Two large pieces of dark meat chicken, collard greens and yams.  All of this for $12.  There were plenty of items on the menu but the last good jerk chicken I had, I made it at my home!  So, to my surprise, with the very first bite, I was smiling.  Flavorful, meat falling off the bone and moist.  The sides were equally as good.  While eating inside the restaurant, which is small with small accommodating tables, I was asked by both the server and the cook to let them know what I thought of my meal!  So, as promised Taste of Heaven, here is your review.  Only an hour and 15 minutes after leaving your restaurant.  My quickest review ever after leaving a restaurant.  See you soon... and with friends!\", u'Ok so I am from the south and I have been looking for REAL soul food in nyc for a while. Harlem has cute options but I live in Bushwick so its slim pickins over here. when it said soul food i was skeptical ... \"in east williamsburg???\" i thought ... let me tell you SOMETHING ... they know EXACTLY what they are doing. A few things of note\\n1. they baked the mac and cheese .... essential litmus test as someone with alabama roots\\n2. they have sweet tea, another marker\\n3. you have to ask whats on the menu for the day ... just like a spot in the south\\n\\nthe food was AMAZING! I am normally vegan and only break a few times a year, mostly relating to food specific to my upbrining or if i\\'m in another country where it would be ridiculous/rude to ask them to not season something with animal products. I do not regret my decision\\n\\nI truly hope this business continues to thrive because this is hands down the best soul food I\\'ve had in brooklyn ... all these other places (*cough* peaches *cough*) are FAKIN THE FUNK!!! \\n\\nget with the winning team and the winning taste because Taste of Heaven is ICONIC', u\"I'm not exaggerating or typing in hyperbole when I say, the chefs could have a bad day, and the food would still be 5 Stars.  They are that much better than the rest.  Good customer service, great portions, godly food.  Taste of Heaven is the Triple G of Soul Food, but with a better resume.  One plate later and that's a K.O.\", u'This a place that has great food at the right price, and will make you feel right at home, with their warm hospitality. I got BBQ turkey wings with mac + cheese and cabbage. While I was eating, the boss of the place said to me \"I see you licking your fingers there. I know I must be doing something right.\"', u\"One of the best restaurants I've been to in recent memory. Food is phenomenal, we got the oxtail, jerk chicken, and ribs. Everything was so good you can't go wrong with your pick. Best part was the people that work here. They are so welcoming and everything feels liked it was made with love. Even at $10 a meal, you WILL leave with leftovers!\", u\"I can't say enough about the meal I just had the pleasure of eating. Sorry I would have taken a picture but it didn't stand a chance. I had the fish and chips it was slap your mama good. I got a side of mac and cheese WOW. This is a must go to place because it is just sooooo good.\", u\"The best fried shrimp and chips ever  !!!!!!! Taste something my mother would make. And don't forget to get the mac n cheese with side of strawberry kiwi  juice . I would definitely drive all the way from Long Island for this\", u\"Tucked away in a remote section of East Williamsburg you can find some of the best inexpensive soul food in Brooklyn. The platters are cheap and plentiful, the sides are delicious and the Jack Daniel spare ribs are the best I've ever eaten.\", u'Everything was insanely good.  I got the Jerk chicken, collards and yams and my son had Mac and cheese.  Everyone there was super friendly.  Definitely worth a visit or 20.', u'OMG! Food was amazing! Very flavorful and seasoned well. The staff was very friendly too. It was definitely worth the 25 minute drive!', u'Hard to find authentic soul food in NYC but this place is on point. Good prices and not pretentious as well, unlike many other spots in the area.', u'Amazing place! The food is great ~taste of heaven! Owners and staff were more than friendly with me which made the experience even better! Best ribs I had in the US!', u'This place is the place to be for soul food. If you miss a home cooked meal and long for the holidays of mamas special celebratory meals this is the place you can find it.', u\"My husband and I cannot get enough of Taste of Heaven's delicious, mouth-watering soul food. We have tried every dish at this point, and every meal has been finger-licking good! Our favorites are the jerk chicken, mac n cheese, potato salad, and string beans, but seriously, everything on the menu is incredible. (Get there early because this great food goes fast!) The owners and their employees are so sweet, amazing cooks, and always steer us right. Try one of the cakes if you have room! This wonderful spot is a much appreciated addition to the neighborhood. We will be eating there once a week from now on.\", u'This place is definitely A MUST VISIT!! Generous portions, wonderful staff and great music. RESPECT!', u\"Stumble through here by chance and was very surprised of how much I enjoyed it. The place has no menu, so I guess it varies every day. I had a large plate of the mac and cheese, collard greens and Jack Daniels ribs. It was a heaping amount of food and very good. My gf had the chicken Marsala with the same sides, also great. \\n\\nThe people couldn't be friendlier and the music was great. The Atmosphere was plain Jane, but clean. I would come back! \\n\\nThanks!\", u\"One of my favorite restaurants in NYC!!! Always fresh, and the food is SO GOOD!! I live right next door and go here all the time- always excellent service with a smile, and I feel so lucky that it's right next to me!! My go-to restaurant! Best food ever!\", u\"I had the jerk chicken, yams, rice & peas, mac n' cheese, ribs. Everything was so delicious and the ribs were definitely worth waiting for! Affordable pricing too and friendly owners.\"], u'41.Nourish': [u\"This place is so yummy if you're in the mood for authentic Thai! \\n\\nThe flavors are NOT Americanized so if you're not big on spicy foods, stay away from anything on the menu with the chili pepper symbol  !! If you love spicy foods (like I do) you will not be disappointed.\", u\"A rather unassuming spot with a great patio out back, Nourish is a great place to visit if you're in the area and looking for great, authentic Thai. The service and food were food superb and I highly recommend trying one of their specialities over the go-tos like curry and noodles. Everything was fresh and rich in flavor; honestly I couldn't find one single flaw in anything I ate. \\n\\nThe only characteristic keeping Nourish from a 5-star review is the tea. I believe my green tea cost $7, which seems way too overpriced for such an item. This especially rings true considering I was not offered any refills. If they ever knock their tea choices down a dollar or two, I think it would better suit the restaurant and the customers. \\n\\nBut, having said that, I will certainly be dropping by again--and soon.\", u\"Pretty nicely decorated restaurant. The pictures on yelp of the Thai Herbed Chicken wings actually led me to choose Nourish because it looked THAT good. It actually met my expectations too. It was marinated pretty well and the dipping sauce was perfect for it. Also, tried the Kee Mao with chicken and the pad thai chicken. The kee mao had a nice kick to it, with it being infused with Sambal sauce. The noodles itself were super broad noodles, just the way I like it. It wasn't cut into thin pieces like other places. The pad thai was pretty flavorful as well.\\n\\nAs far as the service goes, I felt it could've been better. We asked for more napkins after eating the chicken wings with our hands and the waiter only gave us ONE. There's two of us, and were both eating chicken wings! The other waiters were hovering around the restaurant trying to be attentive to our needs, which was nice. Other than that, I would highly recommend you try this spot if you're around.\", u\"This is a solid Thai spot. My boyfriend and I had the Massamun Curry with brown rice. It was flavorful and delicious. It was definitely the flavor I'm used to and I don't have any complaints. One order was enough for us to share for lunch as we also had the soup and edamame beans before hand. The restaurant is also very clean (looks newly built) and the staff was friendly.\", u\"We came here on a Saturday evening at around 7:30 PM, and the 2 of us were seated right away. I really love the decor! The simple tile, wood furniture, exposed brick, and plants hanging from the ceiling and on the shelves are so cute. I also love how cohesive the rustic plant theme is; the menu is gorgeously designed with tiny little plants around the border, and even the napkins are stamped with leaves. \\n\\nThe waitstaff was really great about making sure we had water at all times, which I appreciated. We ordered the curry puffs and shrimp blankets as appetizers. I ordered chicken pad thai. The appetizers came out pretty quickly, and they were really tasty. The shrimp blankets were crisp and the sauce that came with them were really good. The curry puffs were slightly flaky and really flavorful. My pad thai was absolutely delicious. The portions weren't huge, and there was a great balance of all the different ingredients.\\n\\nThe only reason I did not give this restaurant 5 stars is because our entrees took FOREVER to come out. We probably waited for like 45 minutes between the time when our apps were taken away to the time our actual entrees came out, and by that time I wasn't really hungry anymore. Our server didn't even keep us posted or give us a reason as to why the food took so long. This restaurant is so cute and really tasty, but I don't think I would be willing to come again with the wait being so ridiculous.\", u\"Lovely spot, tastefully decorated and the food is yummy. I wish the portions were a bit smaller along with the prices but good to know that it's best to share certain menu items there, such as the soups, which come in a very large portion. The chive pancakes are delicious and so is Pad See Ew. Definitely a nice spot for a lunch date!\", u'Yay, new Thai delivery!\\n\\nI love ordering from here when I\\'m craving Panang. It\\'s consistently delicious and super flavorful. I particularly like their lunch specials, which are ~ $10 and come with soup or salad and a choice of a \"side appetizer\": crispy spring roll, fried chive pancake, steamed dumpling, fried tofu, or truffle salt steamed edamame. I always go with a medium-spicy level Shrimp Panang with soup and crispy spring roll. It\\'s a decent amount of food so I always have leftovers. The shrimp is also perrrrfectly cooked (not overcooked and rubbery), so I super appreciate that. The spring roll is crispy and the dipping sauce is tangy. The soup is a clear broth with some veg (cabbage, carrot, etc.) - very simple but a nice addition to eat with the flavorful curry. I just love how consistent the curry flavor is - it\\'s always exactly what I expect!\\n\\nI haven\\'t had anything else here yet but would be happy to try some other dishes.', u'What a cute place! perfect for the neighborhood.  I went on a Sunday for dinner.  The service was good and the atmosphere is charming.  Looking forward to when the backyard opens.\\n\\nwings - very tasty\\nmango salad - wow this was delicious\\ncrispy duck - very good\\n\\nWe cleaned our plates! finger licking goodness!\\n\\nI look forward to going back and trying more food.  I am sure this rating will go up after trying a few more dishes.  Welcome to the neighborhood!', u\"Came on a Friday Night around 8 PM and the restaurant was packed! We were told a 15-20 minute wait and they seated us at the bar since it was raining outside. My friends and I loved the decor of the restaurant. Each wall had a different personality! One side was fully furnished with mirrors, the other had lights with doves on them, another had a shelf with mini sculptures and plants. \\n\\nI ordered a calamari $8 to share and the Chicken Kao Soy noodle soup $15. The calamari came on a shell held by a larger plate. Love the shell concept but it just meant smaller portion of the calamari :( The Chicken Kao Soy was one of the more popular options mentioned by previous yelper's so I chose that. It comes with egg noodles, some fermented veggies, a chicken leg, and some crispy crackers. The chicken leg was extremely tender, the meat came off the bone effortlessly. The broth had a very strong taste of coconut, it was a little overpowering but the taste gets boring. \\n\\nMy friends ordered the chicken wings $8, Pad See Ew with chicken $12, and Pad Thai $12. They all enjoyed their dishes. Nourish had a great lunch deal, so I might return just to try something from their lunch menu.\", u\"We were looking for a decent place to eat before catching a show at Barclays & found this place through Yelp. \\nWe came in & were seated right away drinks I had the Thai Lychee iced tea good tea my friend had the Mango drink very good great taste. \\nAppetizers we had an order of the Calamari this was delicious, lightly battered great sweet chili dipping sauce. \\nMain dish I went with the Chicken Thai rice very good great taste plenty of chicken nicely stacked doesn't look like a lot but it is very filling. \\nMy friend had the Chicken Pad Thai very good good as well nice tasting good dish. \\nAs for the restaurant pretty small, simple but nice decor. \\nService was good & prices are decent the food was very good certainly wouldn't mind visiting again.\", u'This place is so cute. There are plants everywhere and the back patio had string lights which I love. They have personalized napkins and all of the dishes were served looking beautiful. I had the wings, pad Thai, and green curry with tofu. The pad Thai had a lot of chicken and the curry was packed with tofu. The service was also really great. I definitely recommend!', u'Came here on a Wednesday night for a quick bite with a friend and I have no complaints!\\nOur waitress was the sweetest and offered recommendations to us which were absolutely delicious. They were very good about refilling our waters throughout the dinner which I always appreciate.\\nI ordered the Koong Ob Woonsen with shrimp and glass noodles and it was the bomb I love seafood and that was a perfect combination of a light noodle and seafood. \\n\\nLovely atmosphere and great neighborhood as well! Highly recommend.', u\"Although heavy with the oil the food is still yummy. They can afford to use far less oil in there dishes. Order lunch for two both orders were good however the pancakes were different than we were use to. Due to the amount of oil it was hard to taste the flavors in the puffy pancake )I wouldn't recommend it unless it's fried better). Noodles and added proteins were nicely cooked (not over done). Overall a great lunch spot while at work. Worth the wait for lunch, 12pm:/ oh and edemame were meh (too soft).\", u\"I'd say this restaurant is pretty great for date night in Brooklyn and perhaps enjoying a few drinks. The unique atmosphere is sort of different than the other Thai restaurants. One of the walls is open to the outside but their no outdoor seating. It a very nice concept to allow natural air flow but today I would have enjoyed some AC. \\n\\nThe service is impeccable. The waiter was prompt with her refills of water and checked in on us a couple of times throughout dinner. We ordered the chicken pad thai and pad se-ew. I know our order is consider basic. These two dishes are my Thai food benchmarks so it allow me to grade how good the food here is. The flavor was amazing and delicious. The pad thai was sour and sweet the noodle immersed with flavor. The pad se-ew favor was great as well from the sweetness to the saltness from soy sauce. \\n\\nTip:The portion size is a bit smaller  so one might need to add on some appetizers. \\nRecommend: Pad Se-Ew\", u\"So this place has some really good Thai food, it's only been open for 4 or 5 months and I'll definitely be coming back!  We had the veggie dumping, pad Thai shrimp, and spicy kea mao.  We are every last bite of all the dishes \\n\\nAlso No alcohol license yet but they are working on it :(\", u'What a very cute place!!!!! We were randomly walking and enjoying the weather and we had to stopped by this place because of their cute decor. The greenery is very cutely put together. I am impressed by their design. Second impression is their food, it was sooooo amazing that i had to make another trip to this place (I live in Queens). Everything was simply delicious. Their Pad Thai is the best of all. No one cant even beat. We ordered lot of food and everything was delicious (see pictures below). Finally i would really recommend this place to everyone. Love their food so much that i wish it closed to my house.', u'The design of this space was phenomenal.  The thai tea and coffee were superb and the staff was VERY friendly.  Service was quick!\\n\\nThe pad thai was a tad sweet for my taste, but I added some chilis and it was perfect.\\n\\nI would 100% go back.', u\"I and my hubby walked past this new place and we were surprised that they are Thai restaurant because we can't tell from their decoration. Their decoration is lively, bright and nice so they got my attention. We stepped in to see the menu and decided to stay. It was one of the best decisions of the day!!!\\n\\nFor appetizer, We ordered roti with Massaman curry dipping sauce. The roti was crispy and flaky. It's perfect for my liking. The sauce was flavorful and thick (which I like). This dish is a must try if you are bored with regular Thai appetizers (I'm talking about boring dumpings, Spring rolls LoL)\\n\\nWe also ordered Mango avocado salad which is refreshing and perfectly spicy (I can't handle Thai spicy, but I can handle this one) \\n\\nFor main courses,  I ordered Pad thai shrimp because I like to judge how good Thai restaurant is from their Pad Thai and their pad thai is beyond my expectation. I can say that it is one of the best Pad Thai in NY. Their noodle was perfectly cooked. (Most Thai restaurants in NY fail to cook noodle perfectly. Most of them are too soft and mushy)  \\nUnlike the ones from most Thai restaurant in US, It's not too oily. \\n\\nMy hubby ordered Kao soy chicken which was awesome! Their curry soup was flavorful (similar to the dipping sauce in the roti dish) The chicken in this dish was perfectly cooked too! It was tender and juicy.\\n\\nWe also ordered Gai yang with som tum (Grilled Chicken with papaya salad and sticky rice) because we saw how good it looks from the neighbor table. We both agree that this dish was the best dish of the meal! Their chicken was juicy and flavorful because it was marinated with some yellow herb (I don't know what it was but it was good) It was perfect when eating with sweet&spicy sauce and sticky rice. Papaya salad on the side was good too!   \\n\\nFor the drink we had mango mocktail and Thai iced tea. Both drink were amazing!\\n\\nWe also tried their Thai tea panna cotta ( For those who may wonder how many our parties are, we are just 2 persons who eat a lot LoL) \\nThis dessert was excellent too! Their texture was smooth. We love it! \\n\\nWe couldn't think of any negative side of this place so this place absolutely gets a 5-star from us! Needless to say, we will be back. Keep up good food!\\n\\n\\nNote: They have beautiful backyard, but they are still working on the permit. I hope they can open their backyard soon. It will be perfect outdoor dinner in the summer\", u'Wonderful!  Great little place for some clean Thai food.  I tried the dumplings and they were excellent.', u\"Probably some of the best Thai I've ever had in NYC. Everything was spot on--Kua Gai with mock duck, pra ram with tofu, and spring rolls. And even the spring rolls were something to write home about! \\n\\nWill definitely come back when I'm in the neighborhood. Food was fast, but came lateish on a Wednesday. \\n\\nReally, really delicious. Damn.\"], u'108.Brown Butter': [u\"My first time here, and I love it already.  Very spacious, staff is friendly, and the seats are comfortable (table is big enough for my giant textbook, which is a bonus).  Didn't get to see the patio because there was a kid's birthday party, but yay! for a local place that supports families, as well.\\n\\nOrdered the avocado toast with onion jam & goat cheese, as well as the matcha latte with the pretty design on top.  Loved them both.\\n\\nCan't wait till they have later hours, so that I can visit after work during the week; I hear they're waiting on their liquor license.\", u\"Nice clean place with good music, friendly staff, and wifi. I can see myself going again, especially since it's right in my neighborhood. \\n\\nMy only gripe is the price of food and drinks. I went there to get some writing done and spent about $30. All I had was a cup of their acai berry yogurt with fruit (which was $6 by itself), a matcha green tea latte for breakfast and then I got the Curry Chicken Salad Sandwich (which was tasty) around lunchtime.  \\n\\nTo be exact, I spent $27.49 but I tipped on top of that so I round it up to $30. That's a lot. I can't spend that kind of money in a cafe on a regular basis so I can't say this spot will be my go to.   \\n\\nGlad to have Brown Butter in the neighborhood as an option though!\", u\"Really excited to have this place in the neighborhood!  Nice range of food and drink menu options, including fun things like Matcha + OJ and beet root latte.  Very friendly staff, great vibe/atmosphere for dining or setting up shop with your laptop.  The outdoor patio is nice and quiet, and since it's shaded, you can actually work outside on your laptop and see your screen, lol.\\n\\nA little confused by the first review...they play music (I'm here as I type this review) but it's not overpowering... this is a coffee shop where people come to connect and/or get work done -\\nit's not a nightclub.\", u'Stumbled upon this place walking around. The artisan vibe is everything, and I thought the cayenne Hot chocolate was delicious. (Maxwell playing in the background). I will have to comeback for the food and the brown butter biscuits (supposedly the shit!). The also have a back patio and WiFi if you want to work.', u\"Chill, cozy spot for coffee or a no-fuss breakfast/weekend brunch. There's a backyard with picnic tables, and plenty of seating space inside (compared to the cramped Peaches Hot House next door). Come solo with a book or a small group of friends!\", u'The signature menu item appeared to be the breakfast sandwich on a brown butter biscuit, but they were out of biscuits.  So, I had an Acai bowl instead.  It was good, but nothing exceptional.  The general vibe of this place seemed less friendly than the place across the street I ended up getting a breakfast sandwich from.', u\"Had the mac and cheese had chai lemonade which were delicious! Staff was very warm and friendly..great customer service is a big deal for me being a waitress. Couldn't decide on a drink and the barista immediately helped me decide on something. Decor is nice with a rustic warm theme. Outdoor area is so cute and fun with the logo engraved in the wooden tables. I'll definitely be visiting again.\", u\"Nice place! Good to have another option for light fare and coffee. Design is nice and clean along with a backyard. Big range of prices on the menu. Avocado toast for $12 seems a bit pricey. Housemade biscuit was good. Barista was welcoming, friendly and provided us with a lot of information about the concept and plans of the coffee program. One thing I'd hoped for is the use of more local vendors. I was a fan of intelligentsia coffee 7 years ago, I think there's plenty of local roasters that are better and local businesses should be supporting. Bread and pastries from Balthazar, which you find pretty much everywhere. Only other criticism is that there was no music playing so the atmosphere was a little empty and sleepy on a Thursday morning. I will def go back and see how they grow.\", u\"I've been here twice since it opened and I think it's great. The cold brew I had was excellent, as was the avocado toast with onion jam. They have a small but interesting menu with lots of non-coffee beverage options. Plus, the space is really nice and they have outdoor seating in the backyard. Unlike another commenter, I like that they don't blast music and keep a quiet atmosphere. I'll definitely be going back!\"], u'91.Chuko': [u\"Alas! Another check off my food bucket list! And the food did not disappoint!\\n\\nMe and my friends had the chicken bone ramen, pork bone ramen, and the miso. All were super light and flavorful. You would think there'd be some flavor loss in chicken soup but this isn't Campbell chicken noodle soup!\\n\\nIf you like light soups that aren't too salty, this is the place for you! I plan to come here if I am ever sick... the soup reminds me of mom's homemade soup.\", u\"I've been here 2  times and I had great experiences both times. Really good ramen in Brooklyn! Their menu is very simple which I always believe is great. Hipster atmosphere and ambiance, shared seating at bigger tables and simple decor.\\n\\nRamen was absolutely delicious. There's about 5 to pick from and also various add ons. Bowl starts at $16 (city prices in Brooklyn). Buttttttttttt for a delicious bowl of ramen, it's a deserving price tag. We also ordered some appetizers, the gyoza was delicious and they give you a nice portion to share and we had the wings, they were decent. I ordered the pork bun for $5 (comes one pork bun), I don't think pork bun should be $5 may be they should do like 2 buns for $8. It was good but not great. It also had too much going on and took away the simplicity of a good pork bun.\\n\\nBut I was soooo hot inside. It was may be 80 degrees outside and humid and it felt like it was 90 degrees inside the restaurant. It was uncomfortable, more so when you are eating a bowl of ramen. \\n\\nService was top notch! Great spot and great ramen! Do check them out.\", u\"Oh, Chuko. Wha happened, bhai?!\\n\\nThis place was the-spot to get ramen in Brooklyn three years ago. My ex and I frequented it. I've taken other dates and friends.\\n\\nI returned a few days ago; my first time in their new space. I take-out ordered the Pork Bone Ramen with roasted pork and the kale salad. The ramen broth was bland as fuck, not even salty as some reviewers suggested. I had to remix it with some homemade kimchi my friend's mother lovingly made. She put her feet and her backside in it because it definitely helped turn my foodie frown into a smile. $16 though?! What's up with these expensive-ass ramen places that don't live up to anything: broth flavor, produce ingredients, etc. I guess I have to trek to Midtown West for delicious ramen, unless there's better in Brooklyn. For shame.\\n\\nThe saving grace, aside from the kimchi living in my fridge, was the kale salad. The tempura-fried bits are still crunchy and delicious, along with the tangy, umami-flavored dressing and sweetness of the raisins for the perfect balance. Some people have complained about the portion size, but my takeaway container did not disappoint.\\n\\nChuko needs help though. Maybe I'll try another ramen in the future, because I do believe in him. Or maybe not.\", u'Love the shrimp buns @this place. But the miso veg ramen was not good. At. All, the last time I went. After a cross country trip and taxi from manhattan, I was simply disappointed at all the money I spent for bland ramen!! They explained something about seasonal veggies as the cause for the change. The broth was frothy and different too. Still love Chuko, but they need to get it together for real. Instead of just thanking me for feedback, offering a credit would be more acceptable.\\n\\nGreat service otherwise!!', u\"Delicious ramen with high quality ingredients, nice modern and laid back atmosphere and don't miss the kale salad and Braven Bushwick Pilsner\", u'Super friendly service, laid back atmosphere, and some delicious ramen. Enjoyed their local favorite Veggie Miso (added pork) and a Shrimp Bun. My friend enjoyed the Kimchi Ramen and the Pork Bun.', u'Had a steamed pork bun and pork gyoza to start. Both were delicious. The pork belly in the steamed bun was perfect.  The gyoza were filled with a flavorful pork mix and fried to crispy perfection. \\n\\nTried the kimchi and miso ramen. Both were delicious. Broth is perfection and accompaniments are great too. The kimchi ramen was my favorite. \\n\\nLines and wait can be lengthy so be prepared', u'I just ate at Brighton beach. So had only room for a kale salad when meeting my friend. Now I dont like kale. So it must have been my higher power who wanted me to try the kale salad. DAMN that little bowl of overpriced $9 green was THE BOMB! We chatted a lot i did hear my friend say \"meat is good\" she had ramen. We went to see logan lucky. Baby driver was better. Thought you needed to know that...oh and the server was this petite girl\\nShe had short hair and black tats, totally hot stuff..', u'Despite having trouble picking up my noodles, which for a seasoned ramen eater is unthinkable, I still give this place a five star rating. \\n\\nSo, the noodles are really good. They are also cooked perfectly. But, they kind of stick together like a ball of yarn. I had to use my spoon to help myself (first time, I promise), and this was a bit embarrassing. But, just in case you think I am overreacting, I did ask those next to me at the counter, and we all concurred, it was hard to pick up those noodles. Also, those sitting next to me were Japanese people, just in case you wondered...\\n\\nSo how do I bump 3 stars to 5 stars? Flavor. I ordered the vegetarian ramen, and the flavor of the broth was very good, somewhat exotic. Plus, it was not over salted, a technique other places use.\\n\\nI also ordered a shrimp bun, and it was cooked, seasoned and dressed perfectly.\\n\\nChuko is a really good spot.', u\"Heard this place is a must visit if you're a Brooklynite - mission accomplished. Chuko has a nice location, about 10 mins or so away from Barclays Center. It's also about 15 mins from the 7th Avenue train station and is convenient to reach.\\n\\nHad the chili soy wings. They were really well done; the combination of the chili and the sauce added a nice kick to it. We also had the shrimp buns which were OK, but could have used a bit more sauce to soften the dryness of the shrimp.\\n\\nMy main dish was the chicken bone ramen with extra chicken. The broth was good, not as overpoweringly salty as some of ramen broths that I've had in my time. There was also a slight dash of lemon that was an unexpected surprise. The noodles were good.\\n\\nI'll definitely be back since it's about 20 mins from me.\", u'Finally came here to try ramen and we were all satisfied. Love the decor, really gave me a feel of simple, clean, Japan. Staff were very nice. I love places where i can see the kitchen. Really tells me somethin when chefs dont mind cookin w all the eyes watchin.\\n\\nWe got the brussel sprouts, chicken wings, each a bowl of ramen. I had the miso flavor while my bf and sis got the pork bone flavor. The pork bone flavor was very light. The miso flavor was much more buttery/creamy. We all enjoyed our ramen. My ramen was different from theirs, mine was curly and slightly thicker, i think its cos of my soup base. Cant imagine it goin w the pork bone flavor. Their ramen were thinner and bouncy but straight.\\n\\nThe roasted pork was melt in ur mouth (like buttaaaa) and the egg was cooked jus right (not ur typical egg yolk thats way too cooked, its medium well poached yolk!) yum.\\n\\nBrussel sprouts were packed w flavor. Must order it! The spicy wings had a great kick! Loved it!\\n\\nAnd to top it off, use the bathroom and check out that beautiful message on the mirror! ;)', u\"The Kale Salad....! I mean I know I came for Ramen... but I would have been so satisfied if the only thing I ate was the Kale Salad... lucky for you I'm greedy and couldn't leave after just eating that! \\n\\nThe kale salad is a marriage of taste in your mouth. It's sweet, it's crispy, it's sour, it's healthy... it's basically everything! I also had their Brussel sprouts and those were really tasty as well. The vegetable appetizers here really get you ready for the ramen. After all that green deliciousness I just want to down carb and fat laden salty broth! Ha! \\n\\nNo seriously though... the Ramen was pretty good! It was well balanced the Noodles where delicious and the chicken in my Ramen was so tender. You can tell this wasn't something they just threw in a bowl. These soups are well planned and thought out to hit every flavor note and texture. \\n\\nI loved it and if I'm craving ramen or Kale! I'd definitely be back!\", u'Came here today at 530 for their second opening, and this place filled up quickly! Literally, we walked in at 530 waiting for them to open, and they were packed by 615.  Good service, friendly staff, great Ramen! I ordered the Roast Pork Ramen which was excellent. You\\'ll definitely want to get a side order of their hot sauce.. I don\\'t remember exactly what it was called but it was some kind mixture of chili peppers, olive oil, and garlic of some sort...maybe? Either was it was a great add in to the Ramen. For apps we tried their Brussels sprouts, pork gyoza, and tots...all great, I definitely recommend! The Brussels sprouts were my favorite! \\n\\nAlso, lots of available free parking on the block. \\n\\nThey only thing I wasn\\'t a fan of was the seating arrangement. They\\'ll put three people at a five person table..and as the restaurant fills up.. they\\'ll seat people at the table with you. Not exactly my kind of thing. Yet, I notice a lot of restaurants are doing the whole \"picnic table\" style eating. But I do understand the restaurant isn\\'t exactly large. And there were two people tables available and you could also sit at the bar. But if you\\'re coming with more than one person, you risk the chance of having to sit at a table with people who are in the middle of their meal. \\nEither way...everything else was great, I highly recommend! I\\'ll be back!', u\"I came here with a friend on a Sunday night and was surprised to see how pack it was. We got seated right away and ordered quickly since the kitchen was closing soon. I ordered the miso ramen and my friend got the chicken broth ramen with extra pork. We also ordered the okonomiyaki style tots to share and it was crispy topped with sauce and pork flakes? Not bad but wouldn't order again. My miso ramen soup was good, I like it more than my friend's. The broth was flavorful and the noodle texture just right. The ramen order was a good portion and we were both stuffed.\\n\\nOverall, it's a good ramen spot in Brooklyn Heights.\", u'My husband and I came here after Yoga in the Park on a Thursday around 8:15PM. The place was pretty packed but we were able to get a table for 2 right away. Our friends recommended this place a while ago to us and warned us of the lines outside so we were prepared. It worked out well for us though! \\n\\nThey took our order fairly quickly which was nice because we were hungry after yoga! I ordered the miso ramen with tofu and my husband got the chicken ramen. We each added a poached egg to ours. \\n\\nThe food came out FAST, which again, we were grateful for. My miso was ah-may-zing. It had such great flavor and was so unbelievably tasty. There were tons of great noodles and veggies in it and I loved it. My husband, who regularly eats ramen at a very authentic place by his work said this was really close to that. A high compliment! The ramen is very salty, just a warning. I suppose all ramen is but still, wanted to warn folks. You\\'re going to need a lot of water. I actually woke up in the night so thirsty from this meal. It was still worth it.\\n\\nAs the sun was setting, we got a truly gorgeous view. The pink/red sun set over the buildings in downtown Brooklyn and the view through the giant windows in the front was perfect with the neon Chuko sign in the foreground. It actually felt like a movie shot. \\n\\nThey get you in and out here which is very true to an authentic ramen spot. The prices are reasonable and the staff were accommodating. My only \"issue (I put in quotes because it\\'s not a huge deal)\" is that the tables are very close together. We could hear every bit of the conversation the couple on a date was having next to us. We didn\\'t care, but they might have....hahah.', u\"My wife likes going out for ramen a lot more than I do. I usually try to steer her toward another cuisine when deciding where to eat. I have a hard time disagreeing with Chuko though. The only problem I had was that it was so small and a pain to wait for a table in cold seasons, when I really want ramen. They've remodeled a bigger space and now I can never say no to her.\\n\\nThe kimchi ramen is sooooo good.\", u'If you want \"white\" appropriated ramen then this is the place to be. A sad, bland bowl of hot shit. They charge for everything, who charges for chilli oil?', u'Very flavorful broth that\\'s not greasy. Towards the end, it does get a bit too salty. While the broth and noodles were good (subbed out regular noodles for the yellow noodles), the pork was very dry. Ordered their soft boiled egg (you get to choose between hard or soft egg) which turned out to be a poached egg.. I guess a \"hard egg\\' is an actual soft boiled egg. If you like garlic, definitely get the garlic chili oil!\\n\\nIn addition to the ramen, ordered the okonomiyaki and kale salad. The okonomiyaki is a twist on the normal pancake-style. It comes with the sauce on tots - tasting exactly how you\\'d expect.  The kale salad was sweet, crunchy and refreshing. It had golden raisins with some type of veggie tempora.\\n\\nOverall, highly recommend the food and there was hardly a wait on a weekday evening.', u'I have bookmarked this place for a while. Read the reviews and disagree with some people!  \\n\\nThe servers were friendly and nice. Took great care through out our dining time. They made my noodle extra soft because I had wisdom teeth extraction.  Recommended me dishes I can chew on without hurting myself.  \\n\\nRamen was delicious!  I love the noodle and broth!  Two most important ingredients in ramen!  5 stars for this place for sure!', u\"Here is the run down:\\n\\n- Hottest day of the year thus far and I wanted RAMEN! \\n\\n- Pork bone ramen w/ roasted pork and garlic hot chili sauce - bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb. I want some right now. Hella noodles. Like overkill. I needed more broth. It was all noodles. \\n\\n- Salt and pepper wings - They were okay. Not my fave wings ever but okay.\\n\\n- Service - slow AF. We had to keep trying to get the server's attention. \\n\\n- Reasonably priced.\\n\\n- I want to go back and try the miso broth ramen.\"], u'136.Avocaderia': [u\"Was very hipsterish if you're into that stuff. Portions are small, but they do give you an entire half of an avocado. The presentation was nothing like what it looked like on that TimeOut video on Facebook. \\n\\n3/5\", u'I was visiting a friend this past weekend and I have been wanting to go to this place since e I saw the ad on Facebook. I asked my friend to meet me at Avocaderia. \\n\\nWe went there on  Sunday around 12 pm and there was no line. Staff we super nice and welcoming. They have avocado salad, smoothie, toast, sandwich. \\n\\nI ordered the Beet hummus avocado toast. It was yummy.', u\"I was really excited to try this place, but was a little underwhelmed with what I actually got. I ordered the Chill Out, the Beets & Blue salad, and the avo chocolate mousse.\\n\\nFrankly, the Chill Out was not very impressive...the spicy flakes and oil didn't do much in terms of adding flavor or depth to that toast. It just tasted like avocado on top of a piece of bread--very one note. Maybe I'm just used to having some lemon juice in my avocado to give it a hit of acid. \\n\\nThe Beets & Blue was much more impressive in terms of presentation and taste. I enjoyed the dressing with the watermelon radish, beets, and blue cheese. My issue with this dish is that I don't feel like the avocado added much. It was placed in the salad in the form of chunky cubes and would have been fine without it, which isn't what you expect from a place dedicated to avocados.\\n\\nLastly, I finished with their avo chocolate mousse for dessert. It looked very unimpressive and TINY, considering it was 7 dollars. I guess I can understand after tasting it...it was sooooo sweet that I had trouble finishing it even with an additional person. To the mousse's credit, it did taste very strongly of an extremely concentrated mixture of fudge, which I guess is a good thing? I'm still confused about how I feel about this, because the strong flavor was good, but it was just too sweet to eat more than a spoonful at a time.\\n\\nOverall, considering I paid around $30 and left feeling rather unsatisfied, I wouldn't really recommend Avocaderia to the most dedicated of avocado lovers.\", u'Is it good? It is fresh avocado so of course it is. I ordered the El Salmon, which is smoked salmon and avocado. The smoked salmon was good but you can get similar at a supermarket (I assume it might even be from Costco across the street). In my opinion, Avocaderia is like hibachi for avocados. It tastes good but you are mainly paying the premium price for the presentation, which is very photogenic. My friends ordered the Avoburger (avocado bun and smoked salmon patty) and an egg avocado toast. Both looked amazing. The cold pressed juices also very good. I had the greens which included kale, spinach, apple, etc. It was good.\\nIn terms of location, it is kind of in the middle of nowhere in Industry City. It is also not in the best area (e.g. there is a dispensary bin for used needles close by).\\n\\nFor avocado fans, it is definitely fun to experience it once. However, the price and location makes it difficult to be a regular. It weekday hours are the work hours so most people could only go on the weekends.', u\"My coworkers and I made our way to industry city to try this. I will say, that I agree this place is definitely overhyped. \\nI got the breakfast avo, which was one piece of toast with a ton of avocado and boiled egg. The avocado was okay, the egg was perfect. \\n\\nA few other things- it took me 20 mins to get my food. Not cool at all, especially because when we ordered there wasn't a line. The team did offer me a free beverage, but I wanted to leave at that point. I probably won't go back.\", u\"MEH.\\n\\nI'll get straight to my point.\\n\\nMEH. $15 for the Avocado burger. Presentation is nice. Taste is fresh, but to be honest.. nothing you can't make yourself at home for even cheaper.\\n\\nIt's overhyped in my opinion.\", u\"It's good but nothing great, no complain regarding hygiene or staff but food feels way over priced for unique concept . \\nWe tried Mediterranean toast and avoburger, meh !\", u\"I heard so much about this place; I knew I had to give it a try! I came by around 11am and there was absolutely no wait, which was kind of surprising considering all the hype this place has.\\nI ordered the mango avocado smoothie which had avocado, mango, almond milk, lime, and agave. I also ordered the egg avocado toast which wasn't on the menu but was a special on their sign outside.\\nThe drink was refreshing but too expensive, in my opinion. The toast was very pretty - definitely Instagram-worthy but also overpriced. It was probably 2 whole avocados and a soft boiled egg on whole wheat toast.\\nHonestly, I love avocados but paying almost $18 for 2 items was more than I expected. This is a one time try or a once in a while place, in my opinion.\", u\"I've been excited about this place ever since I first heard about it.  I mean, an entire restaurant dedicated to avocados is just what the world needed.  Every time I came to IC, it was closed, but finally stopped by today and it was open.  Unfortunately it was not everything I had dreamed.\\n\\nThe menu options aren't very exciting or as innovative as I imagined.  It's just a couple of selections of avocado toast, a few salads and sandwiches, and smoothies.  I contemplated getting something from somewhere else, but since I've been looking forward to this place for so long, I ended up getting the chill out, which is multigrain toast, avocado mash (read guacamole without the flavor) and schichimi.  It wasn't awful.  I did have to go back to add salt because even with the shichimi, there wasn't much taste to it.  Still, I wouldn't have been too disappointed with the choice had it not been for the underripe avocado.  Two big chunks were hard enough that I couldn't even bite through them. I didn't even know that could happen!  I guess with the avocado shortage people are calling dibs long before the fruit is ready to be plucked from the tree.\\n\\nThis place is better in concept that it is in real life.  Come for the novelty, I guess, but not for the product.\", u'This place is sick! A little hard to find as its tucked away in this food court and it doesnt say the name but its there. Shuts at 5 so like the other reviewers said, its better to get there early but we reached 4.45p. There were 3 people before us. We ordered some coffee and lemonade. For the food there were so many choices, we stuck with the Yelp favorite Avo Burger and the Let It Beet. Both were delish! Its a tad bit expensive. With the tip, tax, everything it was $36 for 2 people so for a food court, you serve yourself kinda place, in an obscure industrial area in Brooklyn, its expensive. For all Avocada lovers, this spot is a must. I loved the Let it Beet on Sourdough. Definitely coming back.', u\"Cool concept.  I love avocados so obviously stopping off here for lunch was a must.  I got the greek salad and it had All. The. Flavors.  It was so flavorful I had to pause mid salad to collect my thoughts.  It felt like every bite had 48 ingredients.  I can't wait to go back and try something else, but my taste buds need time to recollect themselves.\", u\"3.5-4 stars. Came here on a busy Sunday afternoon. Wait wasn't insane and I got my order pretty quickly. \\n\\nAvocaderia most definitely uses the freshest ingredients! Avocados are perfectly ripe too.\\n\\nAvoburger - legit an entire avocado is used. Salmon was good but not overly ah-mazing. It's served on a bed of fresh greens so I ended up eating it like a salad. \\n\\nLet it Beet toast - my favorite, but wouldn't mind tasting the beet a little more.\", u'I suppose I should start with a disclaimer: I am not obsessed with avocados. I enjoy them, sure, but I don\\'t have the need to eat one on a daily basis (or even weekly).\\n\\nAs such, I was more of an observer/passive taster for my trip to Avocaderia. Industry City\\'s food hall is awesome, but this was the only place with a massive line. I don\\'t think it\\'d be a stretch to say the line demographics were the epitome of \"basic\"--you knew that after eating here, these people were going to Target to buy coconut water and yoga pants.\\n\\nAnyways, that\\'s besides the point. My SO ordered the \"El Salmon\" - bread, salmon, cream cheese, \"green\" pico and a mustard-agave sauce.\\n\\nFor the price (nearly $12), they actually give you a pretty good amount of food. I was disappointed with the amount and quality of the smoked salmon--it wasn\\'t great, but there was a TON of avocado and the bread was a huge slice.\\n\\nAs for the toast? It was pretty good, but I really think they need to work on their flavors. The mustard-agave didn\\'t work for me--it definitely needed dill (and no sugar)--and I think giving more of the salmon would go a long way. But still, it was fine to eat.\\n\\nMy major gripe with the whole meal was the lemonade. For $3.25, you get a cup of ice and about 3 tablespoons of lemonade. Come on, man--I shouldn\\'t be able to finish my lemonade in one sip. That\\'s just nonsense.\\n\\nAnyways, a solid 3 stars. If they give you more (and higher quality) lox and don\\'t screw you on the beverage, I\\'d bump it up to 4. Work on the flavor.\\n\\nOH, last thing: $5 for a tiny avocado pin the size of a dime? Are you out of your goddamn mind?', u\"Definitely worth trying for the first time. I normally don't eat bread or cheese, but still came here to try the avocado toast with beets and blue cheese. It's over priced, and probably easy to make, but since I can't cook, I'll come back for more avocado salad and toasts.\", u'Avocados definitely make everything better! BUT .....\\n\\nThis place is cute and the service is quick but it is avocado overload, the Avoburger is more like a salad and WAY too much avo and not enough of anything else. I\\'ve been making Avocado toast before it was \"a thing\" and I still think I make it better than any other place. I also split the Mediterranean toast, it was tasty and filling. Cute experience when I\\'m on one of my health kicks but probably won\\'t be back. 30+ dollars is a little much for me for some toast and a salad. Next time I\\'ll probably just stick to a bottomless brunch :o)', u\"I lost my avocado toast virginity (if you will) here, and clearly I held out for the best.  I went with the Beets & Blue (smashed avocado / spring greens / watermelon radish / beets / blue cheese / pepitas / honey mustard, sourdough), and it was mindblowingly delicious.  It was about $9/$10 but hefty and the perfect brunch. Cold brew is some of the best I've had in the city, and only ran about $3. \\n\\nLife hack: if you come here right when they open on Sunday (11:00 am), there's no wait and the Industry City Food Hall is completely vacant - pretty cool. The only downside is that it's a bit of a trek from Manhattan, though it is near the B/D and N/R stop on the BK side.\", u'Basically Avocado + other things. Pretty bland.\\n\\nI saw the insider video, so decided to take a longer lunch break to try this restaurant on Friday (this restaurant only open during lunch hours on weekdays).\\n\\nThe small restaurant (or should I say food stand) was located in a food court, so plenty of seat in the common area. I liked the spacious food court.\\n\\nAbout the food, my friend and I ordered the El Salmon (smoked salmon on avocado toast), and the avoburger (avocado sandwiching smoked salmon and mayo on a bed of sald.\\n\\nAvocado was fresh, salmon was skimpy. They tasted like how they were originally.\\n\\nWould you pay $17 after tax for 1 avocado, little smoked salmon slices, some veggies, and a nice representation? You answer the question yourself haha.', u'$$$ but as an avocado monster, I was happy to empty my wallet. Pretty grateful this place exists. Also, service for me this day was 10/10.', u\"3 or maybe 3.5 stars out of 5.\\n\\nI came on an extremely rainy day that must have kept the crowds away. Fortunately I didn't have to wait at all. I was tossing up between the 'let it beet' and 'beet & blue' toasts, and I chose the latter. I kind of regretted this decision and was even considering going back for a second order, then I decided against it. In hindsight I think I may have enjoyed the first one more.\\n\\nIt's a small store in Industry City so there are no chairs inside, you eat out at the communal tables. Staff were pleasant but I didn't chat with them much. The beet & blue was good but not mind blowing - I've definitely had better. Not being a snob but since avocado toast has been a common snack in Australia my whole life just the mere sight of it isn't enough to impress me. In terms of flavouring I also thought that the quantities of beets, blue cheese and dressing overpowered the avocado. \\n\\nAlso, the thing is damn near impossible to eat neatly. It comes in the bottom half compostable lunch food container and the high sides make the highly piled toast hard to pick up. The minute I did all of the beets & blue cheese went flying off. These heavy chunks were teetering on an unstable pile of arugula and thus the avocado base couldn't hold them. By the end it was all over my hands. It also didn't have 'the look' I was expecting from their Instagram. All of those toasts seem to be 'avo rose' central but I didn't see any coming out today. I think a rose may have also been helpful in keeping the toppings on. \\n\\nI didn't really have an issue with the price. This is fancy avocado toast place and it is Industry City. The avocado burger (where the avocado is the bun) was pushing the price point a little for me - almost $15.\\n\\nTo summarize, I'm glad I tried it and I'm sure they will continue to improve over time. The concept is good and I'd be interested to try the shakes or different toast. However I don't think I'd be willing to wait in a long line or go out of my way to come back. I'd also suggest they get plates for those who want to eat the toast immediately (and I'm sure most are). Easier to eat and easier to photograph for Instagram and Yelp - win win. \\n\\nAlso, huge compliments to them on their PR and marketing - it is really excellent. People in Sydney have even been suggesting I go here , so they definitely got the word out! The 11-4 weekday hours are a little limiting. I'm sure there will be some disappointed foodies and tourists who won't be able to stop by. Perhaps they will expand their operations over time.\", u'Avocaderia is a place for the avocado-obsessed looking to explore new and creative ways to enjoy avocado. Great concept for avocado lovers such as myself except I do not see myself coming as a regular but more so on days when I\\'m feeling a little adventurous with my avocado cravings.\\n\\nFood - We ordered the Greek Salad, El Salmon toast, and the Avoburger. The avoburger was a bit disappointing. The \"burger\" was made up one of large avocado split into two with salmon, yogurt sauce, and some greens in between. It was surrounded by even more greens and pita chips. I guess I expected more for something that costs $14. The Greek salad was the best out of the 3 dishes--very flavorful, very fresh. \\n\\nLocation - This place is not easy to get to, which again ties in with the fact that this is not a place I would be a regular for. I\\'d only come around every time they come up with a new innovative dish. \\n\\nTheir concept is great. I just don\\'t think I\\'d go out of my way to come here.'], u'184.983-Bushwick\\u2019s Living Room': [u\"I visited 983 for the first time this week for dinner and enjoyed my experience, so much that I'm going to test out their brunch this weekend.\\n\\nIt truly felt like I was walking into a comfy living room, with friendly servers, TVs and some great music. They have ample bar seating and plenty of tables - no reservation needed! Not only does their menu have all-day breakfast, but it boasts everything from shareable Farm Market Sides to comfort foods like tater tots, mac and cheese or chicken tenders. 983 has many options for vegans, vegetarians and carnivores - making it easy to take even your most particular friend! They have a nice array of cocktails, wines, beers and coffee beverages. \\n\\nI love that fact that it's open from 10am - 2am daily, so you could get some work done over coffee, visit 983 for breakfast, lunch or dinner or grab a drink after work. You can easily have a filling meal for about $15.\", u\"Brunch is on point. Good vibes. Good music, and some pretty chill people. What more could you ask for?\\n\\nMy stomach was growling and needed something to fill the void. So I had spent some time searching where I should eat since I was only in the area for a few days. I came across Bushwick's Living Room. Walking distance from where I was staying so that was pretty perfect. \\n\\nWe immediately had the option of choosing where to sit. Although options were limited, I still like having the choice. The bar it was! Space was kind of cramped overall, but it was in a quaint location fit for only the best. Just Kidding. But restaurants/bars in NYC just appear to be that way. \\n\\nI ordered The Sea with OJ on the side. Need to hydrate after a long weekend. The Sea was made up of cured salmon, avocado, crispy potato and sriracha hollandaise. Kid you not, I think this was one of the best eggs benedict I've ever had. I'm still thinking about it right now as I type up this review. The eggs were cooked perfectly. The salmon was fresh. The avocados were bright green and soft. I couldn't have asked for a better meal!\", u\"Really enjoyed dinner at this place. We showed up pretty late in the day, well after 10, and were seated and served promptly. Cocktails were good, though somewhat pricey, and there was an OK if not particularly impressive draft selection.\\n\\nWhat impressed me most was the food. A good variety of options were present, and the prices were very reasonable for the portions. I got the cowboy burger, which featured 3 large, crispy onion rings, jalapeno, and cheddar, as well as a tangy bbq sauce that they served me on the side. The onion rings were a little large to fit on the burger, so I ate them separately and enjoyed them just the same. The bbq sauce was not overly sweet, which I appreciated, and I happily dumped it all over the burger and dipped some fries in it. The fries were small and thinly cut, which made them easily dippable. I was given a side of chipotle mayo to use as fry dip, which I personally prefer to ketchup. As burgers go, it wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was very respectable nonetheless.\\n\\nThis restaurant also has a mix and match sides option, which looked great, and my friends took advantage of. Considering the portions on each side, 2 for 10 and 3 for 13 is very reasonable. I tried some of the crispy quinoa, the brussels sprouts, and the hummus, all of which I enjoyed. Food took a while to arrive but was worth the wait.\\n\\nI appreciate the long hours this place keeps, and the fact that the menu is easily viewable from their website (no separate PDF or anything). I'll definitely be coming back.\", u'Dreamed brunch place!! We originally did not plan to have brunch there, but due to heavy rain, we decided to give this hipster looking brunch place a try and we are so happy we did it!! I oredered seafood egg benedict and my bubby ordered huvrano rancheros! Simple and the bomb! The seafood is very fresh and light, and mixed the poched eggs...wow cannot describe how satisfying it is. Will recommend to any friend who is visiting Brooklyn. The price is very reasonable too which is not very common in lots of hipster restaurant:)', u'We came here on Sunday morning. It was literally one of the few brunch restaurants that open before 10:30am around this area. We tried the ham sandwich and 983 burger. The burger beef patties was kinda over cooked and dry for medium rare. The Monte Cristo sandwich was tasty but very salty and soggy in the middle. But overall all dishes are reasonably priced and perfect place for brunch if you wake up early and hungry', u\"Ordered delivery through Yelp Eat24 site, but the place didn't receive the order until an hour after we placed it, which was odd. They offered us a free dessert to make up for it, so that was good!\\n\\nOtherwise, the food here was great from what we were finally delivered. We got the \\n- Club Sandwich, side of fries (flavors were good, but the tomato was cut too thickly and the entire sandwich kind of fell apart)\\n- Crispy Quinoa with Avo & Feta (really interesting texture of this salad; takes some time getting used to if you're only familiar with quinoa being soft)\\n- Reuben (gluten-free bread kept my friend super happy with her choice, it looked good)\\n- Mashed Potatoes with Pesto (doesn't look too appetizing but good comfort food choice)\\n\\nWe had the \\n- Chocolate Molten Gluten-Free cake for dessert, which was actually divine. We topped it off with a dulce de leche cream sauce and it came with fresh berries, too. Overall a solid delivery option in Bushwick for comfort food.\", u\"We ordered delivery through Yelp and after about an hour I called the restaurant to get an idea of how much longer the wait was going to be.  To my surprise, they told me they had only just received my order a couple minutes prior. I decided to go ahead and keep my order even though they said it was going to be another 45 minutes. As an apology, they threw in a gluten free chocolate lava cake for free which was a really nice gesture.\\n\\nOur food arrived, and I had ordered a Reuben, crispy quinoa, and mashed potatoes. Now, I love reubens, and frequently order them when I can get a gluten free option. This one did not disappoint and I quickly devoured the entire thing. The sides were not quite as good as the sandwich though. Despite the flavors being right, I just really didn't love the crispy quinoa mainly for texture reasons. The mashed potatoes were tasty, but not worth photographing because they look like green mush (due to the pesto). I finished off the meal with the gluten free chocolate cake which was absolutely perfect. It came with some fresh strawberries, blueberries, and a cream sauce on top. So decadent!\\n\\nOverall, the food was very good but I suggest calling orders in to make sure that this place receives them in a timely fashion.\", u\"I stopped by to pick up something to-go because I had no energy to make dinner after a long day. After perusing the menu, I decided to go with the panko crusted chicken tenders and a few of the sides (brussel sprouts and corn with basil). You get to choose from a few different sauces for the chicken tenders, and I asked the server for his recommendations, to which he said BBQ. However, I think the sauce I actually got was the Thai one. It was okay, but I would have definitely preferred BBQ or at least another sauce that was a little thicker. \\n\\nThe sides were good, but a little too greasy for my liking. The description of the brussel sprouts included carmelized onions, which I usually love, but I was NOT a fan of these carmelized onions, which tasted like they had been sauteed in way too much balsamic vinegar. I ended up picking them all out and only eating the greens. The corn was delicious because it was doused in butter, and I wish I could have had more of it, but my poor heart will probably tell you different.\\n\\nPSA: It's one side for $6, two sides for $10, or 3 sides for $13, so if you are even remotely considering 3 sides instead of 2, DO IT. I played it safe and went with two sides, but when I thought about how much that additional side would have cost me.. I really regretted not getting something else. Math is not my strong suit, apparently. \\n\\nService was fine, but for take out you have to go all the way to the back of the restaurant close to the kitchen, where all the staff hangs out. Honestly, it was kind of awkward having to wait there for my food and I would have much preferred to have been allowed to sit up front with my glass of water instead of listening to them gossip about their other jobs and their love lives. Just in case you are wondering, I have much, much less of a social/love life than the people who work here.\", u\"Came here to this cozy little place for brunch with my friend Anna H on a rainy Thursday.\\n\\n I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich (have an option for vegetarian) which is replace by portobello mushrooms.\\n\\nAnna H had the Fusilli Pesto. It was a good choice because it was a big bowl of pasta.\\n\\nFor Dessert: \\n\\nI had the Just Baked Cookie and Milk which was delicious\\n\\nAnna H had the Bread Pudding topped with fresh berries.\\n\\nOverall amazing brunch experience at 983-Bushwick's Living Room!\", u\"Decided to give this place a second chance because the food and the drinks were not bad at all. Came on a Saturday morning and the place was not crowded. Was able to get a cozy seat. The service this time was a lot better. The waiter seated us fast, checked in, made sure we had everything and our food came out fast.\\n\\nWe ordered a double mimosa to share, which was a good idea because I cant imagine one person being able to drink one of those on their own (unless you want to have a Sunday Funday, then go for it). \\n\\nThe chicken and waffles were the best. The chicken was crispy and juicy and just what you want on top of your waffles. The waffles themselves were pretty standard and I didn't find anything wrong with them. Also got the granola and fruit. It was good but when has anyone been blown out of this world by granola and fruit. I think after giving this spot a second chance, I would come back for some drinks at the bar.\\n\\nNote - When I posted my first review, the manager reached out to me and was very apologetic about the experience, which I really appreciate and respect in a business.\", u\"Oooooo such a cozy spot for brunch with my friend Andrea G on this rainy Thursday. It was pretty packed when we arrived and had only two options...definitely made a U turn away from the table next to the front door and we seated by the wall with chalk board of specials. I love where there's so many options on the menu so we feel so limited.\\n\\nFood: \\n\\nAndrea G - was debating between Huevos Rancheros and Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich (have an option for vegetarian) which is replace by portobello mushrooms so she went with the Philly Cheese Steak. The sandwich had huge pieces of portobello mushrooms so that's a good thing but I would suggest since you can make certain dishes to cater to vegan and vegetarian...why not use soy protein to replace the meat option =) \\n\\nMe - too bad the Buttermilk Fried Chicken includes a thigh (my favorite) along with a drum (I strongly prefer wings) so I steered away from that dish and choose Fusilli Pesto. *pat, pat my head* I made a wonderful choice because this big bowl of pasta was so hearty mmmm\\n\\nDessert: \\n\\nAndrea G - Just Baked Cookie and Milk...omg this giant chocolate chip cookie was so delicious \\n\\nMe: - Bread Pudding topped with fresh berries...OMGoodness this was soooo amazingly yummy \\n\\nOverall amazing brunch experience at 983-Bushwick's Living Room! Bookmark it because it's super delicious flavor profiles making your palate jumped off the walls haha\", u\"Great brunch spot! Cool menu selections but slow service. Waited 20 minutes for the check and it wasn't that busy. Our food was delivered to another table too. If they can get a bit more organized, I could give 5 stars. Otherwise I recommend it for good draft beers, Bloody Mary, and breakfast/brunch food!\", u'Ordered delivery from UberEats. Delivery came pretty quickly & was still hot. The food was pretty good too. I ordered wings: suicidal & Thai spiced. I asked for all flats & they obliged, which is a bonus for me because I prefer flats. The Thai wings had feathers. Not a big deal, I know, but these were pretty big, which means it was hard to miss. Also ordered Cobb salad & \"basket\" of fries (sweet potato). The egg in the salad was boiled a bit softer than I prefer so I didn\\'t eat it but the salad was good. Was a bit out off that the fries weren\\'t in any type of container, just a paper bag. I ate them, they were fine. I would order from them again.', u\"Huge fan of this place. I'm addicted to their side dishes. Crispy Quinoa, Mashed Cauliflower, and the Spaghetti Squash are my favorites. Pair it with a nice glass of wine and I'm in heaven! They have a great brunch too. \\n\\nThe service is always relaxed, efficient and friendly. Just right. They play some good music too. Highly recommend this place.\", u'983 called to me with their robust menu of gluten free options - including gluten free bread and rolls for sandwiches and burgers.\\n\\nIt is rare that I find myself paralyzed by the amount of delicious gluten free options on a menu.\\n\\nI ordered the monster burger (two patties, fried egg, bacon, bleu cheese) on a gluten free bun. I asked, however, for only one patty. I ended up having to pay the upcharge for the gluten free bun, the full price for the burger even though I had half the meat, and I had to pay an upcharge for a different side (mashed potatoes) because their fries are NOT gluten free due to cross-contamination. I know, I know, unfortunately being GF the upcharges are a cross I often bear, but it ended up being really quite pricey for some things that I think maybe should not have been such an upcharge. \\n\\nThe food and vibe were super excellent, and our server was sweet and knowledgable about their gf offerings, so I would say this leans more toward 3.5 than 3, but unfortunately it ended up being a bit overpriced for what I got.', u\"I love this little place. Always a good, healthful-ish brunch. It can get a little cramped when it's the busy hours and brunch, but it's worth it for fairly priced food and drinks. I generally get either the market sides, veggie dog, or...who am I kidding? I've had so many things and liked them all. Good solid comfort food and all day breakfast that caters to vegetarians!\", u\"Love this place go to eat here all the time. They have THE BEST breakfast food everrrrrr. Also the burro loco is a great cocktail, I love a spicy drink :) their shrimp pimp boy is good too...though I can't eat it that often now...too many calories. :p\", u\"I had a fantastic experience during my recent dinner visit. When I used to live in the area, I'd drop by this eatery from time to time, back when it was under different ownership. Boy, did they improve just about everything here. \\n\\nThe food was excellent and even though it barely fit on our small table (I ordered a TON of food), I devoured every last morsel. Their boozy milkshakes are well worth the visit alone and I can't recommend their veggies enough. In particular, I highly recommend the brussels sprouts. They have such incredible flavor. \\n\\nOn top of it all, our server as extremely attentive and kind, even when we had questions about the menu. If I still lived down the street, this would definitely be a go-to place for me. But, regardless, I know I'll be visiting again soon.\", u'I needed a place to have a beer, a burger, and then get some work done. Bushwick\\'s Living Room seemed to fit the bill as per first Yelp impressions (which are rarely wrong).\\n\\nWalked in, sat down at the bar, and was immediately greeted by Andy, the affable salt-of-the-earth bartender. I ordered a Bell\\'s Two Hearted, then told Andy I was in the mood for a burger. He offered this gem:\\n\\n\"If you haven\\'t had a burger here, you gotta get a burger. The burger ain\\'t the best thing by any means, but...we sell more burgers than anything else. Get the burger.\" \\n\\nWith a smile and a nod, Andy whisked the menu away and went to put the order in. It was settled.\\n\\nI kicked back, sipped my brew and waited waited for the burger to arrive while Andy recounted his latest journey to me and a fellow patron.\\n\\n\"I just got back from sailing aroun on this catamaran in the British Virgin Islands for two weeks. Man, it was beautiful. $2,000, but worth it. Had to get back for a manager\\'s meeting, though.\" As he recalled the tale, I could tell some of that island state of mind had stuck around in his head; heck, maybe it had always been there. Either way, top-notch bartender, this Andy.\\n\\nFood arrived--generous-looking patty with all the fresh necessities on top, shoestring fries and a pickle.\\n\\n\"You just let me know if you need anything,\" Andy assured me.\\n\\nThe burger was even tastier than it looked. Bun lightly toasted, meat extremely fresh, lettuce, tomato and onion crisp. I was extremely pleased with the decision Andy had made for me, and told him so.\\n\\nAfter the beer and burger, I was feeling pretty sleepy, so I headed out instead of sticking around to do a little work. Andy and I exchanged a handshake, and I told him I\\'d be back soon. And I will! This may be my new afternoon hangout.', u'Amazing brunch! I had a great iced coffee and a delicious special called the Dragon Bowl (was mixed grilled veggies over brown rice with ginger and tahini sauce), and my friend had The Farm Benedict. Super reasonable prices and friendly service.'], u'166.Brooklyn Star': [u'I came here for brunch on Saturday afternoon around 2:30 PM. My boyfriend chose this location, he\\'s been here before and said their southern cooking is great. It was not packed at all, thankfully, since BK was crawling with people, it was a beautiful day especially for brunch. We plopped down at a large table in the back of the restaurant and started to scan the menu. We started off with drinks, I got the Bourbon Bonbon ($11) it\\'s an iced espresso with bourbon and condensed milk, the bf got a cool aide ($2). The bonbon was good it wasn\\'t too strong the bourbon to espresso ration was even, but for the price it\\'s small, I\\'d say somewhere between 6-8 oz. I had some of the cool aide, it was good, super sweet everything one would expect. \\n\\nFor an app we ordered the buttermilk biscuits ($4); three per order. Let me tell you they were excellent, they came out piping hot, fluffy, large, and with a warm side of butter. As soon as I slathered my biscuit in butter it melted immediately, I was in heaven! They break apart pretty easily so be prepared for crumbs everywhere, I was a mess (lol). For my main I got the chicken and waffles ($15) and the bf got the ham steak ($15). They both came out fairly quick and in massive portions. My chicken was delish, it was super crispy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside, the waffle was good, nothing out of the ordinary pretty standard. My dish also came with a large fresh grapefruit; it was so juicy and gave the dish a really nice \"fresh\" aspect since it\\'s a heavy meal. I couldn\\'t even finish my plate it was so much food! The bf enjoyed his dish and I had to try some of his mashed potatoes, they were super creamy and smooth, I\\'m happy I tired them! \\n\\nOverall I really enjoyed the food it was def southern, everything was big, hot, and tasty. The service was good, the servers were nice, and the atmosphere was laid back. I\\'ll be back again!', u\"Pretty good. Honestly, though, the best thing by far here was the biscuits. I love biscuits and always get them any time I go to brunch, and these were just superb.\\n\\nI got a cinnamon roll to share with the table and it wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was good. I liked that it had pecans, but they're not for everyone. I thought it could have used more icing.\\n\\nMy chicken and waffles were also good, but I think I might just not be a big fan of chicken and waffles in general, because I felt they were lacking something. The apple butter was tasty, but I'm not sure if it was right for this dish - I'd rather have some kind of syrup to make it less dry (not that the chicken wasn't cooked well, chicken and waffles is just kind of a dry meal in general).\\n\\nThe candied grapefruit it came with, though - that was a real treat. I'd never had anything like it.\\n\\nIt's more like a 3.5 for me, but I'll give this place 4 stars because I think I might have just ordered something that wasn't right for me. I'd like to come back and try other things on their menu.\", u\"Second time coming to the restaurant after we couldn't get in the first time around. \\n\\nBecause we weren't sure about the reservations, we just showed up 10 minutes before the restaurant opened.  There were two other parties that were also hovering around, but we were seated immediately.  The restaurant is sort of split into two.  When you walk in it's more bar-ish and further in its more of a home-y restaurant.\\n\\nThe menu is on the limited side, with a lot of pork dishes, which I have a restriction too, we were able to order dishes we could both enjoy.  We ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffles, Cuban Style Breakfast Torta, Cinnamon Bun and Buttermilk Biscuits.  The biscuits were the first to come out.  They were pipping hot and served with a side of butter and honey. Absolutely delicious! The cinnamon roll was for my girlfriend. Even though there were nuts, she enjoyed it. Let me tell you, that thing is no JOKE. It's ginormous and comes in a skillet.  She only really enjoys that center piece and enjoyed every minutes of it! I would come back just for her to have that.  The chicken and waffles were flavorful.  The waffle was nice and fluffy.  The chicken skin was crisp and the meat itself was juicy.  My girlfriend had the cubano and said that sandwich was overflowing with meat.  Delicious and a little spicy.  She only finished half her sandwich.\\n\\nDefinitely coming back here. Great service and food.\", u\"YUM, YUM YUM!!!!.... Great vibes... Drinks & Food was delish and servers  were very nice. Came here on a couple occasions, large group or intimate- the setting is Perfect! They have a spacious area in the back for larger crowds, family style setting. Order the country fried steak meal, mac and cheese or busquits or all people! Lol Fresh, flavorful and  of course filling... lol whatever you choose I'm sure you won't be disappointed.\\n\\nHAVE FUN... ENJOY!!!\", u\"Divey bar serving comfort breakfast foods in the mornings. \\n\\nMy friend and I got a pitcher of mimosa for brunch which id like to say got me pretty drunk between the two of us. Yes, I'm one of those girls who enjoy brunch and drink at noon. It's a Saturday for goodness sakes - this is allowed by society so I part-take and indulge. Don't judge. \\n\\nIf you had a stressful weekday, come here on Saturday mornings. They've got booze to cure you and fried chicken & waffles to comfort your soul. I got what seemed like a healthy option, the Crosby, but you can literally taste the butter in which the English muffin was toasted on. I'm not mad about it and actually, quite enjoyed it. My fried onions and breakfast sausage were perfectly greasy and delicious on top of an already amazing butter-drenched English muffin. \\n\\nI got a good look at the bar and it was pretty well-stocked with gin and whiskey. I'm sure it gets pretty busy at night..\", u\"Very good food. Southern comfort cuisine in New York! Pleasant servers and good drinks. I'd come bank again! Oh and the country fried steak is delicious\", u\"This is my first time here, my boyfriend has been here before but he brought me here tonight (we are visiting from FL) and we are literally in heaven. Service was very good! Firstly, the happy hour here is a great deal! With any drink you purchase ($9 cocktails, $4 beers) (forgot how much wine was), you get either 6 oysters or a complimentary poutine. So my boyfriend ordered a beer and I had the Spring Time Ranch cocktail.....it was suuuuper good - Tequila based. So my boyfriend ordered 12 oysters which he enjoyed. So for dinner, we split the bone marrow, the duck wings, and the biscuits. I have to say, the biscuits were unbelievable. Hot and soft. The butter melted right as you put it on there. Ugh!!! Seriously, our faces were like this -  the wings were crispy on the outside, and AMAZING and TENDER on the inside. We're big fans of duck and those wings we're  \\n\\nStronnnnngly suggest every single one of those food items and the drink! Wish I could come back here anytime I wanted.\", u\"Brooklyn Star is quite possible one of the best restaurants in all of Brooklyn. This gem is situated near the Lorimer stop in Northern Williamsburg, and brings together the best of Brooklyn's restaurant scene. Stellar food, relaxing ambience, and friendly service. They almost always have seating available with large 4 person tables at the front, and a big backroom full of larger tables and booths. The price can get on the steeper side, depending on the dish, but the portions are pretty large, and all-in-all, this place is WELL worth every penny.\\n\\nThis was my 3rd or 4th time coming to Brooklyn Star, but it's almost always on point, and tonight was no exception. I met up with some friends for drinks and food. To start, two of us had the Juniper run cocktail (~$6 happy hour price from 4-7pm), which was gin, muddled strawberry, and I believe a citrus add-in, and my god was it refreshing. To be honest, I don't normally drink cocktails often but I'll definitely start at this place. We then ordered the cornbread and butter, which was fresh out of the oven and seemed to melt in your mouth. Seriously, such a good choice for an appetizer if you want to split a dish, but eat too much if you get full quickly, because the main entrees are where it's at.\\n\\nI try to be adventurous but I almost always go for the meatloaf sandwich with potato chips ($15) because it really IS that good. The sandwich comes with delicious, homemade meatloaf that's not too thick- but just enough to be hearty -in between two fluffy slices of bread. it also comes with a sauce, that I'm not familiar with, but adds a nice zing. The chips are a sizeable and seasoned side portion that complement the overall taste of the sandwich, without overpowering or heavy. My friends got the country fried steak and fried chicken family dinner (available on Sundays and Mondays), which are also to die for. That fried chicken tho. \\n\\nThis place pretty much hits every box on my checklist. Seriously, get to this place if you haven't already. Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in all of New York City.\", u'Brooklyn Star is where the Brooklyn hipster rediscovers their inner Southerner.  The service and food is friendly and efficient, and it deserves the fantastic score it already has.  \\n\\nI\\'ve visited The Brooklyn Star a number of times, and each time I\\'ve been greeted by a friendly server and a large bottle of water.  The bar sits at the front left side of the restaurant, and I\\'ve almost always sat in what I\\'ll call \"cocktail\" tables.  \\n\\nThis time, the bartender came to our table at one point and offered to make me a non-alcoholic drink...I was SO happy to have something delicious to make me feel like I was just like everyone else.  :-)  Not to mention, it was GREAT.  I don\\'t know his name, but it was on Monday, May 8th at 7:15pm.  \\n\\nMy friend Rachel and I shared the fried chicken dinner, and this is where I have to go a little down from five stars.  I LOVE southern food.  I\\'m from the South, and very little brings me as much comfort.  However, their version of Southern is always JUST a little off from perfect for me.  \\n\\nFor instance, the fried chicken wasn\\'t QUITE as good as the stuff I\\'ve had in Tennessee.  The collard greens are just a BIT too runny, the mac and cheese a bit too fancy, and the cornbread a pinch too brown.  It\\'s these little things that remind me that it\\'s Brooklyn\\'s version.  \\n\\nI won\\'t stop going here just because the food isn\\'t my version of perfect.  Such an amazing spot and TOTALLY worth a visit.', u'Came here for dinner around 7:30 and got seated right away. Food is awesome and portions are huge. I got the brick chicken which comes w/ 2 chicken thighs smothered in sweet tea glaze dressing over a bed of summer succotash. Very good. My friend got the country fried steak and it was also delicious. The flavored breading complimented the juiciness of the steak.', u\"Came here to try Pig Tails. Very bony. Came with pom pom potatoes which reminded of high school cafeteria. I don't think I will be coming back. See photo below.\", u'The skillet bread pudding & the kool- aid are a must have here. Grab a friend and an extra spoon and dig in. The biscuits are also very good.', u'This is a really great brunch if you are looking for very filling Southern Cuisine. I recommend the Ham Steak and the Cuban Style Breakfast Torta.\\n\\nI am a huge fan of their Cinnamon Buns and Buttermilk Biscuits.  \\n\\nIt is also really convenient for a late night pick up now. It is a definitely a constant in the neighbourhood with great food and great service.', u\"Located in a residential neighborhood in Brooklyn.  It has off opening hours which I've seen before so I expected the food and service to be excellent...... And I wasn't disappointed! \\nThe service was excellent! The bartender wasn't cheap w the liquor and was friendly.  The Mac n cheese was to die for. We added some honey on the cornbread w jalape\\xf1o which brought out more of the flavor. The fried steak w mash potato and gravy was scrumptious! \\nI'd definitely come back w friends the 2nd time around\", u'Beautiful place with friends and family i would recommend it to anyone.going to come back next weekend for sure just an amazing vibe.', u'The food, drinks and atmosphere is awesome!  I loved the gin cocktail, the grapefruit and the fried chicken.  The waffles were too soft for my liking but the biscuits were delicious, freshly baked and soft.', u\"The ambiance was great. I love the decor, seating was comfortable. Something about long wood bench tables in restaurants that makes it very homey.\\n\\nI came here for brunch and I got the chicken and waffle. I love chicken and waffle, althought it was not special, it was definitely not a let down. They don't skim on the chicken, I had three pieces on mine.  I thought the chicken can used a bit more of salt, but it was definitely juicy and tender, and well-fried. Waffle was a bit too soft for my taste, would like to see the side a bit more toasted and crunchier. But I want to highlight here that the star of the waffle was definitely the apple butter, it was so smooth and tastes great with the chicken and waffle. It was a perfect combination with a dash of hot sauce to balance out the sweetness of the waffle and the fried chicken. \\n\\nThe order also came with a candied grapefruit! So smart, perfect brunch addition. Sometimes chicken and waffle can get heavy, and you can freshen up and renew your taste bud with a taste of grapefruit. How smart is that.\", u\"Maybe I should had kept crossing the bridge, but there are so many restaurants to try and haven't had the chance to come and eat in Brooklyn. \\nWell fast forward to 2017 and it's been 5 years since I last came by and wow, things have changed a lot.\\n\\nI recently was reminded of this place, because I was Down Under and tried some Kangaroo Tail and I was like this is nothing like the Pig Tails back in Brooklyn.\\n\\nI hyped up this dish and I was like OMG, you have to try the Pig Tails at Brooklyn Star and so came here and BOOM - NO PIG TAILS on the menu.\\n\\nI said to my friends, well at least they have my other favourite thing, the KALE SALAD.\\n\\nI ordered two kale salads for four people, because I love this salad so much that I wouldn't think it would be enough to satiate me among four people.\\nThis salad has changed too - it is no longer julienne sliced kale that has been carefully massaged to become this delicious greenery that is topped with peanuts and small hits of cheddar bit crisp goodness.\\nIt is now baby kale with a big chunk of nasty over baked cheddar crisp and peanuts. I used to talk about this salad to everyone, but now.....I am mute.\\n\\nWe also got the CFS, mac and cheese with bacon, and hot meatloaf sandwich - all just okay, nothing extraordinary, but yes, this trip to Brooklyn was a major bummer.\\n\\nBubbles bursting - really sad about the pig tails and kale salad.\\n\\nIf it is not broke, why fix it?\\n\\nSpicy Margarita was good though.....\", u'The food was delicious I had chicken waffles and a glazed grapefruit. I never had grapefruit prepared like that before it was we very tasty and different. There was also no wait time and the restaurant was very spacious a lot brunch places in Brooklyn are very tight but it was a good size.', u\"This spot in East Willyb is another one that's on our rotation of brunch spots. You gotta be regularly churning out good eats to win a spot in our rotation. I am a fan of the hotcakes,  the fried chicken and waffles. Staff here keep things moving like a well oiled machine. Good spot!\"], u'149.BeeHive Oven Biscuit Cafe': [u\"Wow the service here is incredible! My friend got a drink she didn't like and immediately asked for a different cocktail and they exchanged them no problem! \\n\\nThen, they brought out the wrong meal for that same friend (oops lol) and so they left the wrong meal for us all to share AND comped her correct meal because since they make everything fresh, hers wouldn't be done for a hot minute. \\n\\nSo wow 10/10. \\n\\nTHEN THE FOOD. \\n\\nOkay two people got the chicken fried chicken. The mashed potatoes were soooo good. Definitely somebody's mom's recipe. A bit of texture and great flavor! \\n\\nAlso on the table: fried green tomatoes with an excellent remoulade. \\n\\nThe Alamo City - basically chicken and waffles. The waffles are shaped like Texas, super cute! The honey butter is like a raw honey syrup. So yummy. \\n\\nLastly, chicken fried steak. I felt like they leave the steak in the fryer a bit too long, but the grits were EXACTLY what we all needed. Like last if I could bring a giant order of those home, I would. \\n\\nAlso, three of us are from Texas and the other from Virginia. We're southerners, so this was really comforting. \\n\\nAbove all, the servers, chef, manager, everyone. Their staff is SO NICE. They deserve 10000 stars. \\n\\nWe'll be back!\", u\"I decided to give this place a try since I've heard so much hype around it and I was CRAVING some good creole cooking. I wasn't disappointed. \\n\\nMe and my boyfriend came on a Saturday night around 8pm and surprisingly it was pretty empty. Our server was very attentive and gave us suggestions to the most popular items on the menu. I decided to go with the Shrimp and Grits and my boyfriend opted for the Chicken Fried Steak. Being that I grew up in a southern household, I hold a certain standard when it comes to creole cooking. \\n\\nThe shrimp and grits for me were good, but not fantastic. The gravy and seasoning for the grits were great, but I can tell that the shrimp itself was barely (if not at all) seasoned. I ate every bit, but for me I probably would try something different next time. Now, I took a bite of my boyfriends chicken fried steak...and let's say one bite turned into a few. DAMN GOOD!! Packed with so much flavor that both me and him had to pause to indulge in all of its goodness at the first bite. If you're currently thinking of getting this, don't think, just order. \\nThe biscuits that came with both meals were also very delicious.\\n\\nOverall I will be making a return back to BeeHive (especially for that chicken fried steak).\", u\"Was debating whether this place gets 3 or 4 stars. The food was good when it eventually came out. Seems as though they make all to order so it's super fresh. \\nLet get down to the sausage biscuit and gravy... i have southern roots. It's Official... go get some. Bacon was thick cute and smoky.. delicious.\\nMy only complaint was the wait for the food to table and the size of this place. A little cramped but it's worth a visit\", u\"when you need to satisfy a craving for southern cooking at its best look no further and come eat at the Beehive. This is the place that will tickle your taste buds. If you come you must have the Grits and biscuits with mushroom gravy or just biscuits and jams, so goood.\\n\\nThis restaurant puts a twist on southern cooking . It's quite , cozy and very comfortable for a cute date. I ordered the Chicken and grits smothered  in mushroom gravy , and for the first time in life I received and order with enough chicken to balance out the meal . The meal as a whole was quite delicious. The chicken was crispy and season right. The grits were cooked well and were Smothered with a gravy sauce. My biscuit was crunchy but moist ,with butter on top. I also tried half of the chicken with eggs on a biscuit , and I must say it was quite scrumptious. I enjoyed my meal and this is my new go to spot. \\n\\nAmazing fast service even though it's a small spot.  The staff and servers were super nice and informative when I asked them for recommendations.  A bit cramped, but it's ok because there's fried chicken to warm your soul! \\n\\nThe food here is so good. The workers are all extremely friendly. Will continue to frequent this restaurant whenever I'm in the area. Great place with a southern and homey feel. The chicken here is flavorful and the real deal.\", u\"Early Birthday celebratory brunch this past weekend & as I sat there, I could not help wonder why have never attempted to visit this place before. Well, now I look forward to becoming a frequent visitor because the food was sooooooo on point! \\n\\nThe decor is very cute with a vintage feel. Our server was absolutely awesome! Our meals were delicious. \\n\\nI selected the chicken fried chicken, it was perfectly fried, moist, and not heavy, nor greasy. It was accompanied by a really good mash & a perfectly baked fresh biscuit. Oh and mushroom gravy, if you have been following my food reviews  by now you have noticed that I am not too friendly on the fungi lol  However, lately it has been making an appearance in many of my meals. We are getting along, well sort of, if I don't think about it being mushrooms I manage. The mushroom sauce the chicken is usually dressed with, I opted to have it on the side so, that I could try and strain out the physical mushroom pieces. I must say the sauce/gravy was very good. I also asked for the strawberry jam, it was very good as well. \\nMy husband and I shared a cocktail which was on the special menu board. It was a berry/lemon sangria I believe & ohhhh sooo delicious!!! \\nHe had a chicken biscuit. I can not recall the name with a side of elote corn. \\n\\nWell, if you like good southern comfort food, Bee Hive is the place to BEE!!!! Oh the buttermilk dip for the chips, what the what!!! Please, tell me how good you think it is?!!!!\", u\"Methinks not. I know one star is low. Here's why:\\n\\n1. Bad service - we waited a long time to sit down when we arrived...to a fairly empty restaurant. When we finally asked to just sit down at an empty spot, they asked us not to because they wanted to wipe it down, which you know is fine, but we really just wanted to sit down. We also accidentally spilled some water and apologized profusely, to which the waiter didn't respond which was off-putting. They also weren't helpful to the people beside us. When they asked if they were ordering enough food or not, they just responded that they were ordering two dishes so maybe...\\n\\n2. High prices small sizes - we're from the south and used to a biscuit costing cheaper and getting way more food.\\n\\n3. Messed up orders - they messed up the peoples orders on both sides of us.\\n\\n4. Uncomfortable environment - it was hot in the restaurant, our table was lopsided (hence the spilled water) and the bathroom wasn't very clean\\n\\nWon't be back... was surprised that it had such high reviews!\", u'Found this cute little place and decided to try it out. They make delicious chicken strips and cinnamon waffles (Texas State shaped!). The chicken was good, not dry - which is very important! The servers were soooo nice! Super friendly! They gave us a sample of their grits. \\n\\nIced coffee gets one free refill!', u'This place is a cozy and warm little breakfast spot with a very friendly staff. The brunch here from my experience is delicious but a little on the small side for the price. Also, they do have boozy options to go along with the brunch meal, unfortunately though it is not bottomless :(.... I highly recommend the french quarter for brunch, the biscuit, egg, jam and gravy combo is absolutely delicious!!', u\"Oh my God.....Becky, look at that biscuit. ...... I like big biscuits and I cannot lie. \\n\\nI'm so head over heels for this place. And not just because all the staff is super friendly, or that my food came out nice and piping hot, or because we got free chips with ranch sauce, or that the wait was not long, and although it was all of that, it's because the food is just that good! \\n\\nMy mother got a special of the day. Factory posted of fried salami, fried cheese sticks, mashed plantains, eggs, and a biscuit with ham. I got the chicken fried steak meal which came with bacon, a biscuit, gravy, and eggs. Out of this world amazing! I also got a prickly pear mimosa and my mom got a Aunt Betty special or something like that. Coffees too plus a slice of mockingbird cake. \\n\\nI can't wait to go back!!!\", u\"Think I found a new favorite for brunch!! Went for brunch on a recomendation.... a definite must try. Cute little corner spot in Williamsburg. Decor is eye catching. Great service with oh so pleasant staff. I had the special of the day....amazing... and my guest chose another just as tasty dish. GREAT homemade bisquits with freshly made preserves. Can't believe how fast the food came out of the kitchen and onto our table. Well made Mimosa and my Aunt Betty's Lemonade was delish. We were definitely full when we left. \\nThis place fills up fast so come early and pick your choice of seating.\", u\"Came at around 1:30 on a Saturday and there was a 20 min wait. Definitely add to the Yelp waitlist to save time! I had the playa dorado special, two eggs, home fries with onions and peppers, a sausage patty, and biscuit with jam, and a prickled pear mimosa. Friend ordered the chicken fried chicken, which came in a savory mushroom sauce. The food was really tasty - home fries are crisped to perfection. The strawberry homemade jam was a nice touch. The place is small, but it's got a cozy home-kitchen feel that isn't too hectic or crowded. Only thing is we ended up waiting around 30 mins for our food, even though there were only a few other parties left.\", u\"This was the worst experience I have ever had with any restaurant in my life! My food came up to over $30 and everything was cold and absolutely disgusting. There was nothing on my plate that was good! My chicken steak was burnt and tasted like nothing. The didn't even remember to put the gravy on my food! The mashed potatoes were ok and the biscuits were hard as a rock and cold! I will NEVER order from this place again!\", u'Where do I begin?!\\n\\nI walk in on a weeknight to an empty restaurant before a show at Baby\\'s All Right. Due to the surprisingly quiet vibe of the restaurant my waitress, Lily, was a fantastic server. She was super friendly and also helped me pick some amazing recommendations.\\n\\nI started with their Texas Mint Iced Tea. So refreshing and not too sweet. To start, they give you a small portion of homemade chips and a buttermilk sauce. I got the deviled eggs to start, at only 2 for $4! They had paprika and a variety of herbs mixed in for a tasty app. \\n\\nI felt obligated to try a biscuit, because why else would you go to a place that has biscuit in the name? So, I opted for \"The Charlotte\" which is an open faced biscuit topped with chicken stew, or as I like to think of it, an open chicken pot pie, yum!! It also came with a choice of a side and I decided to get the cheesy grits, also delicious!\\n\\nThen, I was having a weak moment and the dessert sounded way too good so I ordered the special caramel apple biscuit bread pudding topped with cinnamon ice cream.... It was gluttonous, but so delicious.  When I return I would love to try their shrimp and grits, make my own biscuit sandwich and the hummingbird cake. I love the Texas influence on this restaurant, it makes you feel like you\\'ve truly been transported from Williamsburg straight to Texas.\\n\\nTips: Brunch is extremely popular and may have a wait, so try Beehive at dinner instead! \\nTry to save room for dessert.\\nThey have 2-for-1 Narragansetts on Tuesday from 5-9pm', u\"I wound up here after waking up on my birthday and feeling like some fried chicken, biscuits and gravy! Quickly typing in southern brunch on Yelp led me here. \\n\\nWe got here around 1pm and luckily didn't have to wait. Kudos to this spot as they have the waitlist feature enabled on Yelp. Super nifty to check the waitlist time and get on the list! \\n\\nThe brunch menu is concise, has around 10-15 items on it total. Good mix of big plates and southern style breakfast. We started with a small order of jubilee wings and 2 deviled eggs. The jubilee wings were tender, crisp and tossed in some type of sweet/ spicy chutney. Oh and it came with a side of some of the best homemade buttermilk ranch! \\n\\nFor entrees I had the chicken fried chicken. Came with mashed potatoes, mushroom gravy and a biscuit. Mike had the shrimp and grits. Both were scrumptious and those biscuits-dense and light, packed with flavor. You get to pick from a variety of jams as well. \\n\\nDefinitely recommend stopping here if you're in the mood for some southern brunch.\", u'I popped in to Beehive during one of my trips to NY and had the pleasure of trying their shrimp and grits. It was soooooooo yum (I\\'ve been wanting to try it for a while to see what the hype was about), the desserts aren\\'t too bad (the cinnamon roll is made from the same dough as the biscuits so it\\'s a little dry), and the drinks have a unique flair.\\n\\nWhy the low rating?\\n\\nDuring my visit I decided, on the spot, I would host my birthday brunch here. Le sigh. Why are restaurants in Brooklyn so difficult when I\\'m trying to celebrate? While there I told my server my Birthday Brunch usually consists of a party of 8+ (never more than 11) she told me it wouldn\\'t be an issue and to simply call ahead at least a week in advance and they\\'d be happy to accommodate. \\n\\nThis year my group is 9. I called to make a reservation and was informed reservations are not accepted that I should \"just show up and see if there\\'s space.\" I informed the gentleman on the line that this was for a BDay celebration and \"showing up\" would mean a possibility of my entire party not being seated. I was answered with \"I know but we can\\'t take a reservation for brunch, only for the evening\" HUH?! I then informed him \"we\\'re a decent size group happy to meet any spending minimum. I simply want to celebrate with brunch here\" he told me to hold and he would check with his manager. After 2.5 seconds he returned and informed me brunch reservations are for 6 max. Ummmmm ok, 9 people can be accommodated in the evening in the same space but not early morning. Le Sigh.\\n\\nI prefer having brunch in Brooklyn bcz it\\'s part of my roots and feels good to go \"home\" but this experience is the nail in the coffin and I\\'ll cross the bridge into Manhattan, henceforth, where restaurants are more accommodating for groups and I always have a better experience.\\n\\nGood food. Good service. Terrible for hosting an outing.\\n____________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nReply to John:\\n\\nThank you for a prompt response. The call this morning was as a courtesy to inform you, as the manager, that the staff shouldn\\'t tell guests the restaurant would be able to accommodate an event when it\\'s unable to. As someone who likes to plan ahead, making these plans 6 months in advance is what makes this experience most disconcerting. I found the food at Beehive interesting and wanted to try the entire menu. This event was the opportunity to do so, which would allow for a more thorough review. Plans that were made, based solely on the advice of a server that is no longer employed there, now need to be changed last minute which limits options.\\n\\nThank you for the Birthday wishes! :)', u'Last October, I came to BeeHive Oven Biscuit Cafe with my boyfriend and friends. I knew about this restaurant through classmates. I really liked Beehive Oven and not because I love brunch, but because the Texas inspired restaurant is a true gem! It\\'s a cozy, comfortable spot with an upbeat staff. The restaurant is a little small with limited seating, so not quite ideal for a huge group.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t know already or haven\\'t been here, the star of Beehive Oven is really their biscuits which are served in a variety of different ways. Every meal at Beehive Oven Biscuit Cafe comes with a complimentary appetizer of homemade vegetables and buttermilk ranch dressing. Who doesn\\'t like something that is FREE?\\n\\nWe ordered the following items:\\n\\nThe Fried Green Tomatoes with Spicy Remoulade was a menu item I wanted to try out. The fried green tomatoes were fried to perfection, golden and delicious. I was expecting to taste or feel the juices of the tomatoes, but didn\\'t.\\n\\nOur friends ordered the Jezebel Wings with buttermilk dressing. You can get these three for $8.00 or 6 for $15.00. I\\'m not a huge fan of wings, but these wings were extremely delicious and tasty. The wings had a slight sweet and tangy taste to it which I liked. \\n\\nThe side order we had was the Fried Okra. The fried okra was fried to a golden perfection like the fried green tomatoes. It was mediocre. It wasn\\'t anything too special in my opinion.\\n\\nOne friend had the Shrimp and Grits. The shrimp was bathed in a creamy Cajun sauce with bacon on a bed of grits. I was going to order the shrimp and grits until I saw the word \"Cajun\". This dish screams dangerously hot to me, but our friend enjoyed it. It also looked very filling.\\n\\nMy friend\\'s boyfriend and I had the same dish: Chicken-Fried Steak and Eggs- tenderized beef steak breaded and fried topped with mushroom gravy, two eggs, and a biscuit with jam. Beehive Oven was serving pumpkin biscuit the day we visited the restaurant so we swapped out the original biscuit with the biscuit of the day and also choose whichever jam is available. choose the vanilla pear jam.\\n\\nThe chicken fried steak and eggs is a very heavy entree and worth the $17. The grits were cooked perfectly and had a delightful buttery taste to it. I\\'ve never had a chicken fried steak before so this was my first time. It was extremely delicious, cooked to nothing but perfection! It was golden, crispy, and tasty. The mushroom gravy was BOMB! I love anything with mushrooms. I got my eggs over-easy and over-easy they were! I\\'ve never been a fan of biscuits, but I am a fan of pumpkin so I gave it a shot. I thought the biscuit was a little dry, definitely not the best I\\'ve had.\\n\\nMy boyfriend had the Texas Hot Brown - open-faced biscuit sandwich with turkey, bacon, and sliced tomato topped with sausage gravy. He couldn\\'t swap his biscuit with a pumpkin biscuit since it\\'s part of the sandwich already. His dish also looked quite heavy, but it looked amazing! The sausage gravy looked and tasted amazing. \\n\\nThe eating didn\\'t stop there, because we also got dessert. We ordered the Cinnabiscuit - a warm biscuit cinnamon bun topped with a choice of vanilla, chocolate, or caramel glaze. We chose the caramel glaze. We also ordered the Homemade Cinnamon Ice Cream. The cinnabiscuit was amazing! It was warm, sweet, moist, and delicious. You can taste cinnamon and caramel deliciousness all over. We actually scooped a chunk of the biscuit with a bit of ice cream which created a great combination!\\n\\nOverall, I liked Beehive Oven Biscuit Cafe a lot. It felt very homey, and like a nice place you can come to enjoy and relax on the weekend. I love the delicious Southern comfort food that they have to offer. I definitely want to come back again to try more of their savory and sweet foods.\\n\\nHooray to another spot that satisfies my taste buds in Williamsburg!', u'Food is good but expensive. I visited Beehive for breakfast and was surprised when I got a 0 bill for chicken and waffles and biscuits with gravy. After the tip, I spent over 0, for breakfast.', u\"BeeHive you been on my hit list for a while cause who doesn't love a biscuit. \\n\\nFor starters we had the fried green tomatoes and the complimentary chips and dip.  The chips were homemade and good along with the salsa.  The fried green tomatoes left a lot to be desired to me they weren't as seasoned or Crispy as I would have like to be clear the breading wasn't Crispy and didn't adhere well to the tomato.  And the tomato itself was too firm if that makes any sense. And I love fried green tomatoes so that hurt.  \\n\\nFor biscuits I had the Moselle which was Devine my egg was overlooked though so I didn't get that gooey ooze I was looking for but still enjoyed the sand which not sure it's really had friendly either my biscuit broke up on bite one.  Not mad at all about that it just changed it to a knife and fork meal \\nMy company had the fried chicken biscuit with sausage gravy they loved it just asked for more gravy on the side.  I had a side of grits which were tasty but a rad too watery I kept finding some on my chin lol.\\n\\nLastly they only serve wine and beer so I opted for one of their signature cocktails that boasted prosecco and the waitress said would be the stronger drink boy was she wrong or maybe I'm an alcoholic (don't judge me). I didn't rates any liquor nor did I feel it.  But the drink was cute and tasty.  \\n\\nFor these reasons I had to give you a 3 but I'm not deterred I will return and try different things and I will recommend you to friends.\\n\\nYelp check in of 20% off your bill\", u\"Cute little breakfast/brunch spot that's got a Texas theme going on ya'll. Saw the hype on Yelp and had to check out the place with the wife.\\n\\nOrdered:\\n\\nMichelada - I felt it wasn't spicy enough for my liking and I admit that was probably my fault by not asking for it extra spicy but I think the beer also fell a bit flat in the mixture (they use Lone Star beer). \\n\\nThe Pearl - after reading the description on the menu it just screamed my name and it was definitely tasty but I was a tad bit disappointed with the size of both the biscuit and the chicken which left me wanting more.  \\n\\nThe wife went the way of building her own biscuit which is a great way to satisfy those who want it all. The specialty jam was pretty unique (I can't remember the exact offering she picked but do know it was something we both had never tried/seen on a menu) and she also ordered a side of the 4 cheese mac.\\n\\nThere aren't a ton of seats inside so expect a wait when they get busy but once you are sat it's not too packed. It's a clean place with an interesting menu that's worth checking out if you're in the area.\", u\"Oh my ... BEST sausage gravy. We walked 5 miles to get to this place and it was totally worth it! If you are from the south, living in the Northeast, you MUST try this place. If you are not from the south and would like to taste good southern food, you must try this place. It's a crime to live in New York and not go to BeeHive Oven for breakfast at least once!\"], u'207.Sunken Hundred': [u'We came here for Sunday Brunch and really enjoyed our experience. I really like the interior, and the staff were extremely welcoming. The food was amazing - I had the house made corned beef hash and my friend had the pancakes, both were exceptional. The mimosa was very tasty and the coffee came as a French press which I loved. We did not feel rushed and were able to have a great meal, it almost felt like we were at home. Will definitely come again!', u\"I'll be honest with you, I don't know anything about Welsh cuisine. I didn't even know the Welsh had a cuisine. \\n\\nWhile we're being truthful, I stole a t-shirt from Levi's when I was in 8th Grade. Also, before I actually came into this place, I walked by three or four times, looked at the menu, decided I didn't like the sound of anything, and went somewhere else.\\n\\nThat was my bad (the shoplifting and the fact that I avoided Sunken Hundred for so long).\\n\\nBecause Sunken Hundred is awesome. First of all, it's a great little bar. It's nicer than I initially thought inside, the cocktails are boozy and well-balanced, and the bartenders and servers are all cool. But all that Welsh food that didn't sound so appetizing? Turns out it's pretty delicious.\\n\\nThey'll start you off with some fried seaweed puffs, which is a nice introduction because they seem to throw seaweed in a lot of stuff. For starters, it's in the fantastic mustard you get with the Glamorgan Croquettes (the Welsh answer to mozzarella sticks, or whatever your fried cheese of choice is), and it's in the ketchup with the well fried chips too. \\n\\nThe menu isn't extensive, but what we've tried has been pretty solid. The watercress and arugula salad is properly seasoned, covered with shaved cheese (always a good move), and a favorite. There's always a seasonal gratin on the menu, and it's also a winner. It seems like they know what they're doing back there.\\n\\nThe only drawback for me was that personally, I think the Ffagodau (not pronounced how you might imagine) could've used a lot more onion gravy, and a bit more seasoning on the meatballs. But nobody's perfect. Not even the Welsh.\", u'My favorite restaurant in NYC. Great atmosphere. Wonderful staff, and the food is incredible. Try the Welsh rarebit.', u\"So a few friends and I decided to check this place out for their Sunday brunch, I never had Welsh food before so sure. It was basically English food with a few small tweeks, basically the tweeks were things I never heard of like rashers, creampog, rarebit, etc. I enjoyed my brunch and the setup was interesting and the restaurant decor was simple yet warm. It seems like a cool neighborhood hangout, it's not fancy but very chill.\\n\\nThe food:\\n\\nSunken Hundred Burger- Beef and dulse patty, sea urchin cream, buttermilk fermented cabbage with chips and fresh sea urchin. So apparently my friends know me well, Steph C knew I was going to order this even before I arrived. Of course I was going to order this since it has Uni! SO going in, I was super skeptical since yes, I do love Uni but on a burger it seemed super weird. In terms of the burger itself, it was really well executed. The burger was cooked perfectly, it was perfectly med rare and the texture of the beef was fantastic, they really know how to cook a burger. The brioche bun was a nice bun and I enjoyed the flavor but the bun did get a little greasy from the juices of the burger. I really enjoyed the buttermilk slaw but it was a tad too aggressive against the burger, I felt it was taking the focus a little away from the burger. The uni, while visible, wasn't really a flavor you could really pick up. The seaweed addition was unique, I never had seaweed on a burger before and it was good, different, but good. The fries were solid, nice and crunchy without being too greasy. Overall, a very good burger, in terms of the Uni addition, I say it's not really a difference maker. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zjPPxEKl9hioFUBzkMiCng&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\", u\"The last time I visited, they had only opened for a month. Nevertheless, Sunken Hundred was packed and its patrons were warm and boisterous. The menu is not too expansive, so if you come in a group, you could potentially order everything (which we did). Prior to visiting Sunken Hundred, I was not aware that seaweed played a large role in Welsh cuisine, but I 'shorely' did after eating here. It is literally incorporated into cocktails and nearly every single dish. \\n\\nI would definitely recommend the seafood cawl for an authentic glimpse into Welsh food. The seafood broth is rich, but delightfully light at the same time. A giant smear of silky seaweed is placed onto the rim of the bowl (not going to lie, it looked like something else at first glance). The hake was skillfully prepared (good for them for using sustainable fish!), tender and buttery in every bite. Of all of the offerings on the whole menu, I would recommend skipping the gratin, pat\\xe9, and the meatballs (all satisfactory, but not memorable).\", u\"Closer to a 3.5/5 overall. A friend of mine had been talking about coming here for weeks, and we were all excited to try out a Welsh restaurant for the first time, especially based on the fantastic Yelp reviews. Two out of the three of our group had already eaten, so we ordered small plates and drinks.\\n\\nFood:\\n3/5\\n\\nGlamorgan Croquettes: I really liked these, and think the mustard they're served with really rounds out the dish\\n\\nHouse Pate: A pretty classic Pate, nothing too exciting. It came with two slices of bread, which meant we had a lot of pate leftover. \\n\\nBraised leeks: Actually may have been my favorite part of the meal. Earthy and sharply acidic, these paired fantastically with the slightly heavier dishes we ordered. \\n\\nChips: The fries themselves were good, but I just couldn't bring myself to enjoy the seaweed ketchup. Perhaps it's a function of being raised on Heinz, but any other ketchup sort of tastes wrong. Seawood taste aside, the texture of the ketchup was also just a little too gloopy. \\n\\nRazor clams- I love razor clams, and these were perfectly done, but they had one big problem: sand. I had a few bites that were properly cleaned, but a couple other ones were so sandy, they left sand on my plate that later got onto my leeks. If the sand wasn't an issue, this would have been an amazing dish. \\n\\nSauteed squid- The combination of squid, almonds, and apricots was something completely new for me and I really enjoyed it. The texture of the squid itself was a little hit or miss- I'd say about 2/3 of the pieces were amazing, and 1/3 were too chewy. Not quite sure what happened there. The romesco sauce was a great finish. \\n\\nBaba Bryth- We had a bit of a split at the table on this desert. My boyfriend really loved it, but I personally found it too sweet for my taste. If you like cakes with raisins and dried fruits, then you will likely love this desert. The candied walnut ice cream it's served with is fantastic. \\n\\nDrinks:\\n4/5\\nI had a glass of the Muscadet, and my friends had cocktails which they said were good, but not great.\\n\\nService:\\n4/5\\nIt took us a little while to get plates and utensils (it was after we got our food) but our waitress was kind and enthusiastic.\\n\\nAmbiance:\\n3/5\\nThis restaurant was LOUD. I found myself having to half shout for my boyfriend on the other side of the table to be able to hear me. But, the music playing was fun, always love some Bowie at the dinner table. \\n\\nOverall, it felt a little pricy for what we got. I'm glad we tried it out, but we probably won't be back anytime soon.\", u'In all the chaos and craziness of a big city, the Sunken Hundred is a reminder that pride and passion for what you do and believe in can deliver great results. The owner and staff were friendly, interested and engaged. The menu not over complicated offering good balance of seafood and meat dishes. The Welsh accents, from the owner to the pictures and bar design are subtle and surprisingly charming. Well worth a visit.', u'I\\'m from Los Angeles, and I\\'m a huge pain in the ass about how food in New York is not too exciting. Sunken Hundred though, is one of my favorite restaurants in the world. Their food is consistently creative, adventurous, and most importantly, fucking delicious. I love their willingness to use strange ingredients -- like oysters in tartare or ice cream on pork or uni with their burgers -- and how fucking well they pull it off. It\\'s wonderful and surprising and in ways I\\'d expect from those snotty \"haute cuisine\" type places, but it\\'s still satisfying and the portions are generous. The service is similarly superlative and personal, and the whole operation feels like a family run affair. Ive been here four times, including for Valentine\\'s Day dinner, and it has been consistent every time. \\n\\nAlso the owner (or at least I think he is the owner) plays excellent shoegaze music, like Cocteau Twins and My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive, so you know this guy fucks.', u'If you asked me the difference between Welsh, Scottish and English cuisine, I might say they\\'re all the same, but Sunken Hundred blows every other English and Scottish spot out of the water.\\n\\nI loved everything about this restaurant--from the amazing service (and some of the friendliest staff), the animated owner who made his rounds to all the tables, the creative use of seaweed (try the signature cocktail, but I would share one with someone adventurous) to the incredible food. Plus happy hour during the week with free Welsh \"cheese doodles,\" which are so addicting. \\n\\nThe people who work here are passionate about Welsh culture and food, and their hard work definitely shows. This is absolutely a place I\\'ll be visiting again and again.', u\"One star for good and fun service, the rest was simply terrible.\\nWe were a group of 5. Their menu is so limited we ended up ordering a lot of the same dishes...all tasteless. Just read their menu, it's already unappetizing, but you always hope they will make a nice tasty dish out of it, nope. As unappetizing as it sounds, exactly that.\\nTheir drinks menu seems fun and we tried almost all of them, there was only one that stood out, the rest were just poorly prepared, we ended up ordering classic drinks for our second round which were way better than their signature cocktails.\", u\"Ugh I'm so sad to give this place 2 stars because I was so excited about trying it out. I lived in Wales for 2 years and love everything about the place, especially the people. I came here on a Saturday night at 11.30 and the lights were on full and 2 different people who work there made us feel like we weren't welcome. Maybe it closes at midnight and I'm not aware? Anyway the walls are kinda sparse - not even a Welsh flag or love spoon or anything that made me think this place is owned by welsh people. A flag of St David yes but nothing else. Not even a dragon in sight! \\nThere was no real ambience either. As I said, maybe they were closing and that's why the lights were full blast. I know it's just opened so hopefully it's a work in progress.\", u'Lovely restaurant and bar. Warm, friendly and very cool owner and staff. Recently we held a family party here and the owners were enthusiatic and welcoming hosts, even creating a special menu for the event. Food was delicious and service was excellent. Everyone in our sprawling family, across three generations, greatly enjoyed.  Previously, we brought our school-age kids for brunch and early dinner  - there were enough kid-friendly items and touches to keep the young ones happy - while we were able to enjoy an adult pub atmosphere.', u\"Was advised by Yelp marketing e-mail about this new restaurant opening up in my area, so my companion and I decided to take a chance, listen to the marketing, and give it a whirl.\\n\\nWe visited on a Monday night, perhaps not the best night to sample a restaurant's wares.  The room was too bright, always a giant negative for me, and sparsely populated.  But we were able to secure a corner table in its own little cubbyhole, which was welcome.  \\n\\nAfter a bit of a wait, our server appeared, a somewhat distracted young lady, who took our drink orders and then proceeded to send me the wrong drink.  I decided to be quiet about it and I drank it anyway.  But it was a bad sign.\\n\\nFor starters we had the homemade scones with mackerel seaweed butter.  The scones looked and tasted like Costco exports and the butter was just very salty and fishy butter.  Nothing impressive about it at all.   We didn't finish the dish.  It was just too salty.  We also ordered the warm mushroom salad, which was much better - unusual and tasty - but also a tad salty.  It just didn't need that extra spoonful of salt.\\n\\nFor the main course, my companion ordered the mussels, which were fine.  Hard to get those wrong, and they delivered.   I order the Summer Seafood Cawl, mostly because it sounded so unusual and I liked the name.  My mistake.  After a very very long wait, the entrees arrived.  \\n\\nWhat was presented to me was a bowl containing a sluice of grey broth containing seafood bits and clams in shells, with a stain of seaweed slime on one side of the bowl, plus some soggy bread slathered in a yellow paste and submerged partways into the grey sluice.   I wasn't completely put off yet, game to try new things, so I dug in.\\n\\nTo make a long story short, my order was basically low tide stew.  Completely inedible.  Incredibly salty.  Wholly unappetizing in flavors and in textures. I could not finish it.\\n\\nVery disappointing.  It was just a terrible meal.  I wonder if this place will be here in a year.\", u\"Cozy place with nice soft atmosphere, it felt good as soon as i sat down. The owner and waitstaff are all extremely funny and accomodating and i came with an infant and stroller, mind you. so much that i gave extra star for service. I came with a medium sized group so we ordered a couple of things on the menu. Im neither a cheese lover nor your lamb neighbor, so I'll skip rating those and highlight my two dishes of the night. Razor clams are a must if you come by. These razor clams were steamed so beautifully with all the juices still intact inside them, flavored light n just right. And if youre a razor clam eater, you'll know how thorough they need to be cleaned and there was no slacking there. Their seafood cawl is also delicious, broth heavy in seafood flavor, the rouille and laver leaves u licking your fingers. I couldve used more bread there just to polish off that broth. And lastly to warn you, their fried seaweed snack becomes addictive. My only complaint is that theyre a bit on the pricey side for their portion of food, esp the mussels. All in all, good for a mingle. Maybe ill be back for that squid.\", u\"The uni burger was delicious.  I would definitely come back.  The waitress was helpful and very cheery ( I'm not being sarcastic) . \\nConvenient spot... not far from the G train.\", u'Blimey! Cyffrous! Excitingly Delicious! \"SUNKEN HUNDRED\" Is indeed a Treasure founded in the Pembrokeshire waters of Wales\\' Great Barrier Reef and brought over to Brooklyn\\'s Restaurant\\'s Row on Smith Street by two Welsh brothers named Illtyd & Dom. \\nOr as I like to respectively call them, Rod Stewart & David Bowie. The rest of the group is made up of Their Delightfully, Warm, Friendly Staff: Clementine, The Pretty Nerd, Tory, The Beautiful Tall Drink Of Water, Sarah & Jeff the Mixologist who together with me introduced a new refreshing cocktail to the place. \\nWe called it the V2 and/or The Vinny. The Chef, Tom is a culinary genius his cuisine is out of this World! It will tantalize your senses to the point of ecstasy!\\nBon Appetit! ~VINCENT~', u\"Sunken Hundred, a new Welsh restaurant, is a dream restaurant for seaweed fans. I'm not sure if there are any seaweedphiles, but if so, make haste to this new restaurant. Instead of bread, the restaurant offers complimentary dishes of fried seaweed fritters, which taste like spicy Cheetos with a faint green tang. They are delicious. Seaweed also appears in cocktails, ketchup, as a garnish in main dishes, etc. Apparently Wales is all about seaweed. I like seaweed, so this was just fine with me. \\n\\nAside from the seaweed, this is a very nice spot.  It has a welcoming atmosphere - there are two cute little snug tables by the front windows, a comfortable bar, and very friendly hosts and servers. Had a good strong cocktail (the one with ginger tea) that was not too sweet. I didn't have the seaweed drink.\\n\\nFood is tasty and reasonably priced, Had the two salads (one mushroom, the other green), the seafood cawl (stew), the french fries, and the scone, with mackerel-seaweed (of course) butter. Everything was good - the scone and fries especially so.  The only thing I would say on the less positive side is that everything is quite salty. (Ironically, the fries were the least salty dish.) I like salt, but if you don't, this restaurant is not for you. Perhaps it's due to all the seaweed.\", u\"Wow!  Awesome place.\\nWelsh food?  Yep, it's true.\\nI was in Brooklyn for a quick trip  (to see Bob Weir ); so glad I found Sunken Hundred thru Yelp.\\nWe had a selection of small plates and sharables.  All excellent.   Squash dish.  Meatballs.  Calamari. Yum yum yum!\\nGreat martini too.  Highly recommended.\", u\"We came in during the week for dinner and were seated at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and we had a couple of drinks while we looked over the menu. Before we ordered she brought out a tasty seaweed funnel cake type snack that was absolutely delicious. \\n\\nUnfortunately, everything after was a complete miss. We ordered the seafood cawl and expected a hearty stew (as described), but what we got was a few spoons of green bland liquid mixed with small bits of unidentifiable seafood. Wasn't even edible. They were out of the razor clams so we opted for the calamari instead. It was a tiny portion and very chewy, which is surprising because calamari is pretty hard to screw up. The mushroom salad was just ok - very salty. I hate writing bad reviews, but we don't get out much and just hate wasting the night on a bad meal. One star for friendly service and the other for the delicious bar snack.\", u\"Oh boy, my love for this place is intense!\\n\\nWent with a friend and we both weren't really sure what to expect (Welsh food = ???). But we were truly blown away! First off, our server was so friendly and made us feel really at home! We both ordered cocktails and loved our respective ones (I got one with rye and apricot that was really tasty). Also treated to the most amazing complimentary snack, what I would describe as 'seaweed puffs'. OMG - they were SOOOO GOOD! Our server kept refilling them as the night went on and I probably could've eaten them forever.\\n\\nFor dinner, decided to split a few things so ordered: the croquettes, mushroom salad and meatballs. All three were delectable. Really interesting and yummy. \\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the Bara Bryth, which was also different and scrumptious. \\n\\nI really can't wait to come back here! It was such a relaxing experience and all the food surprised me! Great value too. For the two of us with two drinks, three dishes and dessert, I think it ended up being $80 with tip.\"], u'24.Koko Ramen': [u\"I'm giving this place five stars on the ramen alone. Great, complex broth and perfect noodles - springy with a little bite. Spicy miso was such a treat, even the chashu was cooked nicely. \\n\\nHappy hour is a great deal, you get a little appetizer with your ramen bowl and they have drink specials. Wings were pretty good, and gyoza were standard frozen, but cooked perfectly. \\n\\nDefinitely the closest I've found to the kind of local ramen joint you find everywhere in Tokyo. Will return!\", u'HARD PASS!\\n\\nSo this review is on everything from the starters to the ramen to the service.\\nLet me just jump to the ramen...it was good but I just can\\'t get pass the horrible starters. It literally put a damper on the whole evening. Honestly, I just wanted to get my money back and walk out of there. I ordered the wings which is priced at about ($7). It literally looked like the wings I get from the Chinese Restaurants with a nice dressing. Okay whatever, I took a bite and found that it was red. I took another bite of a different wing, same results. At this point, I\\'m disgusted because seriously why are the insides of my chicken wings red.\\nI told the waitress and she comes back (with the plate of wings)later like well you bit them so there\\'s nothing we can do. Logically speaking, yes I did bite them that\\'s why I know that it is red inside. She proceeds then to ask me what does she want me to do with them with said wings in hand. I literally told her to take them and I wanted to walk out at that moment which looking back I should\\'ve. \\nAlso, my friend who is vegan ordered the veggie bun which she inquired about before she ordered them. Yep, they gave her a bun with mayonnaise on it. So she wasn\\'t too please either.\\nSo we are both annoyed at this point. The ramen was good. The noodles were just how I like it. They could\\'ve done better with the pork belly though. It was just soft fat; I prefer some firmness. Will I go back? HARD PASS. This is NYC. There\\'s too many good places to eat and they completely turned me off. I would\\'ve given them 2 stars but to be fair the actual ramen was good but just \"good\".', u\"Meh.\\n\\nThey don't take cards but the Spanish restaurant that they also own and share a kitchen with does. Said shared kitchen has a door that opens up to the sidewalk, street dust probably blowing in. Saw a guy in there fiddling with his cellphone, with no gloves on; probably got Candy Crush all over my gyoza. Then again, that likely should have helped the flavor. But it didn't. Bland dumplings. My ramen was also flavorless. Ordered the shoyu broth based ramen, which comes with only pork belly and spinach and the customary egg + extra chicken. Honestly, could barely find the noodles or the meat. They were so unbelievably stingy with the extra chicken, which at an extra $3, I should have seen at least a whole cutlet and not cheap ass random shards. Speaking of cheap ass, I ordered the rose (yes ordering wine at a ramen shop is a set up...don't judge me)...what actually came to the table was a glass of kool aid. Isn't rose a blush???\\n\\nUgh. Mazui.\", u\"looked like a pretty good ramen place so stopped in for dinner. the place filled up pretty quickly. we ordered the duck special ramen and the pork belly shoyu ramen. the shoyu and duck ramen broths were salty - but lacked depth. tasted like soy sauce mixed with water. the pork belly was tasty and fairly thick compared to other places. the noodles were not enough ration. it was maybe two to three big bites. we also tried 3 of the buns for appetizers. duck, shrimp, and pork belly. they were ok, nothing to write about. since we werent full, we ordered lava cake for dessert. when i think of lava cake i want the middle to leak out when its cut, but it was a solid cake. extremely dense and chocolatey - more like an orbit cake. unfortunately wont be back anytime soon, although i do. wish we tried the koko ramen which is tonkatsu broth. i know this is nyc, but they served water straight from the sink and i'd at least want a level of filtration. it was also freezing inside and ramen places typically have hot green tea to serve. none here. there was one server taking orders and dashing around, she was nice but we were starving and it took quite long for ramen to come out the kitchen.\", u'Delicious! Been longing for a good tonkotsu ramen and this really hit the spot. Luckily they had spicy oil for me to add to it. Shrimp bun was very tasty as well and not too heavy.', u\"Cozy space with friendly and attentive staff with good ramen! Get the tonkotsu with thick noodles. The default noodles that it comes with are the skinny ones and those are not even half as good as the thick noodles. Wish I knew that before ordering, but at least next time I'll know!\", u\"Appetizers were great. Ramen was a disappointment.\\n\\nLoved the chicken wings and the duck bun and the pork belly bun. I only wish they weren't so pricy. I would order 4 or 5. If you can only pick one- go for the pork belly.\\n\\nI ordered the KoKo Tonkotsu ramen. The broth was just disappointing. It wasn't the rich & almost creamy broth you expect when you hear Tonkotsu. I've had Tonkotsu from various different Ramen spots (fancy to hole in the wall) and boy this one tasted alot like the broth you get in those cup noodles. It was very salty and watery.  \\n\\nPerhaps the other Ramen on the menu will taste better. I'm not sure if I'll return there again.\", u\"Stumbled onto this place because we were close. Okay, the gyoza, buns (shrimp and pork) and spicy miso ramen was really damn good. We were the only customers here and while the food took longer than I thought it should, I realized this place shares space (and likely a kitchen) with Manchego next door (that's another review).\\n\\nSo yes, surprisingly good, small spot, we were happy with our food, the menu is limited but everything I tried was damn good.\", u\"I've read through the bad reviews, but based on my experience tonight, Koko Ramen is a solid spot.\\n\\nThe ramen broth is very tasty, in particular the KoKo tonkatsu (broth is a bit more heavy/dense compared to the others).\\n\\nThe spicy miso is also flavorful and has a kick, but not too spicy.\\n\\nThe pork belly provided in both of the above is very tasty. \\n\\nNote: The tonkatsu noodles are skinner and straight, different from traditional, thicker, wavy noodles. They taste the same but have a different texture (see photo).\\n\\nThe ramen bowls are $14 (could be a few bucks cheaper). The food is delicious, the decor is lovely and the staff are very attentive/kind -- so I'm happy to pay for the great food and overall experience.\\n\\nDefinitely worth a stop in, especially on a cold night!\", u'LOVED their garlicky Edamame. The spicy miso ramen was also very good. The place was pretty quiet while I was eating, but they had some soft music playing and I enjoyed sitting at the window and people-watching while I slurped my ramen and munched my edamame. If I lived closer I would eat here probably every week!', u\"Warm and hospitable service, this was my second time enjoying ramen. \\n\\nFresh and delectable, we tried some of the most popular soup dishes (unfortunately don't recall the names). \\n\\nUnsure if ramen just isn't my thing or what, it was ok. Service was great.\", u'Ordered the duck bun and the tonkotsu ramen. The duck bun was pretty good, loved the crispy duck and the fluffy bun. The ramen was OK, the pork belly was tasty but the noodles and the broth were not my favorite. The broth was too strong and tasted like it had a lot of msg whereas the noodles were sticking and lumped together.', u\"Hands down the best ramen place in NYC \\nI'm like com on you want to eat it all and everyday \\nThe service is perfect the staff is professional helpful without been to overwhelming with questions (every two second are you ok )\\nI'm going to say the only down part is they only accept cash but once you taste them\\nRamen you will forgive them \\nMy favorite is the seafood ramen\", u'LOVE this place! Came here last night after driving by it almost every day and I wish I had tried this place out sooner! \\n-Ordered the spicy ramen bowl($14) and a duck bun($7)  it was so amazing. Noodles cooked perfectly, all the meat was tender, and the spice was just enough.\\n-the service was great and everyone was very friendly. The place is small though so a table of 4 is a lot to accommodate there. \\n\\n**CASH ONLY**', u\"This little neighborhood ramen place is cute and cozy; the food is great; and the service is truly wonderful. The waitstaff--especially Vera (who just left, unfortunately) and Pete--are always so kind and accommodating to our family, always remembering our regular order and making sure our 4-year-old daughter gets special kid chopsticks and fast service. Our visits here are always a pleasure--we feel so lucky to have found such a warm and welcoming place so close to home. And although it's a great place for kids, it's definitely not just a family restaurant--it's a great place for dates or dinner with friends, with a wonderful happy hour special.\", u'Charming, quaint place for some Ramen. I checked it out on a whim and no regrets. Cash Only though, so make sure your pockets have some coin in them. Great place for a contemplative solo meal or nice date. Staff here is very friendly.', u\"So delicious! We were super impressed by the depth of flavor in the ramen broth. We also had the wings, bao buns and gyoza and they were all super yummy. Service was great. My kids even loved it! Overall awesome experience. Get cash before hand--they're cash only!\", u\"This place is a diamond in the rough.\\n\\nThe place is small, only seats around 20 people-all 2 and 4 tops but we went on a Sunday in the late afternoon and had no problem being seated. \\n\\nWe had the wings, gyoza and the bao bun to start. Wings were crispy with some yummy sweet glaze drizzled over them. Gyoza was wonderfully cooked with a crispy fried bottom. The bun was pork belly that was perfect (not too chewy or fatty). \\n\\nOur entre was the chicken bowl (can't remember the name) and it was great! Noodles we're perfectly done and broth was SO good and had a wonderful authentic fish taste to it.\\n\\nService was good, feed came out fast and we had a nice time. \\n\\nWill go back again!\", u\"I was really excited that Koko Ramen opened in Ditmas Park. While I enjoy Bashi Channel (our other walking distance ramen destination), I was hoping Koko would be more traditional with other Japanese fare. \\n\\nAnd for the most part it is. Koko ramen, while having a standard gamut of ramen options, also has standard Japanese sides and fun ramen shop snackies. \\n\\nPROS:\\nBasic menu of ramen and Japanese treats\\nBao bun snackies are pretty on point and don't bust the bank.\\nNice clean, simple interior. Doesn't invite you to sit and stay for hours, but is good for a chat with an old friend over some slurping.\\nCONS\\nRamen isn't stellar, just the usual. Broth was seasoned but didn't feel like it was holding flavor, if that makes sense.\\nCASH ONLY. Why Brooklyn why? This always requires me leaving before the bill and after my meal to go withdraw the amount of money I spent. Square makes it so easy to accept a card.\\n\\n\\nMIXED BAG:\\nNot my preferred noodles but my eating mate loved them.\", u\"My only complaint about this hidden gem JUST off Courtelyou is that I didn't discover it until a couple of weeks ago despite living only two blocks away for the entire period that it has been open. Authentic Japanese cuisine only slightly Americanized. A chic bistro, neat decor, warm and attentive service. I don't agree with the picky reviews by people who fancy themselves gourmets. Hard to find better ramen at twice the price. Try it.\\n\\nMy seven year old grandson likes it too!\"], u'14.Za-Ya Ramen': [u\"Ate here last night--don't even know where to begin. The most delicious ramen I've ever had.\\n\\nWas there with two others. We ordered three apps--the mushrooms, the burdock plate, and the tuna--all excellent. Was a particular fan of the mushrooms: smoky, tangy, very slightly sweet. Can't wait to go back and order every other item on the small plates side of the menu.\\n\\nTwo of us, I'm afraid, had the ramen with tongue, so I couldn't taste three different kinds, but I also got to taste the veggie ramen. (We all three asked for egg noodle rather than the rice noodle.) Both ramen dishes were outstanding, the broth rich, complex and salty; additional egg was dessert-level good, creamy and savory; the tongue was moist and tender, modestly portioned so as not to overwhelm the dish; in-bowl condiments really popped--amazing flavor profile all round. Noodles cooked to perfection. And the size was just right; I'm often unable to finish my bowl at other ramen places.\\n\\nService was a little idiosyncratic. Waiter was lovely, polite, attentive, but not super efficient. Almost had the feeling we were eating at someone's house and had arrived a little early, as though they weren't quite expecting us.\\n\\nCan't wait to go back and try the beef ramen and the fried chicken.\", u\"As a ramen junkie - this was a complete disappointment.  The best thing about this ramen joint was their karrage - which I have to admit is the reason why they got 2 stars instead of one.\\n\\nPros:\\n- service was quick\\n- street parking isn't too hard to come by\\n- one of the best karrages I've had \\n\\nCons:\\n- beef based ramens were both insignificant and not memorable. both soups lacked character and did not impress, not rich enough. Noodles were bland and tasteless. The price point for a bowl of ramen here is extremely expensive for what it is - you don't even get an egg for a 16$ bowl of ramen. \\n- NO AC!! Maybe it's fine to come visit during the winter days - but never again in the warmer weather.\", u\"3.5 stars.\\n\\nIt's nice to have a ramen place nearby,  even if it is on a really strange,  barely trafficked corner. The staff is very nice and polite. I had the miso ramen, and it was quite tasty. Compared to other places though,  it ranks solidly in the middle.  Good but not great. \\n\\nA couple things - there's no AC in the place. This makes the restaurant very uncomfortable when you're serving hot soup in the summer. Also, the counter and high top tables are unnaturally high. For a short person like myself, my legs will either dangle awkwardly (and painfully), or I  have to hunch over a bit so my feet reaches the footrest and then the counter is too high. Who designed this place? Definitely go for the tables in the back.\", u'Just a-ok. The broth had the distinct taste of beef broth. I was similar to the taste of Kalbi Tang of Korean cuisine.\\n\\nThe beef chasu and the menma was good. Very well marinated. The noodles were a okay. \\n\\nLocation was not convenient since it was pretty far off from the city, and it was super hot, no air conditioner when I visited. I sweat a bunch eating the ramen.', u'Went there the other night and the ramen was amazing!!!!\\nVery happy there is a ramen place in the neighborhood', u'I passed by Za-Ya Ramen while I was on a bus. Something told me I should go there. I walked back and I was glad. Other than the usual pork bone base, it was a cow bone base with hand-pulled ramen. And the touch of black peppers made the beautiful bowl of ramen a unforgettable experience. #zaya #ramen #brooklyn #ramenclubnyc #foodporn #cowbone #happiness', u\"A great ramen place at a strange corner. It's on court street that hits Hamilton Ave so it's probably not getting as much foot traffic as other ramen shops in the neighborhood. \\n\\nThe place is small with only a few tables, regardless, the ramen was on point. Za-Ya has a small and simple menu but that's what I came here for...ramen!\\n\\nWe ordered the Chicken Karaage - boneless fried chicken with spicy mayo as appetizer to share. The chicken was lightly breaded and there's ginger in it so it has a hint of heat. It was juicy and delicious without being heavily breaded and fried. \\n\\nWe also ordered the Gyukotsu ramen - creamy beef broth, beef chashu (short ribs), garlic chips and cilantro. The broth was very rich and has a much cleaner taste than some other ramen places I've been to. It's not overly salty either which is good if you don't like salt. The beef chashu reminded me of korean bbq short ribs which was amazingly delicious. Not tough or chewy, but savory with a nice bite to it.\\n\\nThis place is indeed a hidden gem in the neighborhood and I will definitely be back for more.\", u\"Late lunch closing at 3pm and made it just in time before they closed.  Cozy and cute ambiance.   Greeted by our waitress and got seated and left us menus.  \\n\\nAll we felt was the heat.  84 degrees inside consuming these ramen. Only an indoor air conditioner going. There's no windows for AC units Just a heads up.  Could get uncomfortable.  \\n\\nHere's what we ordered:\\nBeef ramen- beef and broth were very flavorful yet not salty. All balanced just the way we like it. Texture of noodle were prepared well.\\nShoyu ramen with chicken-  chicken was tender and broth were  flavorful.  \\nArugula avocado salad-  refreshing with a peanut buttery dressing.  Just enough dressing.  All balance well. \\n\\nOverall we enjoyed our lunch.  Food were executed with excellence. We love that everthing was not complicated of a personal opinion.  Almost lackless on the food level besides for the 84 degree temperature inside. Our waitress was very helpful as well. We will definitely go back as this is of the decent ramen ya in Brooklyn and its beef broth!\", u\"I was really excited to try this spot because there's a lack of Japanese ramen restaurants around the Carroll Gardens area. However, I was very disappointed with my experience here. I've had ramen in Japan before and what I had here tasted nothing like Japanese ramen. The ramen spots in East Village are a much better option. What I had here tasted more like Chinese noodle soup. $16 is a hefty price to pay for subpar ramen! \\n\\nGyukotsu Ramen- I was disappointed with the ramen. The soup broth just didn't taste right. \\nChicken Karage- The chicken was pretty good.\\n\\nAlso, it was insanely hot here! The restaurant does not have AC. There was a fly swarming around because they left the door opened and turned on the fan. I was sweating bullets during my entire meal. It felt torturous to eat $16 hot ramen without AC in 90 degree weather.\", u'Great food, clean and mellow, welcoming vibe. We came here with two adults and four children (ages 2-10) and had a great time. The maitake appetizer was outstanding. I was also happy to see veggie ramen on the menu. So so so good!', u\"Checked this place out not too long after it opened. First thing I noticed were the prices, which were a little higher compared to other ramen spots I've been to in the area. We sat at the counter and the owner made our ramen bowl fresh, right in front of us. He seemed passionate about his restaurant and the ramen was pretty good. Didn't have a bad experience but for the overall price I don't think I'd return.\", u\"I've never had beef bone broth ramen before and was really excited to try this today!\\n\\nFor starter we ordered Chicken Karaage (boneless fried chicken), it was really juicy, tender, and the spicy mayo made it even better. For our main we had Gyukotsu, creamy beef bone ramen with beef charsue, and Shoyu, chicken broth with pork belly. The broth of the beef bone ramen was amazing, and the beef charshu was especially perfect. I could tell that they marinated the charsue probably over night (or hours) to get that flavor. The Shoyu ramen did not bring a lot of flavors to my mouth. The flavors were light, and I thought it personally lacked a hint of salt. After a few spoons of broth, I could also taste the oiliness in the broth. The noodles on the other hand were made perfectly- bouncy and not slimy! \\n\\nOverall it was a great experience and I would come back. If it's your first time there I would highly recommend you to order the Gyukotsu ramen!\", u'Delicious beef broth ramen. Got their gyukatsu which is creamy and rich. Has two big, tender pieces of short rib, saffron, garlic, cilantro, bamboo, radish? and scallions. Ramen were thin and cooked just right. Also got their other beef broth ramen which was clear instead of creamy. It was also very delicious! Cow tongue was tender! Wanted to add an egg but they sold out... Each bowl was $16. Chicken karaage was so good-crunchy, juicy and flavorful. Loved the dipping sauce too. Come visit!', u\"My friends and I were around the area after playing mini golf and we found this place on yelp. I was very intrigued as most ramen places usually have chicken/pork based broths, whereas Za-Ya had a beef broth. \\n\\nUpon entering the shop, I noticed that it was a little warmer than the outside as they did not have AC. Thankfully it wasn't a hot day, I would not have enjoyed eating pipping hot ramen in a hot room. The decor of the place was very minimal with a touch of asian influence, nothing too fancy. \\n\\nI ordered the Gyutan ramen with beef tongue. I really liked how the broth has a salt tare, allowing the true beef flavors to come through. The noodles were cooked al dente, with just the right about of bite, exactly how I like it. The beef tongue was thick cut and extremely tender, i only wish that there could be more than one piece! Definitely add the ajitama (so boiled egg), it was flavored well and cooked to perfection.\\n\\nMy friends ordered the Gyutotsu with seared beef. This also had the beef broth base but it had a soy sauce tare, giving it a completely different flavour. The beef flavor was not as prominent, but it was good too in a different way. The seared beef was surprisingly very tender.\\n\\nOverall, the food was good! One star off for not having AC.\", u\"This was our first experience trying ramen and we loved it! I got the Miso (chicken broth, miso tare, pork belly, shiitake mushrooms, sweet corn) and my husband got the Gyukotsu (beef with garlic and cilantro in a soy sauce tare). Both bowls were super flavorful and filling. I'm a satisfied girl, with my first experience with ramen!\", u\"Most ramen place are either pork bone broth or chicken broth; but the signature broth for this place is beef broth. It's amazing.\\nIt was such a delightful encounter; although it's kind of out of place...but parking is not too hard to find and you can take the F train there. \\nI ordered the beef tongue ramen and although they keep some of the fat on the tongue, it was not overpowering nor do I feel too fattening. The broth was smooth and flavorful - different from pork bone / miso or chicken. I am glad I went, I will definitely be going back for more.\", u'Lovely little ramen spot that bucks the trend of in-your-face, food-coma-inducing, over-salted, thick-brothed, bowls with subtle, balanced flavors, great proteins, perfectly chewy noodles, and hot, delicious broth.\\n\\nAlso, the staff is small and friendly and the space is super-cute. Definitely worth a trip, and hope they stick around for a long while.', u\"I tried their gyokotsu ramen which seems to be their specialty. Ramen in beef bone broth. Idk the taste was overwhelmed by the black pepper they sprinkled over the broth.  I couldn't really taste the flavor of the beef broth. I liked their thin noodle which is my favorite kind, but overall I guess I expected more. Also the price is pretty high at $16. Even ippudo ramen is $15 and they're flavorful! Today they didn't have the fried chicken either, so who knows if that would've bumped up their star rating if I tasted it.  To be fair, I haven't tried their chicken broth noodle soup which is what most ramen place have, so not sure if that would've been tastier. The price for the chicken broth was about $12-13 which isn't too bad. Perhaps, I'll stop by again one day to try their chicken broth ramen and their fried chicken. Maybe the rating will change after that.\", u\"I had a very good experience here last night. Was seated immediately and greeted very kindly. I ordered the first thing off the menu which is a beef broth option, with beef slices. I added saut\\xe9ed mushrooms and corn which were awesome add ins. Everything was fresh and delicious. The only reason why they get 4/5 stars is because 1. The broth needed a bit more kick or something to liven it up. I added some limes and additional seasoning 2. Just for me, one ramen, no drinks, was 20 dollars. Which I think is pretty damn pricy. Either way, food was good! Couldn't even finish the noodles!\", u\"I ate at Za-Ya Ramen on a recent Friday night. The restaurant only had a handful of other patrons, but it's likely due to the fact that they've only been open for a week. I ordered the Gyukotsu Ramen ($16), a beef bone broth ramen, which is what the Mongolian owners said they are known for. \\n\\nThe beef broth was rich, creamy, and full of flavor. It was nice to try something different than the typical pork based broths. It came with two pieces of tender, grilled beef, alongside some carefully arranged toppings. The noodles were more firm than I would've preferred, but were perfect after soaking in the pipping hot broth. This didn't stop me from ordering extra noodles ($2), as I felt the standard serving was not quite enough.\\n\\nOverall, I would recommend this restaurant if you're craving authentic Japanese ramen, without having to venture into Manhattan or endure long wait times. I'm glad to see a ramen shop in this area of Brooklyn, with a friendly staff and reasonable prices.\"], u'150.Grandma\\u2019s House': [u'Have you been away from home for a while? Are you missing the comfort of a \"home\"? If so, this is the perfect spot!\\n\\nMy roommates and I just recently moved to Brooklyn, and it has been a while since any of us have been back home. We were all craving some good diner food when we bumped into this place. As soon as we walked in, it was almost difficult not to appreciate all the work and details around the place; it almost feels like walking into your own grandma\\'s house. If you play close attention to the details, you will notice all the unique characteristics of the walls, the tables, the bar, the ceiling, etc. \\n\\nWe were given a very warm welcome by the server and she took the time to explain the various choices on the menu. I do point out that no one else was in the restaurant, so the server definitely had more time to spend with us. But it was definitely a nice feeling.\\n\\nIn terms of the food, we were given complimentary fried onion rings made with potato chip batter? I don\\'t know what it was made with, but they were heavenly. We ordered bacon mac and cheese, chicken pot pie, and eggs with toast and potatoes. The server was also very kind and gave us a side of complementary grits, simply because I had no idea what they were. The coffee was delicious and was immediately refilled! \\n\\nRegarding the overall cleanliness, some of the plastic covering on the booth cushions were torn where I was sitting. I can\\'t comment on the bathrooms because I did not end up using them. \\n\\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend this place to others! It\\'s a nice, cozy place to go and relax after a long week. I will definitely be returning on a slightly more busy day to see if there is a difference in experience. If you do decide to give this place a visit, make sure to ask them about the history of the place and the owner!', u\"Square bagels are not okay. This place offends me as a native Brooklynite -- it's basically a Brooklyn-themed TGIFridays. It feels so inauthentic and poorly executed that I am compelled to say something.\\nThe decor features a random smattering of Brooklyn kitsch mixed with a strange wall of flags from northeastern tourist attractions. The tuna salad sandwich was a watery mess. Worst of all: the SQUAGLES. How can you claim to be local and authentic and have square bagels on the menu?! \\nAs much as everyone on Yelp is complaining about the service, they were actually really nice and helpful so no complaints there. But the rest of it was just so frustrating!\\nSeems like the whole point of this place is that they are supposed to do comfort food and make you feel comfortable. However, depending on your level of familiarity with Brooklyn, you may feel just the opposite. Maybe if the restaurant was in Cleveland I'd give it a few stars just for trying, but right in the middle of Brooklyn, it seems utterly phoney and out of touch. Their menu uses comic sans, for godsakes!\", u\"So as usual, I'm on a quest to find the best macaroni and cheese spots in NY. I found Grandma's House listed on a blog (I forgot which one it was but best believe when I remember which one suggested this place they will definitely hear my mouth). \\n\\nPros:\\nCozy decor\\nThey had food (can that be a pro?????)\\n\\nCons:\\n1) We received a mediocre greeting upon entry. It almost seemed like they hated the fact that customers were coming. Or maybe they were surprised someone would want to eat at this establishment.\\n\\n2) They only had one server for the entire restaurant. Yes the place is small but this server doubled as the bartender, to go cashier, food prep and waiter. I mean it was ridiculous.\\n\\n3) The wait was extremely long (I guess it was because they were a one man show).\\n\\n4) The macaroni and cheese was bland and the texture was disturbing!!! It tasted like mushy wet noodles with unsalted, bland cheese on top. My son liked it but then again he likes anything. After waiting for over an hour he was bound to eat anything. \\n\\n5) This place was super expensive for mediocre food. I don't understand how people can be okay with paying 4 star restaurant prices for a place that basically served diner food. \\n\\nOverall:\\nI don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.\", u\"WHO'S HOUSE?!! GRANDMA'S HOUSE!!\\n\\nI came to Grandma's House based on Yelp Reviews of best Mac and Cheese. I ordered for take out. My order consisted of bacon mac and cheese and their famous chicken pot pie. The bacon mac and cheese wasn't bad, definitely better than most places I've tried. However, it's not the best I've ever had, but will still eat it again. Now, the chicken pot pie comes in two sizes, personal or a larger amount. The personal size is small and priced at $14, which is pretty steep. My husband says it was good, but wasn't amazing for the price. We would however eat from here again.\\n\\nSo I took off 1 star, because the waitress was on her phone the whole time even when I walked in. She also charged my card for someone else's bill instead of my take out order, however, she fixed it. Lastly, the place seemed dirty, knives on the floor. The place needed some tender, loving, care and a much needed sweep.\", u\"Disappointed by our lunch at Grandma's House, although the atmosphere was cute and I really WANTED to like it. The restaurant was practically empty when we arrived and yet none of the servers came over to seat us. One made eye contact with us several times and continued to ignore us. When he finally came over, he seated us without a smile. The service throughout the meal remained poor.\\n\\nThe food was mediocre. Eggs were under seasoned. The Cobb salad was totally average. The side of pickles were mushy and lacked that pickle crunch I love. It all just missed the mark in my opinion.\", u\"Absolutely love this place. Passed by the other day, it caught my eye. I told my bf we had to visit. So glad I did. We were greeted warmly and seated quickly. He place has a rustic old time look- I loved all of the antique signs hung around the restaurant. Our waitress greeted us warmly, took our orders and checked on us frequently. I had an omelette, with home fries, and sausage, my boyfriend had the red white and blue pancakes with fresh fruit. Everything was delicious. \\n\\nThe best part was meeting one of the owners, he was very nice. Had a great conversation with him- I'll have to go back and try the famous chicken pot pie. I will be back soon. Had a great experience and definitely recommend this place.\", u\"Adorable spot to bring your significant other! The food was delicious and the service was great. The atmosphere is so cute and cozy.  I'm so glad I found Grandma's! We were searching for a place to get a late breakfast and we first tried a restaurant a few minutes away, but we could not get in as the line was literally out the door. So I did a quick search on Yelp and found Grandma's nearby. We decided to go check it out before we gave up and went to a bagel shop. Grandma's was an instant hit! First of all, no crazy lines and no waiting. It was nice and quiet and we were seated right away.  The store is decorated with all kinds of fun memorabilia from a time ago. It's just a fun atmosphere to eat in. We got eggs, potatoes, French toast (they call it American toast) and coffee. Everything was delicious! We will be back soon!\", u\"Had been there a few times before and although the place was empty, the wait was long but the food was okay. This afternoon,  place was empty, the wait was long AND the food was disgusting.  My husband's food came incomplete, we literally had to go into the kitchen and get his ham. Then he ordered white toast, he got wheat and one slice was toasted and one slice just bread (not toasted). My order also came in piece meal (too disgusted to eat), my daughter ordered a grilled cheese and the cheese was not melted. A friend ordered a cheeseburger that came on toast but had burnt fried meat stuck to it. We have no idea what kind of meat it was. Dishes had old food stuck to them and our fork had hair entangled in it. All this after waiting over an hour for food and a 135.00 bill. Yuk!\", u'Had a Burger and fries which were decent. The service was pretty bad, no greeting from the waitress or even eye contact when we arrived, similar when serving us (she did not seem happy to be working there, maybe was having a bad day). The place also looked pretty run, not a great experience. Overpriced place.', u\"From the moment you get to the door you get a homie feeling. The decor brings childhood memories to life! If that wasn't enough the home cooked meals from breakfast to dinner all day long. The food is as custom as every inch of the restaurant. You must come and visit!\", u\"So I came across this place on yelp . I figure it looks so cute let me try . I came in and all this nostalgia items were everywhere I was super excited !!! It took someone 10 min to seat me in a empty place because there are so many cooks in the back and only one front end person ... the menu is fairly big so it took time and I had questions , I asked the waitress questions because well the menu wasn't descriptive so I asked what a pretzel burger was ??? Because no description she said one second let me ask .. apparently she was new every question I had took her 3 min to ask and then Come back with an answer . Now let me get this straight ... you employee Simone new and don't give her any insight on the menu ? Or any extra body to help her ? Confusing ... the burger was good but nothing to brag about the service sucks that's it\", u\"Drove by all the time and the name drew my attention but the Grandma didn't have much in common with my Grandma! Lol! Food was average and so was the service.\", u'stay away!!!! three tables got up and left. hair in my salad that took hours. when no one was in the place. spoiled food served. disgusting believe me i will make sure everyone i know not to go!!!!!!', u'+++\\n- loved the real onion rings\\n- they give a lot of them\\n\\n++\\n- that chicken pot pie crust....mannnnnnnnn listen\\n\\n+\\n- ribs are succulent, and fall off the bone\\n\\n- \\n- not the biggest fan of bbq sauce\\n- not the biggest fan of the egg creams', u\"I simply loved this place. I went there on August 19, 2017. I had breakfast for dinner: cheese grits, bacon and waffles. The grits were creamy and fresh. Of course cheddar cheese. The Maplewood bacon were thick slices and delicious. A waffle with REAL maple syrup. Yum. We had chocolate (blackout?) Cake that was so light and The filling was creamy. Delish. We had a carafe of mimosas that was not watered (juiced) down. \\n\\nThe waitress did double and triple as everything, but she was attentive and so polite. The owner Kevin sat and chatted with us. \\n\\nI will definitely go here again, and again and again. Don't sleep on this one. Good old fashioned eats. If you are a REAL foodie, add this to your list.\", u\"Literally grandmas house... It took 40 minutes for the only person working there to give us menus. It then took 20 minutes for her to come take our order. When she finished taking our order she literally ran away from our table like she was participating in some marathon. Unfortunately the cook wasn't in the same marathon it took exactly 56 minutes for hour food to come. Finally FOOD!!! If only there wasn't a fly in the Cobb Salad we ordered. In disappointment and rage we got up and started to leave before we were given a bill stating we had to pay for everything we didn't eat. Absolutely the worst place I have ever eaten at!!!\", u\"Grandma's House is an All American kitschy comfort food paradise for those who need a little TLC. They rarely seat any one in the front of house, so do not get discouraged if you think they're closed, just yank on the door and find out! Service is neighborly, kind, and chipper. \\n\\nFor the location, affordability, and ability to seat a group, Grandma's House gets four stars. With a great location on Atlantic, its easy to get to and easy to find. Most of the menu is under $15 and the portions are good. There are plenty of nooks to seat groups of 15-20 and also smaller nooks for paties of 8. They're also very family friendly. I think there is a step up to get into the restaurant, but I also saw a number of strollers in here, so it's not impossible. \\n\\nThe food is three stars, more because its rather generic, diner like food. We ordered:\\nShort stack pancakes with fruit - tasty, fluffy, great with syrup\\nCoffee - standard drip in a small mug\\nChicken crisps - fried chicken thighs, pounded flat, rolled in potato chips and served with a buttermilk quasi ranch dip, these are addictive and a great side\\nTaylor ham and cheese sandwich - tasty fluffy bread, crisp ham and gooey cheese. I wish there was more ham to bread ratio, but for the $8 price, it will pass. \\nFor next time: looks like the chicken pot pie is the winner here. Will have to try when I come back not at brunch.\", u'The cutest vintage diner! Mason Jars, Plastic-Wrapped Booths & the Mini Skillets add to the aesthetic. Plus the breakfast food and the Kona Coffee was amazingg. Thanks Grandma!', u\"I don't think I've ever felt so welcomed at a restaurant. Grandma's House might be the only reason why I'd ever choose to go to Boerum Hill. \\n\\nI came here on a Sunday and was immediately impressed with the ambiance. It definitely gives off that stereotypical-grandma's-house feel. From the table cloths to the menu itself, they definitely succeeded in living up to its name and exceeding my expectations. For the size of the restaurant, the menu is pretty extensive. \\n\\nIt wasn't busy when a friend and I came here but our server was really sweet. She was attentive but not overbearing. She was apologetic about the fact that we had to wait a little longer than usual because what we ordered had to be prepared from scratch. I dunno about you, but that's something I actually like to hear, especially if it is chicken pot pie and mac and cheese that I'm waiting for. They were so apologetic that they even provided us with complimentary onion rings which they really didn't have to do, but I appreciated the effort in making my friend and I comfortable while we waited. Needless to say the food was well worth the wait and I'll definitely be back.\", u'I even don\\'t want to give one star okay? This place suck! I can\\'t believe such a rude service in NYC! I ordered twice from this restaurant via door dash and both times they don\\'t have what I ordered. the first time a man helped me cancel the order with door dash and he is nice. But the second time a woman was extremely rude and she said : \"listen this is your money not mine. So you are going to contact doordash and cancel this order, not me.\" This logic is so freaking stupid because first of all, it is not me can\\'t serve as professional. You are the one who disappoint a customer twice okay? \\nI don\\'t care if the food here is good because that shit-head destroys everything that a restaurant should do.\\nAnyway this restaurant deserves only one star because of that stupid woman without any responsible and unbelievably rude!!!'], u'138.Jalapa Jar': [u\"Second outpost for Jalapa Jar, whose first location is inside the Clark Street Subway station. This new location is larger, and actually has tables and seats for you to dine-in as opposed to just grabbing to go. For fellow Tex-plants out there, you'll definitely feel right at home - ice cold Topo Chico in stock and breakfast tacos with names that pay homage to their Texan origins. \\n\\nAll of the tacos are good here, and at $7 for two, an extremely reasonable price for the amount of food you're getting. Their salsa is arguably some of the best you can get in the city, and you can buy jars of them to go. The people who work here are all extremely nice and friendly. They take CC via Square which is convenient.\\n\\nIt's dangerous that this place is so close to me - feel like I'm going to be here quite a bit!\", u\"Good food and nice atmosphere. Prices are very reasonable.\\n\\nI got the Chicken + Rice bowl and enjoyed it. Also got the chips and queso. The chips and queso is a really large serving so it feeds 3-4 easily. The bowl is a nice size but the sauces aren't that strong. I would definitely go for a medium or spicy salsa.\", u\"So happy to find a way to get my tacos 'n' Topo Chico fix on the otherwise-uninspiring walk down Flatbush. (I was super grateful for the Clark St location, but I'm even more grateful to have a nice place to sit while I chow down.) Breakfast tacos are choice - lots of variety, reasonably priced, big and filling. What more could you ask for?\"], u'28.Ugly Baby': [u\"Oh man, oh man is this place good (and SPICY). \\n\\nCame on a Thursday night at around 7pm and got a table without a wait (though I will say that at around 8pm, there was weirdly a wait). The restaurant is very inviting, but not huge...that being said, they made no effort to rush us out as we stayed for almost 2 hours and I REALLY appreciated that. \\n\\nNow, the food: for 2 people, we ordered three dishes and we even had food to take home. We ordered the Laab Ped Udon (spicy duck salad - OMG, so spicy seriously but I couldn't stop picking on it), Khoong Muk Kai Kem (a seafood dish that was spicy in a different way but yummy as well), and the famous Khao Soi (which was definitely my favorite and a great balance to the spicier duck salad). \\n\\nWould love to come back and try more dishes. BTW, they take credit cards now...though they are still BYOB.\", u\"We came here on a Wednesday night around 8pm and got seated after 5-10min. We ordered the Khao Soi, Duck Salad and Shrimp & Squid with Salted Egg Yolk. They were all excellent but the Khao Soi was a real standout. 3 dishes was perfect for 2 people. \\n\\nThey don't mess around with the peppers, and I was tearing about 15 minutes in! The Khao Soi packed a punch but it was the duck salad that was a suicide mission with little pepper seeds that had a delayed effect.\\n\\nOverall excellent meal and service! We will be back for more spicy adventures!\", u'Ugly indeed. While the place was jam packed and they were busy, I can\\'t excuse shitty service /poor hygiene/and bland/underwhelming food.\\n\\nTue Ka Ko fried little coconut milk cakes with black bean & taro - I thought this would be flavorful but no. The cake itself was bland. The sauce that accompanied it helped but even after drowning the cake in it - it didn\\'t help it enough. \\n\\nKanom Jean Nam - rice vermicelli, green curry chicken, chilies - no complexity in the curry - it was a pile of vermicelli noodles with pieces of chicken. It was spicy to the point where no other flavor could be detected. I don\\'t mind food being spicy but as long as all the other flavors still pull through. Gratuitous spice is just as bad as someone yelling \"fuck\" over and over again to get their point across. It\\'s futile. \\n\\nService: chaotic. unorganized. not aware of their own space. sneezing into their hands and not washing after. not taking my order until flagging someone down. requested extra sauce: took about 5 minutes to receive while they attended to other things. Just a lack of common sense in their steps of service. \\n\\nThey deliver as well. By the amount of to go boxes piling up, I imagine many of their problems are due to expanding to delivery without having enough bandwidth to take it all on. \\nAlso: efficiency would be stepped up if they would invest in a POS device instead of handwriting orders. Waste of time.', u\"Do not come here expecting to find Pad Thai or Pad See Ew on the menu. Menu is simple and you won't hate anything, at least we didn't. The restaurant isn't huge, so do expect to wait on the weekends. \\n\\nWe came on a Saturday evening around 8pm and were expecting to wait. We were told it would be an hour wait and so we left our number and went to a bar nearby. We came back to check in an hour and we ended up waiting for an additional hour. Clearly that didn't affect my 5 star rating. By the end of dinner, we all agreed that it was worth the wait, including the new friends we made while sharing our table.\\n\\nThe menu is very straight forward and everything can or should be eaten family-style. For 4 people, we ordered dishes and here's my take on them:\\n\\n- Laab Ped Udon - Do not mistaken the name for udon noodles, nothing like that. It's a spicy duck salad that is VERY addicting. Scoop it with the cabbage that comes as a side. It'll help cool down the spice.\\n- Kang Hoh - delicious with unique flavors that you won't find at any other Thai restaurant. Also, it's topped with chicharones!\\n- Gao Lao - i think this is best for a cold winter day. It's very heart-warming. It's an herbal soup with brisket, alot of brisket! Best eaten with a bowl or rice.\\n- Kanom Jean- refreshing curry chicken, very mild in spice compared to everything else. More of a sweet curry but the noodles pair with it oh so very well\\n\\nAlso, this place is BYOB!!! Run over to the deli down the block and grab some beer to cool off the spice. Overheard that they are expanding their menu so what more they can add. Perhaps dessert?! I will definitely be back and hope to beat the line.\", u'This is not your average Thai spot. There\\'s no pad thai. There are no drunken noodles. This isn\\'t that place...which is good, because there are so many of those places in NYC, and nothing like Ugly Baby. \\n\\nThe staff knows this. Upon our arrival, our waitress was adorably concerned about our knowledge of Thai cuisine, and about the level of spice we were looking for. We mentioned we were fans of Kao\\xa0Soy over in Red Hook, and she lit up, but warned us that this was a bit different. Instead of focusing only on Northern Thai cuisine, here they pull specialties from many regions of the country which makes for an enticing array of dishes I can\\'t wait to try. \\n\\nI told our waitress that we didn\\'t need crazy spicy food which she seemed a bit disappointed by, but made a few suggestions for our weak American palates. I basically was just trying to avoid anything like the Kua Kling, the beef curry which is literally described on the menu as \"brutally spicy.\" I don\\'t need anything about my food to be brutal, and didn\\'t want to accidentally get something that would burn on the way in AND the way out. \\n\\nWe started with the Tue Ka Ko, fried coconut milk cakes studded with black beans and served with a sweet dipping sauce. They are like tiny little savory corn muffins, and an excellent way to start the meal. Next time I want to check out the Gai Golae (chicken skewers). \\n\\nWe\\'ve missed the Kao Soy at Kao Soy (and its later iteration at Chiang Mai), so we couldn\\'t resist the former namesake dish. The Kao Soy has been rechristened Khao Soi Nuer here, and it comes with beautifully tender chunks of braised beef shank that falls apart when you poke at it. Also hidden in the curry soup are beef meatballs; they are a bit rubbery and texturally not my bag, but still quite tasty. The mass of fried noodles from Kao Soy has given way to tender egg noodles, and only a few crispy bits on top. The flavor of the curry is still fantastic, and has a heat that builds as the meal goes on.\\n\\nThe Mee Kati Isan is a generous portion of rice noodles smothered in a ground pork peanut curry, with raw veggies served alongside. The staff recommends that you mix it all together, and squeeze the lime on top. (This was also exactly the same advice we received for the Khao Soi, and I think it\\'s pretty much a good rule for all Thai food.) Even though we pulled the red chiles off the top of the dish, it also had a fairly serious spice too it. Nothing you can\\'t handle, but just be aware. \\n\\nWe\\'ve only been the once so far, so I only have these three dishes to go on (plenty of food for two people), but each was interesting and delicious and I\\'m happy we ordered them. That said, I\\'m absolutely going to try different items next time we visit because I wasn\\'t truly blown away by anything and it all sounds pretty fascinating.\\n\\nThe space is bright and colorful, with one line of tables leading to the open kitchen in the back. There aren\\'t really any frills, but the service is excellent (plenty of water refills which my weak American ass really appreciated), and who needs frills?\\n\\nCash only and BYOB, but they say that\\'s just for now.', u\"Ok....You went to Thailand, you LOVED the food, you came back to New York, went to a Thai restaurant, and it tasted NOTHING like Thailand!\\n\\n\\nGo to Ugly Baby!! ...NOW!!.\\n   Its Funky, Spicy, Real Thai Food, and not Pretentious.\\n\\nif you can't handle Real Thai food, go somewhere else.\", u'Such beautiful flavors, delicate preparations, lovely presentations, bold textures, excellent cooking, attractive interior-design, and sincerely friendly happy waitstaff. Everything is so fresh, distinct, clean, structured, balanced, and vibrant. Not only is it all approachable and affordable, it\\'s also very enjoyable, because there is none of the affectation or aloofness of \"critically acclaimed\" Thai re-creations nearby (where the portions are small, prices are huge, and the useless waiters just cannot be bothered to give a damn).\\n\\nWe tried six dishes (plus steamed rice & sticky rice), but it\\'s basically impossible to choose a favorite. Tonight, the Red Snapper in Ginger and Tamarind was incredibly tender and understated, while the Kua Kling (Beef Shank Dry Curry) was absolutely addictive (such assertive turmeric, green peppercorns, red chilies, kaffir lime) that even though it was indeed brutally spicy (as it says on the menu) neither of us could stop eating it, and the Mushroom & Pineapple Curry was crazy delicious (so many types of succulent unctuous fungi contrasted brilliantly by little bursts of tart and tangy fruits). Yesterday\\'s meal was still exciting, but overwhelming, which was our own fault, drinking too many high-octane beers and ordering too many dishes, so the juicy jiggly peppery Duck Feet were a little too much following our tremendous platter of Hanger Steak with Green Curry Rice Vermicelli and our phenomenal platter of Short RIbs and Pork Shoulder with Red Curry Mung Bean Noodles. \\n\\nIn every way, this is the kind of place I\\'d very much like to return to frequently, as soon and as often as possible, because it\\'s genuinely great people serving authentically amazing food, and nothing has been short of fantastic. Who could ask for anything more? Not me, this is just about as good as it gets in my book.', u\"It's good to not fear the heat. Accepting spicy food transcends your body another level - just have tissues and cold water nearby. You'll be fine. I call this stuff happy food. If you're afraid of flavor, don't come here. You're lame. This place is totally awesome. Running back for more.\", u\"Spice and taste galore with flavors that exceed beyond your average Thai palette, Ugly Baby is hands down the absolute best Thai food I've had in the US. BYOB without the corking fee, the service is warm and friendly and the darting smiles in the kitchen as they prepare your delicious meal is infectious. Go there tonight and go back often.\", u'Tucked away in a quiet block is this sleepy gem! If you can\\'t take the heat, get out of the kitchen! This is one of reward LEGIT THAI restos in NYC! Many Thai places over the years have \"American-ized\" to suit the American palate. But I believe true Thai food should not have to compromise it\\'s identity. This place focuses on food from different regions and uses curry plays and powder, peppercorns, chili\\'s to reflect that properly. Here you won\\'t get glorified spicy sweet pad thai, pad see ewwwww that the average American is used to. Here you get it the way true Thais eat and I loved it for THAT! The wait was 45 minutes on Friday evening at 7:45. So we took a stroll up and down Smith while waiting. We got back at 8:25 and our hostess said or table was paying and would be ready in a row. Perfecto! The tiny restaurant only seats maybe 25 people between its tables and bar seating. While we were waiting folks that walked out seemed happy and had burning mouths! Good sign!!! We were seated and ordered pretty quickly. At first we were worried that food would take forever because two large party tables just sat before us but we were pleasantly surprised. Another plus at the moment is its BYOB. We brought a bottle of bubbles and that complimented the food very well. The Laab Ped Udon (Spicy Duck Salad) was simple with its chunks of duck that were generously dry marinaded with HEAT! There wasn\\'t a whole lot of sauce which led you to believe it wasn\\'t too hot. The cucumbers, cabbage and string beans that it came with were great to scoop up the duck. After two bites the heat started building. The mushroom pineapple curry came just in time.for me to need to quench the fire in my mouth. When I thought the coconut milk in the mushroom pineapple curry would help calm the fire in my mouth it actually added to the fire!!! But the taste..the taste was Oh so amazing between the tofu which soaked up the sweetness of the pineapple and the actual curry sauce being just sweet enough for it to be fragrant but not too sweet!  But as the heat intensified I found table loving it more and more. The Tom Som Plaza Kra Kong (snapper) came just in time before I stuck my whole face in the mushroom pineapple curry and slurped up all that sauce! The snapper was simple but reflective of the basic flavors of ginger and tamarind. This actually helped calm the fire down a bit but it had a more subtle heat. The soup that it came with was clean and refreshing! My mouth was burning up but I still wanted more. When the Kang Ho (northern dry Hung Le and red curry paste with pork shoulder, spare ribs and ming bean noodles) came out, that was a nice finisher. That had some heat too but the sticky rice and pork rinds helped! After having all that and then going back to the spicy duck salad, and rotating all over again between the various dishes, the flavor and spices in these dishes made us almost finish everything!! Normally when I have champagne I get buzzed but with last night\\'s spicy dishes, this was the perfect combo!!!! We def want to go back to try the other dishes soon!!! Stay true to your identity!', u\"Really excited to have this new authentic Thai resto in our 'hood...makes for a fun eating adventure!\\n\\nThe hub and I stumbled upon this place last weekend -- it was rather early on Sunday evening, so there were a few tables open and we figured why not?  \\n\\nAs we'd not planned it, we didn't have any beverages with us (this place is BYO), but we did have cash (it was cash-only at that point, though they now take Amex --yippee!). \\n\\nWe tried two dishes on our initial visit -- Khao Soi Nuer and Mee Kati Isan.  The former came first and it was the standout.  The server had said it wasn't a very spicy dish, but that's all relative.  I suggest first trying it without mixing the dollop of spicy red sauce into the broth...it's got a nice heat level that way.  If you want it spicier, then mix it in.  Once we did so, my mouth was burning and my nose was running, but it was pretty addictive.  A solid dish that we deemed repeatable, despite feeling like the noodles were a tad overcooked.  \\nHaving the Mee Kati dish after the Khao Soi put it at a disadvantage as it couldn't match the dynamic flavors, partially because our mouths were already on fire which didn't allow appreciation of subtler flavors.  Again, we found the noodles a bit overcooked.\\n\\nWe liked the place enough that we returned tonight (less than a week later), this time equipped to enjoy the BYO component.  It was 7/7:30pm on a Friday night and we were told the wait would be 45mn.  Thankfully we stuck closeby, as a couple seats happened to open up at the bar after about 20mn.  That is a very reasonable wait on a Friday night in Brooklyn!\\nWe got the Khao Soi again, as well as a new-to-us dish, Khoong Muk Kai Kem.  Our server this time called out that the first dish would be quite spicy, which we'd learned on our first visit.  It was consistently good, still a winner for us.  Unfortunately, once again, we were served the spicier dish first so it was difficult to evaluate the merits of the second dish.  We definitely liked it, though the calamari was a tad rubbery.  \\n\\nBottom line:  the staff is friendly, but they need to be able to describe the dishes better -- simply telling us which part of Thailand it's from is not helpful unless you're already very familiar with the different regional cuisines of Thailand.  They also need to curate the order of the dishes so you're not eating a super spicy, super flavorful dish followed by a dish that's less so, as then that second dish is inevitably not as enticing/appreciated.  \\n\\nWe'll definitely return, likely to repeat the Khao Soi and try something new.  This place has a promising future, for sure!\", u\"The space is hip and pretty, and a bit workaday. The restaurant became rather loud once it filled up. There are about 15 tables. For the time being it is BYO. They are attempting to get a liquor license. The service was responsive and pleasant.\\n\\nWe ordered four dishes. \\n\\nA) The duck salad was very spicy!! And I like spicy.  Be prepared. It's a bit like getting into a bath that is a bit too hot, unpleasant at first, and you start to sweat under your eyebrows and your life changes. \\n\\nB) The pork, vermicelli, bean sprout dish was good. It had lots of coconut milk/cream and wasn't quite as spicy as the duck. It felt refreshing.\\n\\nC)\\nThe snapper was a bit fishy, and I like fish. Also a bit bland.\\n\\nD)\\nThe mackerel was pretty damn fishy and I like fish. The sauce was tangier and more flavorful than the snapper.\\n\\nDefinitely worth a college try. Not for everybody.\", u\"WOW!!!\\n\\nOK, so we were huge fans of the original version of Kao Soy and Chiang Mai in Red Hook.  When Chiang Mai closed, we were really bummed out, but we were told they were going to open another restaurant in the future so that alleviated some of our sorrow!\\n\\nIn subsequent months we tried other Thai restaurants, nothing was nearly as good as the food we had grown so accustomed to and loved so very much.  We *really* missed Chiang Mai... \\n\\nMonth after month we would check Chiang Mai's Facebook page desperately trying to find an update on the status of the new restaurant, but there was little information.  And then.... after a year or was it two years?... FINALLY!!!  Our wait was over!!!\\n\\nUgly Baby!  What a great name!  We went to the website and learned that the dishes are based on cuisine from all different regions in Thailand.  The prior restaurants were focused on Northern Thai food, so this would be something new and exciting!\\n\\nLiterally the next day we went to Ugly Baby, and we were so happy to see all of the familiar faces we missed so much!\\n\\nWe looked at the menu and didn't know where to start.  We went with several suggested dishes, knowing we would be in good hands...  and then..  our first dish was presented...\\n\\nKao Tod Nam Klook - curried rice, pork skin, peanut & ginger.  And with the very first bite, oh... my... god!  The wait was over!  Such flavor... oh my... so yes, we both decided we could eat this dish every single day and never get tired of it!\\n\\nGai Golae - southern style chicken thigh skewers.  Amazing!  Chicken so tender it almost melted off the skewers... wonderfully flavored...  really superb.\\n\\nKhoong Muk Kai Kem - shrimp, squid & salted egg yolk.  Simply delicious.  Need to have this again.\\n\\nKang Hoh - northern dry Hung Le & red curry paste with pork shoulder, spare ribs & mungbeen noodles.  Fantastic!!  Really special.\\n\\nSo that was dinner for two, and we absolutely loved every dish equally.\\n\\nAll of these dishes present a symphony of different flavors that seem to have a beginning, a middle, and an end!  It's not just one note of flavor that stays consistent throughout the plate.  It's a symphony for the tongue!!  It sounds crazy but it's true!\\n\\nWe didn't think it was possible, but Ugly Baby is even better than the former restaurants.  We can't wait to go back and try the rest of the food on the menu.\\n\\nThank you Chef Sirichai!  \\n\\nTL;DR - If you want the best Thai Food in NYC go to Ugly Baby.  Period.\", u'This place is going to send Pok Pok out of business! Excellent menu and not your average NYC Thai spot. When they say the Kua Kling is brutally spicy they mean it- but it in no way sacrifices flavor. It is delightfully seasoned and prepared and served with a string of green peppercorns. \\nDuck salad was also A+ and eXXXtra spicy. Should have been served with more lettuce. \\nThey were out of Khao Soi- which sucked- but means we now have to go back! \\nThe spicy food here had me crying and sweating like a big fat hairy ugly bad baby!', u\"You won't be disappointed visiting Ugly Baby. Pure, authentic, unapologetic Thai cuisine. This restaurant has the potential to become one of the most well regarded Thai establishments in NYC ... which is full of Thai restaurants. This stands out above and beyond the rest. Be sure to try the Kao Soy, pork shoulder and definitely attempt the brutally spicy beef dish!!\", u\"Bring your friends who brag about eating raw ghost peppers. When the waitstaff tell you that a dish is very very spicy and ask if that's ok, say yes and swallow your ego when your nose starts dripping and your tongue numbs. The duck salad did me in but was still super flavorful. I appreciate the fresh herbs and cooling raw veggies to help balance the heat. This place gets busy even on weeknights but waits aren't too long.\", u'We were personally invited by the chef and he did NOT disappoint! This is not your average greasy spoon Thai food. It was so delicious and spicy and full of flavor. And the staff was so friendly! Highly recommend!!', u'The restaurant just opened in carroll.

Worth the wait!!\"], u'206.Tacos Lokos 4ever': [u'As both Texan and Californian, let me say that these are the some of the most delicious So-Cal/Tex-Mex inspired tacos in all of Greenpoint. Situated in the back of a dive bar, this place is a no frills munch-fest of the highest standard. Truly delicious beyond comprehension.\\n\\nThe food is the shining star here because, let me say, there\\'s a few things you\\'ll have to get past before sitting down to eat. The B rating, meh, happens. Also, the bar can get loud and is often filled with the same drunkin\\' neighborhood crew. Aside from that, the chef and his girlfriend who run the place aren\\'t the friendliest of staff -- they give off a sort of Soup Nazi vibe. \\n\\nBut just like the soup nazi, we are all not deserving of these tacos. There are too good for the dark and disturbing world we occupy. So if the women taking your order snarls at you and says, \"you\\'re gonna have to wait 30 mins for your order, OK?\" in her passive aggressive voice, hinting that she doesn\\'t give a fuck about you or your fucking taco order, then you better wait that damn 30 minutes! Because these tacos will be the best taco experience you\\'ve ever had in Greenpoint. Promise.\\n\\nTry the \"magic\" taco w/ a fried egg. You won\\'t regret it. And if you\\'re feeling really adventurous, hit up the fried spam in the \"puppet\" taco. Wash it down with a couple of brews from the bar and bask the in the glory of dope ass tacos.', u'First of all you wont find this place\\nThere is no signboard at all\\nAsked few people outside but nobody knew it\\nAt last after crossing it 4 times with my google map on...entered in a shop to ask where it is and wow it was right in there...such a small window serving tacos in a bar\\nHad not much options...place was boring', u'Who comes up with places like this?! I leave LIC in search of a late night eatery past midnight, and find this place on yelp. So i jump in the car and head to brooklyn, which is luckily just a short bridge ride away. Within 7 minutes, I arrive, looking around like a crazy person for a taco joint that supposedly open at this hour. With no sign around, I decide to go ask the only bar on the block thats still open. Low and behold, Tacos Lokos in the house, baby!\\nIt a small dive eatery with a order window and a grill man in the background. The prices are on the pricey side for a small dive taco joint, but not gonna complain for a place thats willing to feed me at this hour. I ordered a burrito with steak inside, which was freaking delicious! they add potatos inside and makes it very breakfast food like. I thought the flavor of the food was great, so Ill pass on being pissed about paying $17 for it.\\nIt was also very nice of them to respect the yelp check in promotion : free bean taco, which was also really good. The burrito did not fill me up unfortunately, so I was really glad to have that taco to help fill that void space in my tummy. I also liked that they served me where I sat waiting instead of having to run to the window to pick up my order. One major Con was that the food took a long time to make. \\nP.S. To those who dont decide to read my entire review, know that the joint is in the back of the bar. Please Knock 4 times, takes 3 steps back, bow, do one back flip and run straight inside. MAKE NO EYE CONTACTS WITH ANYONE INSIDE!', u\"Tacos Lokos 4ever is a dream come true. A window in the back of a great bar with huge delicious breakfast tacos served until late? Could not imagine anything as dreamy.\\n\\nBreakfast for dinner, bars and tacos are a few of my favorite things, so this was really a match made in heaven. \\n\\nThe menu is simple, but everything sounded delicious. I went with a breakfast taco with eggs, house-made chorizo and more. SOOOO good, and super filling.\\n\\nBonus points for a menu that notes that they can be accommodating of allergies like gluten free or dairy free. Plus Danny himself was there and immediately asked if I had an issue with gluten when I asked to get my taco on a corn tortilla. He was friendly and reassuring.\\n\\nLove knowing that this spot is in my neighborhood, and I can't wait to come back!\", u\"On the pricey side, but these are destination quality tacos in New York's relative Mexican food desert (I'm from Arizona so I'm hard to please).\\n\\nLocated in the back of a bar, TL4 promises that Mexican fix for the boozers, but it's definitely more than just drunk food. I got the bean and cheese taco followed by the steak. I was impressed with both. Delicious, high quality vegetables and meat; zesty without being spicy. Normally I like heat, but didn't think to ask today, still for the weak among ye, the food is interesting without being scorching. The tortilla was great and while I definitely wanted a third taco. \\n\\nAmbiance is a bar, but they do have booze, booths, and table service after you order. Staff was super helpful and guided me to the steak taco as being the all star- which I added an egg too for that extra touch (an original accent I've never had before). \\n\\nFor the locals, this place should be on your regular list, for anyone else, if you want among the best conventional tacos I've had in NYC, they're here.\", u\"This one man show in the back of the Brooklyn Safehouse is amazing. I don't know how he does it. \\n\\nPresented for your consideration, imagine one man capable of feeding hundreds of drunkards per night. He somehow remains kind, friendly and patient with his intoxicated customers. He's taking the orders, preparing the food, cooking over the stove top, and running the food. Essentially he's doing the same job that most restaurants have 4 people for. \\n\\nWe went here at around 1:30 AM (he serves until 2AM) and he told us there was about a 15-20 minute wait. Whelp, it sure was worth the wait! \\n\\nThe food tastes like home cooking in the best way possible. I think the secret ingredient is care. Everything was so delicious. \\n\\nSo when your drunk ass gets there and you're told there's a wait...be nice and polite to this man and give him your business. We like him.\", u'Took 30-35 min for food after being told it will take 10-15 min.\\nWe were on the way for somthing else.

When we asked after 15 minutes how long the food would take, one of the men abruptly said \"CAN I HELP YOU!?\". \\n\\nYes, sure.

Lol if you have that craving after few good drinks, you know what I am talking about. So I want to give you heads up for the review, I was little drink when I had my (wow) tacos here, so consider it :)\\nTacos taste as tacos should taste like: as they were just made at home kitchen. For me, there is is how I judge tacos. And here they got that. Small tiny place, that makes better tacos than most fancy big restaurants. \\nOne thing: they take cash only. Which was little awkward since I had no cash on me. But it is all good. We were able to get around it.', u\"Massive and delicious tacos. It's cash only but you can pay with venmo!!! Winning. You should come just for that. And for the $5 beer Corona\", u\"I live a few doors down from this place and never new it existed until one day I was craving Mexican food and found it on Yelp. It's inside of a bar called Brooklyn Safehouse. The place is generally dark and uninviting so I would never had thought there would be a taco shop in the back. This place is literally a whole in the wall. I am originally from LA so I'd like to think I'm a burrito & taco snob so it's hard to please me. This place specializes in breakfast tacos & burritos sold at night. Breakfast for dinner is everything to me so I was stoke to find it! I got the chorizo burrito. It was pretty good, I particularly liked the tortilla. I'm really picky when it comes to tortillas because often I feel they're too thick out here in the east coast. Their tortilla is perfectly just the way I like it. Overall I'd give the burrito 4 out 5 stars. I thought it could've used just a little bit of salt & spice. When I think of chorizo I think of flavor taking over my mouth. The burrito fell a little short of it. Would I go there again? yes! I wanna try their tacos next time and quesadillas. Those looked good too. I waited a little bit long for the burrito but there are booths you can sit & wait in so I didn't mind. The staff is also very nice & helpful.\", u\"Because breakfast for dinner is the best, especially with $4 beers from the bar.\\nI moved here from LA, and these are the best breakfast taco's I've had in nyc- and we all know how hard it is for nyc to figure out just a regular taco.

There's even an amazing vegan stew for you hipsters.\", u\"I'm from Texas, my husband is from Cali... this place is the best tacos we've had in New York. Don't @ me.\", u\"This is the place inside Brooklyn Safehouse.  Best Mexican food I've ever had on the East Coast, anywhere.

And the tacos are not like those little baby tacos, 2 tacos is a meal. Good deal and delicious! Also total bonus that they keep churning out tacos till 2am (or later)!\"], u'152.Skovorodka': [u\"TL;DR at the bottom...\\n\\nBackground: my folks grew up in the USSR, I eat food like this at home, made entirely from scratch by my mother. \\n\\nOn a family trip to NYC, my folks decided to travel the multitudinous subway stops down to Brighton Beach, to do some [window] shopping, and get some lunch before going back home. Out of the rather few eateries on Brighton, we settled on this one, as the menu was what we were looking for.\\n\\nOur expectations weren't set really high, but even if they had been set high, this restaurant would still have blown us away. Really, REALLY awesome. I'll put it to you this way: Next time I'm going to meet a friend for lunch in NYC, I will try to convince them to go here. \\n\\nExpecting portions much smaller than what was brought to the table, we ordered perhaps a little too much. While in retrospect we should have ordered less, it did let us try a lot of really awesome stuff, and kept us full for the trip back home, which was almost two hours longer than scheduled (traffic and such)\\n\\nI'd like to reiterate, that even from the Deluxe Special (Lunch) menu, portions were more than modest. A Deluxe Special would be perfect for lunch! You won't leave exploding, but it'll hold you off until dinner. \\n\\nI'll start with the bread. The pieces of bread brought to the table were of very high quality. As opposed to the under cooked play-dough many restaurants love to bring, here it was real, flavorful bread. There was a rye bread, and a white bread (but without the life processed out of it like Wonder bread) \\n\\nFor the soups, we ended up trying Green Borscht, Red Borscht, and the Mushroom soup. To those who haven't experienced Russian soups before, they are quite rich in flavor and in ingredients, they are not as simple as, say, tomato soup.\\n\\nWhile I am slightly partial to the soups made at home, these were still excellent. First and foremost, they were fresh! Potatoes in soups like these are always a tell., and they weren't at all glassy. \\n\\nAlso, in my reviews, balance is one of the things I am always screaming about, and these were certainly balanced, in all aspects. They were cooked with stock as the base, which has just the right level of oiliness. Not the dryness of being cooked in a water base, but not swimming in fat either. Everything in the soup was of perfect size too! Herbs sprinkled on top was a great touch too! Absolutely delicious! \\n\\nSpring Salad was not at all what I was expecting. Rather than get something leafy, I got cucumber, radish, and a tiny bit of grated egg, with a dressing of sour cream (much less dense than the stuff you get at the store). Same as with the soups, everything was fresh, and everything was in balance, including dressings and seasonings. \\n\\nChicken Shish Kebab was a delight! The chicken was cooked perfectly, and using dark meat meant it retained much of its juiciness/moisture. Cabbage and onions added a wonderfully fresh and slightly acidic tinge to the meal. The sauce they provide with the meat is divine! I was also extremely impressed that the onion was sweet, and not at all overpowering. \\n\\nRussian Style Chicken Cutlets were also very good. They come with the same sour cabbage salad, but the onions are mixed in with the cutlets themselves. While I did really enjoy having the onions mixed in, I would have preferred a little less mixed in, and maybe more on the side (as in the kebab)\\n\\nFries were really good, with that tiny little flaky edge great fries have. Perfectly seasoned too! Just not an inherently Russian side. \\n\\nBlintzes with farmer cheese I liked more than the ones my grandma makes (she doesn't have Yelp, please don't tell her) The cheese was delightfully sweet, and the dough was not fried through, but cooked to be soft and delicate. \\n\\nVereniki brought my mother to tears, for she had not had something like at least since leaving the USSR in 1989. They were delicate, not overly sweet, and with just the right balance of dough to filling... too often restaurants skimp on the filling, not here.\\n\\nBy the way, with the blintzes and vareniki, don't shy away from mixing the jam and sour cream. Both are mild, and combined work a duet you wouldn't expect and may enjoy more than the two solos. \\n\\nThe compote was great. Nothing like fruit punch in the US, not insanely sweet, with the fruits/berries it's made of adding an actual taste rather than the sugar overwhelming everything. \\n\\nService was terrific. Some on here comment about Russian/Soviet service, while this can be found in other eateries on Brighton, this one has top notch service, location is clean and bright too!\\n\\nOh yes, and the prices are extremely reasonable. Adding up the astonishingly good value here. \\n\\nTL: DR:\\n* Real, fresh, balanced, delicious homemade Russian food\\n* Astonishing value\\n* Great Service\\n* Great Atmosphere\\n\\nBy the way...if you were wondering... Skovorodka means Frying Pan.\", u'I came here on a weekday for lunch with a large group of about 15 people. The Russian food here was pretty average with some hits and misses. Greek salad was fresh and tossed in a nice fruity vinaigrette. Herring was great and comes with a bonus side of garlic smothered potatoes. Beef tongue was excellent, though portion was a bit stingy. Chicken kabab was juicy and expertly cooked but a bit over salted. It came with a side of delicious fried potatoes. One can never have too many potatoes! Duck salad was gross. At least I think it was duck. It tasted and looked like mystery meat.\\n\\nPrices are reasonable and service was accommodating. This place is located right outside the Brighton Beach B and Q stop pretty much directly under the train tracks. Not exactly scenic but definitely cheaper than one of the Russian places right on the boardwalk. Decor is rustic church chic. They have stained glass windows as part of their ceiling!', u\"This place is TERRIBLE. I don't understand how it has such good reviews. I'm Russian and grew up in the area. I love Russian food and haven't had a bad experience yet. Until this place. I was mislead by the glowing reviews.\\n\\nThe main issue is the food quality. \\n\\nThe stuffed cabbage came in a cream based sauce which was odd considering that it's normally a tomato and/or carrot based sauce with no cream. It was reheated and the meat inside tasted old and dry and rubbery. The rice was hardened. It was not edible.\\n\\nThe perogi were swimming in butter even though I asked for no butter. They were overcooked and the dough was watery. The meat inside was also old and rubbery.\\n\\nThe potato varenki were equally over cooked, mushy and flavorless. They usually come with delicious grilled onions. These did not. They usually have high quality mushrooms. These did not.\\n\\nWe also got the borscht. It did not have any meat or potatoes in it. That's ok since some places make it with just veggies. However, it was also missing the classic ball of bread that comes with it. The soup was overly watery and came out scorching hot (likely reheated). It did not have much flavor.\\n\\nLastly, we had a kebob plate with came with the classic potatoes and a side of slaw. The potatoes were the only thing that tasted good. The kebob meat was also rubbery and dry. The sauce that came with it was delicious but didn't help the poor meat quality. The slaw was fine. Nothing exceptional but not bad. It's usually oil based with some diced carrots and raisins both of which were missing. But it tasted fine.\\n\\nThe bread that they gave us for the table was stale.\\n\\nThe wait was rude and rushed. Despite seating us at 830pm, he told us that we're closing at 9pm and despite just bringing some dishes out, told us to hurry up and leave.\\n\\nThey add the obligatory 10% service charge which has become usually for Russian places in the area. I find it offensive because I should tip what I want. Regardless, that's not unique to this place nor is it a part of why I gave the place just one star (but I thought it worth mentioning).\\n\\nWith regard to location, it's right under the Brighton Beach stop on the B and Q lines. Very convenient to the beach also.\", u\"My partner and I came here after reading a review that said the food had made the reviewer's mother cry with joy so needless to say we had high expectations coming in. Previously I had been to a vareniki cafe around the corner but after it closed I was looking for a new spot. \\n\\nUpon entering the space, I was struck by the rustic styling combined with somewhat odd lighting in the back. It was harsh and inconsistent. The space felt a bit unused but the event equipment in the corner suggested that it might make a good spot to host a party. \\n\\nWe ordered cheese vareniki and potato vareniki as well as the Russian style chicken cutlet. The vareniki were excellent. The potato ones were served with caramelized onions and sour cream. They were as delicious as any I had eatenbefore. The cheese ones were also excellent. The chicken cutlet was less cutlet and more like mini chicken meatloaf. It was tasty but not something I would seek out again. The service was fine and there was nothing to note about it. \\n\\nOverall, a good spot that I would return to but I would seek out somewhere a little more relaxed to try first.\", u'I have been here several times for dinner with the whole family. I love the food and the service is always excellent. The food always tastes fresh and is full of flavor. It is my go to spot when I am in Brighton beach. You can come for a nice casual lunch or bring a date as it is very flexible. I have a hard time picking a favorite as we usually share a number of dishes. Sharing is the best way to get a taste of a variety of dishes. The pricing is fair so when you combine taste, service and pricing it leads to a 5 star review.', u\"We were in the mood to try something new, so we took the Q-train to Brighton Beach and chose Skovorodka for a Russian lunch. I know almost nothing about Russian food, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Skovorodka hit it out of the park.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was pretty nice considering the proximity to the elevated subway tracks. I would definitely not recommend coming here in beach gear after a day at Coney Island. Our waiter was warm and meal timing was appropriate.\\n\\nSo on to the food! I knew we had to try the Peimeini Siberian, which were plump little pockets of boiled dumpling dough stuffed with meat, and brushed with butter. Served with sour cream, they were delicious. In addition, I tried the kavkaz salad, while my husband ordered the borscht. The borscht was chunky, not a thin brothy variation. I loved the kavkaz salad, full of pickles, salty feta, and strips of cured meat. I ate around the thin slices of red onion.\\n\\nWe didn't want to overdo it, and I had a feeling the main course portion size would be large (I was right), so we split the beef stroganoff with buckwheat. This was a fantastic dish, complete with sauteed mushrooms and onions, and a creamy sauce on top. With a large menu and really really good Russian cuisine, Skovorodka has plenty to offer, and so I would recommend it to anyone.\", u'A nice change from all the trendy Russian restaurants in Brooklyn that don\\'t really serve Russian \"comfort food\" anymore.\\n\\nMy friends and I stopped by for dinner and shared a bunch of things:\\n\\nGeorgian-Style cheese pie (hachapuri)-bread + cheese = amazing, can\\'t go wrong\\nSalad Olivier\\nPelmeni Siberian\\xa0(traditional russian dumplings)-plump and juicy\\nPirogies-this were a bit too bready and greasy\\nGreek Salad\\nBeef Stroganoff-sooo creamy, soooo good\\nCouple kebabs-none of us liked the seasoning on these\\nFried potatoes with mushrooms\\n\\nThere\\'s a small dance floor and by the end of the night, there was a DJ/singer.\\n\\nOverall great option to try out some traditional Russian food.', u\"I'm Russian - born back in the USSR (you really don't know how lucky you are, boy) and have been shoving my face full of Russian food every day of my life - this is straight up legit and delicous Russian food and my favorite Russian restaurant of all time because the food tastes like it could have come from my babushka's kitchen. \\n\\nSkovorodka has all of the definitive Russian dishes except for plov which I can forgive. Over the years I've eaten everything here, my favorites are the beef stroganoff and harcho (lamb and rice soup. No lie, my significant other will brave traffic on the Belt for an indordinate amount of time just to eat their pan fried trout. \\n\\nThe service has always been Russian style which may seem rude to Americans but it is by no means on purpose, just cultural differences in the way that strangers interact with each other.\", u\"I'm a sucker for stuffed cabbage and pelmeni and Skovordka nails them both. The siberian pelmeni are excellent but the cabbage really shined. The sauce was crazy rich and the accompanying sour cream was also crazy rich adding up to the carlos slim of golubtsy.\", u'Incredible authentic Russian cuisine... The atmosphere was perfect.. Always wanted to try Borscht and it was amazing... Also the Ukrainian dumplings and the Beef Stroganoff with a side of buckwheat was a homerun..the dessert of homemade apple strudel and homemade napoleon ROCKED..... Definitely coming back', u'I am unable recommend this place due to racism.  They had 5 empty tables, one table (a 6th) table that actually had a \"RESERVED\" placard on it.  The Host refused service to me and my wife because my wife is Latina, but said they only accept customers with prior reservations.  So I asked for a reservation for Tuesday, September 5th, 2017 and the host told me \"You don\\'t need reservation that day. I told him that I am requesting a reservation, and if if he was refusing service?  He wrote my info down and we left.  As soon as we walked out, two Gentlemen were outside saying that this place had great food and open tables.  I am pretty sure he was one of the owners attempting to negate us being served.', u'I. Love. Pierogies. Or however you spell them.\\n\\nThe pierogie is a close Eastern European cousin of the Asian dumpling, and this Chinese-American loves him some dumplings, so naturally, I was on a quest to find some. My partner and I went to the Russian haven of Brooklyn - Brighton Beach - to find some, and came across this place on Yelp after many highlights and a great rave review from a fellow yelper. We were excited beyond belief to finally act on this whim (it\\'s been 6 months of salivating at the thought) and were happy to make the 4 mile bike ride down.\\n\\nWe decided on one order each of the potato and cheese vereniki (pierogie) and to share a main platter of homemade Russian style chicken cutlet. To be fair, I am not familiar with much Russian cuisine save for the American pierogie, so my review may not be that useful. The cutlets came with a side of vinegared cabbage salad and some parsley garnish. The mashed potatoe sides were perfect, but I was surprised to see the chicken \"culets\" come in the form of a chicken-loaf reshaped to be a thick chicken cutlet, pan-seared. It wasn\\'t entirely bad, it just wasn\\'t what I was expecting or originally desired. I probably wouldn\\'t get it again only because I didn\\'t think it was anything special or had any \"wow\" flavour to it that struck me as new. As for the pierogies, both resembled tortellini and came with a side of sour cream in a delightful little open lamp-like server, and in a pool of light oil. The potato variety came with caramelized onions atop, and were by far the best thing we had that night. Neither pierogi/vereniki skimped on the filling either, but the potatoe hands down was something special. I hadn\\'t realised the cheese would taste a bit sweet - resembling a cheese Danish to me. It\\'s just not to my liking, but I\\'m sure others will find it palatable.\\n\\nOverall, the meal was fine, but I would want to try other things on the menu to experiment more the flavours of Russia.', u'I\\'ll keep this short and sweet. Or short and bitter.\\n\\nWe made a reservation for six on Open Table. Got the confirmation that we were all set. Then went all the way out to Brighton Beach. Only to be told by the restaurant owner that he had \"not accepted\" the reservation. Whatever that means. Certainly Open Table has no idea what it means. \\n\\nHe said the place was full and couldn\\'t seat us. My wife asked for a recommendation for another place nearby, and he said \"What, I\\'m going to recommend one of my competitors?\"\\n\\nAnd then there was much yelling. In Russian. \\n\\nForewarned is forearmed.', u'Delicious meal with such a wonderful range of  flavors, sauces and foods beautifully prepared. All homemade. Amazing starter and entree selections. Nicest staff.  Added to our favorites list!', u\"Typical cuisine from former USSR, well executed, accompanied  by a decent service and live musician with great repertoire from yesteryear. Don't  miss on cherry stuffed vareniki dessert.\", u\"Have come here a couple times, only in the summer, and enjoyed both the red and the green borscht (the green is made with spinach and cucumber), also the delicious homemade compote. The portions are generous, and the brown bread and butter that comes with every order is filling too. I'd like to come back on a cold day for some beef stroganoff.\", u'Despite its usual popularity, it was not nearly as full as one may have expected at lunchtime. The borscht was very good, and the ranch salad (I was feeling adventurous) tasted most likely as it should have and was very filling. Perhaps I would have more to contribute had I ordered something more typical (varenyky, etc).', u\"In the hustle and bustle of Little Odessa, and the spectacle that is part of some other restaurants in this part of New York City, it might be easy to miss this place. But if it's your first time in the area or you are looking for a top notch spot to visit regularly, this is the perfect candidate for both. \\n\\nOne reason it deserves five stars: in addition to the food being perfect, the service is impeccable and only rivaled by the most expensive restaurants in the US and most traditional ones in Europe. It's not so much a cosmetic thing about their service but about their responsiveness and the quality with which it's delivered.\\n\\nThe Crepes with Red Caviar are delectable: though it could be served with a couple more crepes it does go perfectly with the bread they bring to every table anyhow. The Lobster Bisque is made so well it could make even the most experienced New England restaurants jealous. The Siberian dumplings are tender and juicy: somehow they manage to make them as rich in flavor and delivery as the much larger and similar Georgian Khinkhali.\\n\\nThe Beef Stroganoff with Couscous is popular for good reason and the Cornish Hen with Buckwheat is pure delight. \\n\\nAs with much of Little Odessa, you will feel you're abroad the entire time you are there. The restaurant's capacity seems limited by its attention to detail in the kitchen: though you'll see empty tables you can tell they turn people away based on the kitchen's workload: it's best to make a reservation and not discourage this since the food makes it well worth it! This is a great place to become familiar with Russian and Ukrainian cuisine: a great place if it's your first time in that area. The quaint environment and high standards make it a great place to entertain guests and to make a regular place to visit if you're the type to search for regular lairs in big cities. \\n\\nThey do charge a 10% service charge. The service and quality of the food summon a generous tip, but you will debate whether the 10% charge should be matched by another 10% or more. Without that service charge, your natural instinct, (if you're a good patron), might be to give more: this small detail did give some pause and could create confusion and frustration if not explained or presented in advance by the restaurant with more clarity in the future.\", u'Good service attentive workers overall excellent night with good food. Fresh food and awesome staff if you have a chance go ahead and try this cafe.', u'Highlights were the excellent soups and cured salmon.  We also appreciated the warm hospitality of the owner.  The entertainment was a plus.  Would like to come back!'], u'156.Tchoup Shop': [u\"One of my favorite places to eat in Brooklyn; when I'm craving my hometown spice. I'm from New Orleans. This is the best place, I've eaten in NYC with a New Orleans style menu. My favorite is the crawfish Mac & cheese & the pepper jelly chicken biscuit. Sooo good! Red beans & crawfish bread also is a must!\", u\"Was really excited about the new orleans style menu. \\n\\nEverything on it sounded amazing. \\n\\nThe best dishes were really bland and the worst were cold in the middle (I'm looking at you crawfish bread, covered in barely melted supermarket mozzarella) \\n\\nI'm sure this place would be fine for drinks. Really don't recommend it for a meal.\", u\"Suuuuuuure. If you like hair strands on your jambalaya and a surly lunch server to boot. (And good luck trying to get her to acknowledge that you're doing her a favor by pointing out that they need to step up with their food hygiene game) \\n\\nAnd did I mention the toilet?!?!?!?!?\", u\"Great gumbo and it's free with a Check in with a purchase of an entree.  The handmade sausages are !!  I also ordered the deviled eggs, I'll be back here to dine, great food!\", u\"Yum! I'd been craving some good creole/cajun food for a while, so Tchoup caught my eye when I was searching for lunch places in the Bushwick area! Since my friend also mentioned that he'd had his eye on this place for a while, we agreed to check it out! Despite the freezing cold, I'm glad that I ventured out this way.\\n\\nAs others have mentioned, it shares a space with the Heavy Woods bar (remind you of any particular NOLA po' boy shop??), and during lunch we were given the option of sitting in the dining area in the back or sitting at the bar area up front. The only issue with sitting in the bar area is that you have to order at the bar, which isn't a huge deal at all. Plus, lighting is much better in the front.\\n\\nThe menu is inclusive of most popular cajun/creole dishes. I had the chicken and andouille sausage jambalaya, cheese grits, and a piece of my friend's battered catfish from his po' boy. Don't be fooled by the small serving size of the jambalaya (cup) - it is very heavy and will most definitely fill you up. My friend's battered catfish po' boy was a great option too. The catfish was really well done! It was super crispy but not burnt or overly greasy. If you are here with a group, I'd definitely recommend ordering their appetizers/sides to share. The cheese grits I shared with my friend was the perfect little somethin' extra for our meal and we were both able to enjoy it along side our own dishes without wasting any food!\\n\\nI will definitely be back to try out their brunch menu!\", u\"Oh boy, where do I even start?!\\n\\nFirst off, check in and get that gumbo! I loved it sooo much, and if you like heat, you'll love the gumbo even more!\\n\\nNow we gotta talk about the drinks. I'm a sucker for bloody marys, so reading that sign outside was the green light for me to go in and check the place out.\\n\\nThen, of course, the bartender gave us a menu full of things I wanted to devour. It didn't help me at all with the decision process. And then he slapped us in the face with a good special they were offering that day. Like seriously now, how do I decide on what to get?\\n\\nSo we finally decided. My friend got the Shrimp Special of the day that came with salad and dessert; I got the Angry Hippy; and fianc\\xe9 got the Holy Shit-ake. My friend's meal was good. She loved it! I enjoyed mine a lot, but fianc\\xe9 felt that ours tasted very similar with a couple of tweaks. Nonetheless, I absolutely enjoyed. My tummy was very very happy.\\n\\nI will definitely check this place out again--as long as the Gumbo check-in and bloody mary deal is still on!\", u\"The restaurant wasn't bad and it wasn't great.  It was in between.  We passed this place because it actually says something completely different, there's no sign that says Tchoup Shop, I forgot what it said - but it wasn't that.\\n\\nWe had a variety of food, the burger was incredible.  I was really satisfied about that.  The prices are CRAZY EXPENSIVE.  That is one main reason I wouldn't come back.  It's nice they have outside seating and a gatorade cooler to fill your water with.... Random, but different, and so much better than waiting for the staff to come around and fill your cup while you're dying of thirst.\\n\\nWe didn't like the Gumbo so much, but that was the most disappointing thing.  It didn't have much flavor and my cook of a friend said it tasted like something that just came out of a can, which he was right.\\n\\nLike I said, everything was delicious but I wouldn't come back due to the prices and small portions of food.\", u'We shared the shrimp and grits, the gumbo, and the banana walnut bread with nutella butter. Flavors were great all around. I would recommend any of those dishes. The portions were on the smaller deal, but I felt the value was fair when including the free gumbo which comes with a yelp check-in.\\n\\nMy favorite dish was the shrimp and grits. The grits were creamy yet not overly cheesy. There was plenty of tender shrimp. The dish also had mushrooms, crispy bacon, and scallions. Altogether, it was vibrant and delicious.', u\"This was such a great find, definitely tops my list for best louisiana food in NYC. \\n\\nIt has always been a struggle to find restaurants which offer the authentic taste of louisiana cuisine in NYC, so looks like my search has finally come to an end. Looking at the food pictures, we specially saved one Saturday to visit Tchoup. We arrived around noon and the place was bustling with brunch crowd. We didn't had to wait long for a table.\\n\\nTchoup is divided into two sections, first section has the bar and some seating...the backroom has majority of seating for sit down meals. We ordered duck okra gumbo, crispy chicken biscuit and jambalaya. \\n\\nGumbo and crispy chicken biscuit were out of this world, just plain delicious. They were finger licking good. Texture and flavors of the crispy chicken biscuit was one of the best I have had till date. Jambalaya though good but was on a dry side.\\n\\nOverall food and service was on point, definitely a great spot for brunch. They have DJ's on thursday nights which adds up one more reason to swing by here!!\", u\"I honestly didn't even think this was the place, I thought it was just a bar. I had this place bookmarked for a while since I love Cajun/Creole food and I have been trying to find something similar in the New York area. I thought Tchoup Shop was just OK, I think the biggest issue I had with all the dishes was the salt factor.\\n\\nThe food:\\n\\nGumbo- This came along with a Yelp check in which was awesome. It was one of the better Yelp offers but I think it came off rather salty and it was kinda too mild in flavor, I did enjoy the piece of duck, though. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=PbWgDLf69z3-gLAPATvwAg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\\n\\nBrisket-Duck Liver Boudin Balls- Creole mustard, handmade pickles. I am a big fan of boudin but the ones here were just OK. The flavor wasn't really pronounced. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mpLVTBTSQh9r6v-UWbn44A&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\\n\\nShrimp N' Grits- Bacon, hedge hog mushrooms. I enjoyed the overall flavor of the shrimp and grits but it was salty for me, I also thought the texture of the polenta was way too thick. I did, however, really enjoyed the shrimp and the bacon was also a nice addition. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mF3weEsK2ncLX9t-ecd0vg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\\n\\nRed Eyed Bandit- Eggs, tasso, biscuit n' sausage gravy. I thought this dish was going to be an automatic winner, it was also one that the waiter recommended, I liked the flavor of the dish but it came off pretty heavy and greasy. The chicken cutlet was nice with the gravy but there wasn't a lot of flavor and the gravy was salty. I did enjoy the biscuit. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=sKuOH7vqzR_uviCAJ9QPMg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\", u\"Hidden in the back of Heavy Woods (no signs on the outside) is a solid little bastion of NOLA, from it's fine food to it's permissive drinking culture and dinky ish appearance. jk it looks fine. Anyways, come for the very good duck and okra gumbo, think about leaving with the chicken biscuit sandwich that is too heavily slatherd in a sweet sauce, and stay for the $8 beer/shot deals. This would be a great place to do a full day of drinking and eating with almost no moving.\", u\"I've tried the boudin balls, gumbo, catfish po boy here. I've also tried bites of the slow roasted pork po boy, cocktails, and the grits with some sort of thick bacon when friends got them. \\n\\nFrom these experiences, my biggest recommendation would be not to go here during odd hours. At odd hours, this place only have their regular menu. During dinner though, they'll have a daily special menu that accompanies it and gives you many more options. There's maybe one option on the regular menu without meat, and none of you'd like to avoid meat and diary for the meal. \\n\\nTheir gumbo is amazing and this is the one thing I would recommend to anyone. Boudin balls are quite tasty as well. The catfish po boy off the regular menu was actually pretty disappointing. The catfish did not appear to be freshly cooked and it barely had any taste. So biggest tip -- gumbo!!\", u'My bff and I stopped here after being turned away from a special event a couple blocks down. Boy am I glad we stopped in. The catfish po boy is so good along with the cheese grits. And the ice coffee is great as well.  I will venture down here again.', u\"Came here for brunch with little sister, it was ok.\\nFood was bland, our server (Tall guy) was kind even though he forgot our drinks. \\n\\nI enjoy going to family owned business and all, atleast that's the impression I got with the kids running around and peeking into their small kitchen. But what ultimately sacrificed a 3 star rating was the chef who looked extremely dirty. His stomach and all his warts were exposed and he had a terrible rash all over his hands which made my stomach turn. He was scratching himself and proceeded back to the kitchen. I definitely won't be back I'm sorry def a deal breaker when as a consumer you always wonder what goes on behind the kitchen but for it to be exposed all out there for me was bad.\", u'Still not sure how to pronounce the name but hey the Gumbo was A-OK! Nicely portioned and properly seasoned enough to get me thinking about time spent in the Cajun country.', u\"I'm so glad this place is in Brooklyn! It's a few steps from the train station. \\n\\nThe place is dark but the music is good! It's like a 90's throwback in there. \\n\\nI ordered the duck gumbo-cup size but it was definitely enough for me. I don't duck so picked it out. It was a flavorful broth served on white rice. It had enough spice for me but I could have added some hot sauce. I think the best part of the gumbo was the sausage. But the really interesting part about this was the crisp pork skin pieces. \\n\\nYou have to get the biscuits cause they are amazing. Very crispy on the outside but fluffy enough on the inside. Get two though cause they're small. \\n\\nWe also had the chicken fried pork steak. This is a safe choice cause the flavors are simple but it was good. The mashed potato and gravy served with it was just enough to accompany the pork. \\n\\nOh and the lemonade tasted very fresh but it was definitely tart.\", u\"Finally made our way to Bushwick and got to try out this gem. Sunday brunch was easy breezy. No wait and easy parking. Service was on point and attentive. Iced coffee was nice and strong. Free gumbo with check in was a great treat. Started with the liver balls which was a first but good. Crab cakes were delicious but salad was a little salty for my taste. Also had the chicken fried pork which was supper tasty. Everything from the gravy to the biscuit was flavorful. Can't wait to come back and try more! Bushwick flea is right next door so that's always a treat for some vintage shopping.\", u'As a southern belle, this spot is a gem to have in the neighborhood when craving comfort food. The crawfish Mac and cheese is heavenly. I always start with the spicy margarita.', u'My friends and I wandered in here after going to see the Bushwick Collective. It is a nice cozy shop with both bar and lounge seating. We had high expectations because of the good reviews. Two of us ended up ordering the Crispy Chicken Biscuit and the gumbo (which was free for checking in. Thanks Yelp!) Our other friend ordered the quiche. \\n\\nThe gumbo was definitely the only highlight of the meal. It had a nice kick to it and the duck was stewed perfectly. The chicken biscuits were very meh. The sauce on them tasted great but the biscuit was hard like a rock and the chicken was tough and difficult to chew. It was disappointing to pay $8 for a tiny, hard biscuit that left us hungry and unsatisfied. The quiche was just okay. There are definitely better brunch spots around.', u'The delicious taste of New Orleans far far away in Brooklyn!!  All my NOLA favorites, gumbo, jambalaya, red beans and rice, and even pecan praline bread pudding!!'], u'75.The Food Sermon Kitchen': [u\"History:\\nI feel food Sermon has been around for a while even when I was in College. I just was either too engulfed in my work at school to notice or I was just to lazy to walk down the street to enjoy the food that comes out of that establishment. \\nFood Sermon is located in a very historical area of Brooklyn Crown Heights to be exact. Food Sermon isn't not too far from a lot of historical schools as well such as Clara Barton H.S., Medgar Evers Prep, and Medgar Evers College. Food Sermon is also 2 blocks down from Ebbets Field where the Brooklyn Dodgers used to play from 1913 to 1957. \\nIf you take a stroll around the area you'll notice that a lot of streets are named after famous ppl ppl that built a legacy for themselves and Honorary delegates whom made a serious impact on the community. \\nFor such a small place it gets the crowd from different parts of NY and out of state. \\n\\nPros:\\nFood here is very filling. \\nThis place is small but, it produces excellent rich food. \\nSundays are it's most busiest day because they make up for Saturday which they are closed which is understandable. Certain bowls or dishes are pricier than others side but; the food is 5 star so the prices make up for it. It was also pricey because I ordered 3 to go plates. I was greedy! \\nFood Sermon is a Church Sermon that is a blessing to my stomach. \\n\\nCons:\\nFood Sermon is very small.\", u\"I have been trying to eat at The Food Sermon for a while now. They have sort of strange hours which never seemed to coincide with my schedule - they are closed Friday night and Saturday all day and they don't open til 2 on Sundays. They are open weeknights 5-10, but not for lunch during the week. The hours are really the only downside of the restaurant.\\n\\nOnce I finally had the food, I figured out how they could stay in business with such scant weekend hours. The food is good. It's realllllly good. Based on older reviews, it looks like they may have had a larger selection in the past - I see mention of roti, etc. Now the menu is quite limited and simple. \\n\\n1. Choose your protein (lamb, jerk chicken, salmon, tofu/veg)\\n2. Choose your bean (kidney or chick pea)\\n3. Choose your rice (brown or white)\\n4. Choose your sauce (spicy tomato or coconut ginger)\\n\\nThat's pretty much it. There are some vegetable sides, but there aren't any apps, soups, etc. At first, I was a little bummed about the lack of variety but once I had the food, I can see why they chose to limit the selection. Everything is made with such precision and love and it's really perfect.\\n\\nThe lamb shank is $18 and is gigantic. I don't know where else you can get such a gourmet item at that price point. It is cooked to perfection and falls off the bone, perfect and tender. The jerk chicken is $13 and delectably spicy. I got the coconut ginger sauce on the chicken and the spicy tomato sauce on the lamb - next time I would probably switch it up. \\n\\nI can't wait to come back and try the salmon. I never get salmon in restaurants, but I have a feeling it would be perfect with that coconut ginger sauce. Mmmmm. \\n\\nI left super satisfied - the portions are big - but everything seemed so clean and healthy and I didn't feel greasy or weighed down by my meal. The Food Sermon has a convert!\", u'My friend has been raving about this place for months.  So, we finally got a chance to go.  Growing up in a Caribbean household, I am biased and critical about caribbean restaurants.  However, the food here is delicious.  I also appreciate the attention to detail, the food presentation is amazing.  \\n\\nWhat I ordered:\\nJerk Chicken (nice flavor and it is actually spicy)\\nWhite rice/ red beans\\nCoconut ginger sauce\\nSorrel \\n\\nGreat portion size, I was stuffed trying to eat everything.  This will definitely be one of my regular restaurants to visit.', u\"Food Sermon is special. I think I learn a bit more about the space and the vision each time I visit. I believe they started purely for catering purposes, but transitioned into a restaurant following the demand. I don't get to go often, and have only been twice as they've been closed on a few occasions I tried to stop in. The food is Caribbean inspired and from what I understand, the menu has seen quite a few changes since it's inception. \\n\\nThe current menu features rice bowls with choice of lamb shank, jerk chicken, or pan-seared tofu. My mouth is watering thinking about it! This comes with a choice of coconut ginger or spicy tomato sauce and Market vegetables. On both visits, I chose the spicy tomato with tofu. I'm a saucy girl, and would've loved if there was more sauce. But the food was still delicious; the flavours really pop. I pretty much inhaled my bowl and accordingly wished the serving size was a tad bigger. The jerk chicken and lamb are hefty portions, but the tofu only comes with three slices of tofu and leaves me wanting more. \\n\\nThe sorrel is very light but I also wouldn't expect my Trinidadian mother's Christmas sorrel here.\\n\\nIt's BYOB also, so also feel free to come with a beer. We went the wine route. The cashier is pleasant and it's a small but well utilised space with a communal table and high counter seating-open kitchen with lovely island vibe interior.\", u\"Great food great atmosphere...the people were extremely friendly. We're from LA and this was our first time here. We were not disappointed. Amazing flavorful food.\", u\"Absolutely a hidden gem in Brooklyn! Well, I'm not familiar with Brooklyn but this place makes me want to come back!\\n\\nThe store has its unique atmosphere. Wooden tables, very cool staff who tells you the exact time of wait before you order. So basically you choose the protein (fish, chicken or lamb) and then your toppings and sauce. We got one order chicken and one of lamb with different sauce for each. They were both so good. The fish is seared salmon, very fresh and has baked crumbs on top. The chicken is grilled chicken, fully flavored and goes so well with everything in the bowl. Did I mention they make their own hot sauce as well, bottled ones? \\n\\nOverall it's a bit pricey but totally worth it.\", u\"It's great!  I thought surely I had left a review for this place back when they opened and I popped in to see what this shiny new business was at the end of my block.  I fell in love then and am still there today.\\n\\nThe menu has gone through a few renovations since opening as you can see from my old pictures to now but the flavor is still consistently amazing.  These guys from St Vincent and the Grenadines do it right!  It's all of your West Indian cuisine favorites packed (in very generous portions) into gastronomically sound servings and selections. I'm big on the jerk chicken with the coconut ginger sauce. Do get this add then hit it with the spicy pepper sauce, but don't go too crazy if you're not with the spice because it will punch  you.  I also had the pleasure of tasting the tofu (thanks vegetarian girlfriend) and I would actually order it and enjoy if I were fasting from meat.  The red tomato based sauce is also a tasty alternative which I'd like to try on the chicken or goat the next time (with the pepper sauce too of course).\\n\\nFinally do try the Sorrell. It's tasty.  I haven't had the pleasure of the other beverage options. Take it go because it travels well or take a seat at one of the large communal tables and make a few new friends through few words and a lot of chewing with your head down.\", u\"If you're reading this review, wondering if you should eat at Food Sermon, put down the phone and GO! You will not be disappointed! I had the lamb shank which was super tender and flavorful with rice and chick peas and coconut ginger sauce. I damn near wanted to lick the bowl clean. I tried my  partner's jerk chicken and it was good. But if you're a lamb lover like me, lamb is the way to go. Can't wait to go back and try the, you guessed it, lamb with the other sauce, beans and veggie options!\", u\"I picked up dinner for 2 friends and myself the other night and was not disappointed. I got brown rice, chickpeas, and jerk chicken with the coconut ginger sauce and it was AWESOME. I wish I could get food from here more often. Everything was flavorful and cooked perfectly. Their kale is also very good and I would live off their roasted potatoes if I could. \\n\\nMy only complaint is it's a little difficult to time. I've read reviews that it took people 30-40 minutes to get their food after they just walked in to order, so I tried to call ahead and schedule an order for pick-up. The guy told me that he couldn't estimate when food would be ready and that if I wanted to place an order over the phone, I couldn't schedule when I wanted to pick it up - it would be ready when it was ready. That's a little frustrating and I find it hard to believe they can't figure out how to have an order ready an hour from the time a customer calls. \\n\\nTheir hours are a little wonky but if you can find the time to go when they're open, it's well worth the money!\", u'Exceptionally delicious Caribbean cuisine. Even in the Caribbean, you will have a hard time finding such a great taste. Simple small corner shop serves a step-by-step simple menu. Chicken, fish, lamb, vegetarian. That\\'s it. I picked brown rice, red beans, lamb shanks with a glass of sorrel. Maan, once you make your choice, you cannot imagine the intensity of the taste carnival waiting for you. After finishing your food, you understand why they call this little restaurant \"The Food Sermon\". If you are a food connoisseur and searching for a unique taste, you have to bookmark The Food Sermon. By the way, check out the decoration of the bathroom. Lovely. The only missing part was a smooth beats from Peter Tosh. One love.', u'Came here after walking around the Brooklyn botanical garden on a hot day.  The staff could not be nicer and the food was amazing.  My friend and I both had the island bowls, one with spicy tomato and one with coconut ginger.  The jerk chicken was perfectly seasoned and moist, the whole meal was amazing!  Every bit as good as it looks.', u'I ordered  both the jerk chicken ad the salmon bowl with white rice and kidney beans (coconut ginger sauce). I made my order to go, and there was about a 15-20 minute wait. The food tasted really flavorful without being too heavy and the portions were pretty big. I would definitely recommend!', u'I walked almost a mile to get here. They were about to close and still let me order! The staff is amazing! The food is just as good!', u\"WHO: moi\\nWHY: recommendation of my sister\\nWHAT: (Deets) I ordered the Lamb, brown rice, red beans and coconut ginger sauce. The on-the-bone sweet lamb meat was fall-off-the-bone tender(no knife needed), and perfectly seasoned. It's tipped with bread crumbs, to add texture and a nice crunch, and a green cilantro sauce. The red beans and rice were good with the coconut ginger sauce, but I will likely pair the sauce with the chick peas the next time around. To drink, I had the sorrel. It was a bit lemony for my taste. I'll skip it next time. There is plenty of tap water available at this (mostly) self-serve establishment. There are single seaters (and outlets) near the window for people watching and such. There is also a bench & a high top for parties of 4-6/ table. I like the repurposed wood and rustic feel of the place. The art and old school calypso and reggae were kool too.\\nWHEN: dinnertime Thursday 3/30/17\\nWHERE: dine-in\\nHOW: car/ bike/ public transportation B44\\nbus trains\\nBATHROOM: gender neutral\\nWIFI: beats me\\nDRESS CODE: casual\\nSERVICE: thank you for your hospitality Vaughn (sp?). \\nBOTTOM LINE: I'm going back. I enjoyed the food.\\nTIP: try the BBQ sauce\", u\"So I'm gonna get straight to the point. The food they have coming out of this kitchen is great. The one thing I appreciate is their focus on what they do well and sticking to it (meaning, the menu does not have a lot of variety but enough to satisfy island folk looking for some good cooking. And like i said, it was great!!)\\n\\nI've had the food sermon kitchen bookmarked as a place i needed to visit for the past year and just never found myself in that part of Brooklyn when they were open. Today though, I made it a point to get over there. My wife ordered and I waited in the car, so i cannot speak on the service first hand. However, she knows the general manager from back in the day and he so happened to be working today. Came from the back when he recognized her and exchanged pleasantries.\\n\\n\\nWe ordered the jerk chicken bowl with white rice, red beans and the coconut ginger sauce (no pic, sorry) & the lamb shank with brown rice, red beans, a side of kale and the coconut ginger sauce. We ordered to go since we had to trek back to the island and I really didn't want to waste time trying to eat in. We decided that we would crack one of the bowls (to go box) and the lucky winner was the jerk chicken bowl...holy cow. The flavor in that thing is something to preach about. There was a nice kick to it and the addition of the coconut ginger sauce?!?! (Faints in disbelief). Lol. It was that good. When we got home I cracked open the lamb shank box/bowl and the meat just fell off. My wife loved the kale. Now, if I had to choose, I would say the jerk chicken was the best (yea, I've read the other reviews praising the lamb shank as the best meal on the menu, but I may have to disagree on that one)....\\n\\nOk, let me stop typing. You need to get this restaurant as soon as possible. It's a crying shame if you don't.\", u'Amazing!!!! I had the Jerk Chicken Bowl with the Ginger Coconut Sauce and Red Beans. The flavors married beautifully together. The presentation was pleasing and just all around vibe and decor was great. I will definitely come back.', u'The. Food. Is. Sooooooooo. Good!!!\\n\\nI almost licked the bowl when I was done. (mama raised me better than that) However I did beg and asked to take the bowl home. Owner was gracious and gently took his bowl from my prying hands. I had to wait 15-20 minutes for my dish and it was worth it. Come hongry and leave a tip because not only is the staff hospitable, they are cute AF.', u\"Three words - real life food. All of it was delicious: kale, button mushrooms, carrots, snow peas, garbanzo beans, brocoli, nicely seasoned tofu, all atop a bed of delicious brown rice. The sauces are ridiculous, for my bowl I had the coconut ginger but also tried the spicy tomato and both were perfectly suited for the food. Don't sleep on that hot sauce either, it packs a punch!\\n\\nMy only complaint is that some of the veggies (brocoli and snow peas) seemed like they were cooked a tad too long. That being sad, the flavor was never compromised, and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here. Got takeout so didn't spend time inside but I do know that it was intended to be a stand alone catering business. So glad we are able to partake in non-catered situations! \\n\\nSide note - I've heard meat is a good option here although the owner was raised vegetarian! I wouldn't eat it, but I've heard rave reviews. Good food = happy soul.\", u'Get the lamb.... \\n\\nJust. Get. The. Lamb\\n\\nGreat atmosphere, beautiful food and great staff.', u\"Food Sermon is a caribbean take on the Chipotle model of food. Make a limited menu of items and serve it in a limited combination of dishes. \\n\\nI got the Jerk Chicken on a spicy tomato sauce over rice and beans. First thing's first: this isn't the jerk chicken you're used to if you actually like Carribbean food. \\n\\nIt's all meat, its missing the smokey skin so you don't get the true flavor that comes from the Jerk sauce and rub. The spicy tomato sauce was also... not very spicy. But I will point out this about the tomato sauce: it's not really my type  of thing (not a fan of tomatoes), but I haven't seen it anywhere else. \\n\\nThey do have a separate pepper sauce that you can use and that one is quite spicy, but overall it's clear that the demographic for the Food Sermon Kitchen is white people. \\n\\nThe food is sanitized, it's safe, it appears exotic but really isn't. And it costs $14 for a decent portion that you can finish in one sitting. For about $10 you can get enough Jerk chicken at any other Caribbean eatery to make you sick of chicken for an entire week. \\n\\nWhich is to say : Food Sermon serves gentrified Carribbean food. The food is good but it's not a great value and not going to be what you're used to in terms of Caribbean food.\"], u'122.Boil Boil Ramen': [u'Fast, friendly and pretty good. Small pop up style spot. Good pricing and made to order. Large portions too. Not a lot of drink options and seating is somewhat uncomfortable but I still go here often', u'Pretty sure one or more of the reviews below are paid shilling. The ramen was nothing better than something a college student could do in 10 minutes flat, the char siu was tough pulled pork and tap water was \"not drinkable\" - a first in New York! \\n\\nThere are decent Japanese options all around the city, and this isn\\'t one of them - do yourself a favor and avoid this.', u\"Came in on a calm Wednesday afternoon and this place saved the day. Industry City is a confusing maze, but there are some gems hidden in the corners! I had the veggie ramen (umami shoyu) and it was glorious to the max. Perfect noodle texture, savory and pretty good broth. The egg was just how I liked it, a little wetness in the yolk but not too much, just the right amount (big deal for me!). With the addition of the crispy vegetables, I was in heaven. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is that I've had a slightly better taste on the broth.\\n\\nThey are fast and friendly here, and you can even sit and enjoy your meal in the restaurant while you watch them make more dishes. It's reasonably priced and you will be fully satisfied after the meal. Enjoy!\", u\"I came to IC for the first time and came upon Boil Boil Ramen....OMG!! The soup I had was sssooo good...the veggies,noodles,egg,pieces of pork and what ever else they put in it but the broth and seasoning was what made the soup!!!...I couldn't get enough of it...that was my first time having ramen noodles made that way... I really enjoyed it...I went back today just for more...one sit and eat there and the other to take home and to my dismay it was CLOSED!!! Heart broken...I must go back to satisfy this taste in my mouth\", u'I was at IC today for the sample sale and decided to stop by for a quick bite. I already tried their ramen when they were at Broadway bite and it was delicious. I asked if they had the burger because I wanted to try it last time but it was sold out. They had it this time and needless to say, it did not disappoint at all. They portion of the burger was big. Very filling. The pork was tender and juicy. Great combination with a tartness of the pineapple and lightness of the lettuce. Hopefully they will have more locations soon.', u\"The best ramen in Brooklyn's hands down! Much better than Ichiran or IPPUDO which cost 3 times as much. Their pork broth is slow cooked for over 10 hours, no MSG as I never feel thirsty after licking out every last drop of their broth. Service is friendly and also very fast. I get my ramen within 2 minutes.\", u'The noodles are very good. The textures are perfect, and the soup I really want to drink the last drop. The spicy miso ramen is must try and soba salad is perfect for summer. go for it.', u'Really good ramen however inconsistent quality unfortunately . Ingredients sometimes feel fresh and delicious while other times dried out and limp. The Pork ramen is generally always very good however recently we have noticed the pork is dry and chewy and the amount of add ins seems to be reduced. We eat here at least 2xs a week and want them to succeed but they need to focus on quality ingredients and consistent platting.'], u'23.Nargis Bar & Grill': [u\"So my friends and I have been going to the original location for years. It's been our go-to for everything that comes up in our lives- venting over great food. Anyway, we decided to check this place out to see how it compares. And it was such a great experience. \\n\\nWhen you walk in, you get the option to sit by the bar, but we chose to sit in the backyard. The view was absolutely amazing!! And the food was just as good as it is at the original location. The sonly twice was excellent, and the location is great too. All in all, we will definitely be coming back.\", u\"On a Saturday night with a party of 4, we were able to easily secure a table at 730p.  Things were busy, but there didnt see to be a line.\\n\\nWe ordered a medley of dishes to share with the table - green salad, beef noodle soup, pumpkin dumplings, beef dumplings, 3 skewers (chicken, lamb, ground beef + lamb) and some bread.  Everything was very very tasty.  My Eastern European wife said the meal reminded her of home.  \\n\\nPrices are very fair for the quality and quantity of food.\\n\\nService is friendly, but a bit abrupt.  The staff is on your case to order and clear dishes in a blink of an eye.  They're not pushy, its just a cultural thing.\\n\\nWe will be back!\", u\"Early Saturday evening wanted something cold in a glass. We aimed for another famed restaurant in the strip. As usual Saturday they're booked, 20-30 minute wait. So..we left that famed restaurant and found this place.  The decor is nice,  outside seating looked very accommodating.\\nThis was pretty much our introduction to Uzbek food. It was refreshing to have  grilled vegetables plate along with hummus and roasted eggplant.  The chicken kabab was ok. But the star of the show was...the bread! Hot and crusty, with warm butter very appetizing. Unbeknownst to us, \\nWe found out from the staff and from a friend who actually speaks Uzbek.  This restaurant has an original location in coney island and has more authentic food and is much  cheaper.  So we look forward to trying out that location. \\nWhy 3 stars..they were open, and why not take a chance.\", u'Thrilled to have Nargis in the neighborhood! This new outpost of the popular and well-known Uzbek spot has a beautiful outdoor garden in back and serves delicious food. The service was also great and Anna, the manager, was warm and friendly. We loved everything we tried, especially the dumplings and the plov (rice dish with lamb). Ask for their hot sauce on the side, which was also great and flavorful. Also extremely reasonably priced for the amount of food! We had lots left over.', u\"Normally we head to the mother ship--their original location on Coney Island Ave. Late last year, we heard Nargis is opening a second location in Park Slope. It was supposed to open in late spring, so we waited patiently. And finally they opened in early September!\\n\\nWe (hubby, sis and BIL) wandered in and were promptly seated. The space occupies two storefronts, with one being mostly a bar area and the other being full seating. Decor from the old country hung across modern brick walls. It's a nice space that feels open without getting cheesy.\\n\\nWe ended up ordering a sampler platter (filled with hummous, a couple eggplant varieties, kimchi and a couple other things), non (which is basically the same as Turkish pide), plov and chuchvara. We had at it with the platter, which was tasty and pretty filling. Though it's not listed on the menu, when my BIL asked if they can just serve us an appetizer of baba ganoush, they happily obliged. Plov is the national Uzbek dish and this version wasn't too oily, plus the (lamb) meat was even better than at the other location. Chuchvara are tiny little meat-filled dumplings served with fried onions and a big dollop of sour cream on the side. One of my favorite Uzbek dishes and this one didn't disappoint. Oh, and we had compot, a fruit drink that's excellent.\\n\\nDespite being open less than a week, service was on point. They took our order relatively quickly and the food came out pretty fast. We overheard the wait staff explaining to other tables what certain things are so there's no need to be intimidated.\\n\\nCompared to the original location, the menu is not nearly as extensive--probably just under half the items, but unless you're very familiar with Uzbek dishes, you won't really notice this. Also the prices are a bit higher, which is understandable being Park Slope. We didn't order the kebabs here because it was pretty much double the price vs 20-30% more. So if you're familiar with the first location, heads up.\\n\\nI recommend going in a group. You'll definitely want to share a few different dishes to get a taste.\", u'Love this place!\\nBeautiful decor in the inside, big outdoor seating in the back with waterfall, all food amazing , great service!\\nNice bar area as you walk in to the restaurant, and then they have a second room with the seating area...\\nTry there Turkish liver, avocado salad, chuchvara (handmade beef dumpling), Potatoes with mushrooms, and of course there grilled meats!!!', u'This place is fire. The Fresh Salad was similar to a Greek aggorountomata - delicious. The two types of Samsa, meat and pumpkin, were easily my favorite items on the menu. I would go back just to have the pumpkin Samsa. The chuchvara were similar to small Chinese wontons and the caramelized onions were so good. Salmon kebab skewers were cooked perfectly and the chicken kebabs (both on the bone and off the bone) were some of the most tender chicken I have ever had. My first time having Uzbek cuisine and I must have it again.', u'Great service. Great food. Awesome atmosphere. The rice dish was really great. Go LAMB.', u\"The food and drinks are delicious. The place is nice and cozy. And the waiters were awesome. I'm definitely going back.\", u'Wonderful experience Exellent food I heard they opened this second location so I came here and tried with my family and we all loved it everything was fresh I love uzbeki food I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.', u\"So happy this opened in the neighborhood. I'm a big fan of the original location as well.\\n\\nThey just opened so I was given an inordinate amount of attention, but everyone was very nice.\\n\\nFood was great - portions of salad and side were huge. I ordered a tomato salad, side ('home fries' with mushrooms) and one lamb kebab, and there was bread - I took about half home. Good value, especially for park slope.\\n\\nTip: order your kebab about 10-15 minutes before you want to eat it, not when ordering starters. It will come out too quick otherwise.\", u'I grow up in middle East and I know what a good uzbek food should taste like.\\nHands down one of the best Uzbek food I ever had.\\nChef big B you are doing an amazing job!!!\\nKeep it up.', u\"What can I say? I've been dragging people to their original spot for years. I have NEVER, EVER taken a friend there who didn't absolutely love it. Fresh, original salads, unbelievable dumplings, killer kebabs....and the list goes on.\\n\\nNow the great news (at least for me) is that the new Park Slope spot doesn't disappoint in any way and it's a whole lot closer for me! The same attention to detail, in service and food, that Chef Boris has been dishing out for years. The quality of the ingredients, the unique and original flavors all shine here. If you know nothing about Uzbeki cuisine this is the place from which to start (and end!) your culinary journey.\\n\\nAll this delivered in a beautifully appointed room filled with art imported from Uzbekistan. The spot opened only recently and is in a part of Brooklyn where there are many great food options. That said I've been back 5-6 times since they've opened. It'll probably be 10 by the time October is over.\\n\\nAlso, with colder weather approaching order the Lagman soup. Unreal flavors and hand pulled noodles. It doesn't get any better.....\", u\"This was our first time here and WOW!  They impressed us.  They first impressed us with their wonderful service (they brought us out an appetizer on the house!).  And then, they impressed us with delicious drinks.  Lastly, they impressed us with their incredibly delicious food.  We got a lot of different things and all tried each other's food.  We personally got the Samsa (both the meat and the pumpkin), the lamb chop kabob and the Chuchvara (beef dumplings).  We got the non bread too.  At the table, the ox tail soup, lamb kabobs, and french fries were ordered too.  All of that was amazing!  The Fig Time drink was perfect too.  Can't go wrong when an actual fig is INSIDE the circle ice cube!  Can't wait to come back again soon.\", u'The ambience is pleasant. The staff are very friendly. The backyard is lovely.\\nI only ordered the chicken kebab which consisted of 4 juicy pieces of white meat slightly over-priced at 8$, since it came only with a tasty dipping sauce and some seasoned raw onion-NO BREAD.\\nI will return for a fuller meal, but I will not order the 5$ Diet Coke. 5$ for a Diet Coke.\\nHopefully, the owner will realize that even people in park slope do not like paying 5$ for a Diet Coke and will lower the price.', u\"I am so glad Nargis is located at park slope!. I am so proud of my hometown cooking. I invited my friends for my birthday lunch today. They enjoyed the food very much. My favorite food are Uzbek plov, pumpkin manti, variable kebabs and more. All foods are good! You won't be disappointed with your appetite!!  Beautiful atmosphere! A must to be there! Definitely would go again.\", u\"The food here is delicious and authentic. I came in one evening for take out and realized that I had accidently ordered from their other restaurant in Coney Island. They were super nice about it and allowed me to cancel my order and reorder at their restaurant. The food came out quickly and was tasty. The lamb kebab was tender and the sauce that came with it was perfect. I'll definitely come back to eat in the restaurant. The atmosphere was cool and unique.\", u\"What a treasure! And it is just steps from our apartment. \\n\\nWe have eagerly awaited the opening of this Uzbeki restaurant, and we were not disappointed. We went on the second day they were open, and for my wife's birthday.\\nGreat grilled meats (the liver was superb), dumplings, excellent salads, and fresh bread made on the premises. I would thoroughly recommend this for an authentic experience in casual, relaxed surroundings!\", u\"I am so happy that Nargis opened a second location. We went on a Friday night and got the achichuk, the cheburek, and the plov.  Protip: save the achichuk to eat on top of the plov. The salad was fresh, the chebureki were crispy and meaty (and came with delicious sauce) and the plov I am still thinking about almost a week later. It's sososososo good. The staff was also delightful and the decor was beautiful. So happy this place is in Park Slope. What a wonderful addition.\", u'My girlfriend and I were seated in the back garden w the waterfall. My girlfriend has a severe gluten allergy (celiac) and our waiter, Simon, was extremely knowledgeable. We ordered the assorted mixed spreads and salads platter and it was absolutely amazing. Gluten free dairy free and soy free. The drinks were amazing, too! Highly recommended.'], u'9.Sweet Brooklyn Bar And Grill': [u\"I don't even live around this bar but this is a bar I will continue to come back to! Came here on a friend's recommendation on a Tuesday for the incredible open mic night and was so entertained. \\n\\nBarbara behind the bar slings drinks like a pro and is so attentive and fresh. Truly a wonderful bartender. Did I mention if you stay late enough you get to hear her incredible vocals on the mic? It's worth it to stay!\\n\\nThe drinks are priced well and while I haven't tried the food yet, it looks and smells delicious. What I love more than anything is the energy this bar has. Everyone there, guests included are in a good mood and they are just ready to enjoy themselves. \\n\\nLooking forward to coming back next Tuesday!\", u'We live  in Brooklyn and We always try to support local joints. My husband and I visited sweet Brooklyn for our weekly date night this week and it was \"meh\"\\n\\nI originally read about the local spot in an article highlighting local joints with great food. We chose Wednesday since it was karaoke night and we were in the mood for some good food and lively entertainment.  We really can\\'t tell you about the entertainment part because we left before it started due to everything else that went wrong.\\n\\nUpon entry, the glass door was full of scuff marks and fingerprints. I turned to leave but my husband said\"let\\'s give it a try, don\\'t be too quick to judge\" so we went in.  We went in, sat at the bar and waited about 10 minutes without being acknowledged. Funny thing is, one of the two bartenders on duty was standing in front of us scrolling away on her phone.  Again, I wanted to leave but my husband again said \"no, they might just be running behind, let\\'s give them time\". After our wait, two glasses of water were set down in front of us along with letter size paper menus.  My husband\\' menu was nice and clean, mine on the other hand had black ink through half the items on the menu( I guess that was there way of telling us those items were not available) \\n\\nWe ordered the grilled chicken tacos and the jerk black bean sliders. The wait after we ordered was a solid 22 minutes  and there were no other order popping out of kitchen as most of the patrons were drinking.  The food was piping hot when it came out , just like I like it ( that\\'s the only thing I liked about the entire evening)  the grilled chicken tacos were ok( just ok. A little seasoning even salt and pepper would have made it better). The jerk black bean sliders were terrible. They were bland, falling apart, missing key components of a slider(mayo and tomatoes) and just not appetizing. The French fries were so salty, they were inedible. \\n\\nOverall, the date night was a flop. We paid our bill and walked half a block down on Nostrand Ave, picked up Chinese food and went home', u\"I came here for brunch last week.  I have been wanting to try it for a while ever since seeing it on a list of black owned restaurants.  It's a really cute spot.  Love the decor.  It's a small space, but doesn't feel too crowded.  The waitstaff was pretty friendly and my overall experience was good.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I didn't love the food.  I ordered the chicken and waffles.  The waffle was really good, but the chicken was pretty dry.  I had to douse it in hot sauce and syrup to borderline enjoy it.  I will say friend had the burger and she said it was good.  I didn't try it, so can't vouch.\\n\\nThey serve unlimited mimosas, which are primarily juice.  But they keep coming, so there's that.  The price of unlimited brunch is different than what's on their website ($28 on the website, $30 in person) and, contrary to what's on the menu, they charge $2 extra if you want bellinis instead of mimosas.  Not exorbitant, but annoying.  You may have noticed from my previous reviews that inconsistent pricing is a pet peeve of mine.\", u'I have to say that I really like the VIBE of this place... It gives me that cool bar vibe with a hint of that Love Jones groove... hahahahaha...\\n\\nBeautiful people brunching with a DJ spinning in the background playing some real good tunes..\\n\\nWe opted for the 28 dollar brunch option which includes unlimited mimosas or bellini and an entree... not bad!\\n\\nThe Food for me was 3 stars... my friend was not crazy about the waffles but enjoyed the fried chicken..\\n\\nAnd for me... I thought the fried chicken was good... I would have preferred more seasoning in the batter.\\n\\nHowever... the food is worth another try... I will go for the catfish and grits next time... and ofcourse unlimited Champaign..', u\"Dope in every way.\\n\\nI came here on a Saturday night and honestly had a blast. I got there fairly early  (around 10ish) so people were still sitting and eating. I decided to eat with my friends as well so we ordered the following:\\nBK Beef Sliders: amazing\\nSweet BK Fries: amazing\\nSweet BK Wings (Asian Chile): amazing\\n\\nIf you didn't catch the drift everything was amazing! I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was! I definitely will be returning here to eat again. For drinks I had a rum punch and that was awesome as well. Overall the food is definitely solid. \\n\\nAround 11:30ish this place turned the hell up. The live DJ was on the money playing great music and all of a sudden this place turned into a dance party. We ended up staying till 4am dancing the night away basically shutting this place down. If you are in the Crown Heights area looking for food and music on a Saturday this is the place to be. I used to hang out in Crown Heights on a regular basis when I was in High School  (15 yrs ago) and this area is COMPLETELY different now. I am happy that places like this are still keeping a piece of the culture in regards to food and music and not gentrifying to the point of being unwelcoming. Bravo for Sweet Brooklyn!\", u'So it\\'s LIT in here, just the way it should be for a weekend brunch. The DJ is spinning those sweet cuts, the mimosas are flowing and the food is FIRE!!!\\n\\nSometime ago the Boo and I made an attempt to come here for dinner but it was much too much of a party for a quiet dinner. HOWEVER, if you want good music, great drinks, and phenomenal food - Sweet Brooklyn Bar & Grill is the place to be. \\n\\nI had the French toast and turkey bacon. I ROLLED my eyes SO HARD when I took that first bite of my French toast - I would say it\\'s the best that I\\'ve had.....and I\\'ve had my share. The turkey bacon was that good incited turkey bacon. I was originally torn between this, the chicken and waffles - and then the catfish and grits when it came out for my neighbor. I\\'m happy with my dish but will definitely try the others when I return. \\n\\nBTW, they sale REAL catfish, not that cheap a$$ Asian fish Basa, masquerading as catfish. This doesn\\'t seem to be an issue for many NYers I\\'ve spoken with and I think it\\'s because they have had Basa masquerading as \"catfish\" for so long they have no idea what real catfish tastes like. I\\'m from Chicago where we eat the hell out of some catfish!! They are truly winning in my book if only because they sale real catfish. Five kisses from me for food, service, drinks, and music!!!', u\"My friends and I had a great brunch here. The food was great and the unlimited bellinis/mimosas were strong. The waitress kept coming by to refill our glasses. I ordered fried catfish and grits, and it was delicious. The grits were flavorful, and the catfish was well-seasoned. My boyfriend and his friend got burgers and fries, and they were also great. I truly enjoyed coming to this place, and will be back for Sunday brunch. \\n\\nI recommend coming early for brunch when the place isn't packed. We were there from 2-3 pm. The place is pretty small.\", u\"Came here for what was supposed to be a mini group for brunch, but a few people cancelled last minute-- don't you just hate that? Anyhow, the show must go on and we still have the place a shot.\\n\\nWe arrived around 1, or shortly thereafter. The place wasn't crowded whatsoever. We were immediately greeted and seated. Gentleman brought over the menu in less than two minutes. She was ready to take our order almost immediately, but we requested a few minutes. I opted for the French toast with the mimosas ($28). I also ordered the white cheddar grits, I believe that was an extra $4 bucks. The French toast was good, but the grits were great. Our cups rarely went empty for too long-- as both the gentleman, the server, and another server there would refill our cups pretty frequently. As the 90 minute for bottomless was coming to an end, the crowd began to pick up in a major way. I would definitely suggest coming earlier because by 3PM-- there seemed to a wait for a seat. \\n\\nThere were two negatives:\\n\\n1)there seemed to be something wrong with the sound system. It started off low then the music would blast for a few seconds then go out again.\\n2)the bathroom wasn't exactly tidy\\n\\nOverall, it was a nice place with good food, good service and fair prices. I would recommend more couples and not larger groups because it's compact here.\", u'Came here for Sunday brunch and it was a blast. The space is small, mostly conducive to standing room perfect for an evening bar set up but the Sunday brunch was just as nice given many people were dancing in between bites. It almost felt like a day party with good food minus the long line to get in. There was a dj that played a slew of reggae and top 40 mashed up hits. The music paired nicely with my rum punch although the mimosas and bellini seem to be the popular drink. \\n\\nThe food was amazingly awesome, flavorful and a hefty portion. The bourbon French toast was sweet and the bread was battered and cooked perfectly. I hate soggy French toast ick. \\n\\nThe only improvement would be the service, it was slightly off. No one greets you when you walk in the door and my server pretty much wanted to kick me off my bar stool since there were other patrons waiting to sit. I would recommend this for small groups of friends hanging out, larger groups should make a reservation.', u\"Visited for Saturday brunch. Good food and good vibes! We order the unlimited Bellinis and our glasses were always full. I had the catfish and grits which was very flavorful and filling. The DJ was cool and the staff was very attentive. I'll be back for sure.\", u\"Maybe because I came in right when they opened, but everything felt discombobulated? I was given the wrong menu at first then was told it's happy hour and given a much, much smaller menu with only 3 food items. I ordered tacos + fries and a drink. The drinks were good and strong. The tacos were tasty too. My fries were apparently locked in the basement freezer and they couldn't get to them so they threw in an extra taco for me for the inconvenience (which I thought was the wait). They spent a majority of the time I was there trying to open the basement to get to the freezer. After sitting there for 40 or so minutes I asked about my fries to find out the order had been voided and that's why I got an extra taco. This wasn't explained to me annnnd to be honest I wanted the fries more than the tacos. Long story short, the confusion that day wasn't really worth it but the food was alright with decent drinks. Not sure if I'll be back unless it's for brunch one day.\", u'This place is bomb.com, I came here two mornings a Saturday & a Sunday for the bottomless brunch hunty .The first day I got the shrimp and grits and my friend got the catfish and grits, both were delicious! The grits are so cheesy & they have homemade biscuits which are good too. The mimosas are okay but I preferred the Bellinis better, you can get either or with the bottomless brunch. Sunday I got grits, turkey bacon, and eggs &my friend got the omelette wth home fries - which are very good, well seasoned. The service is fast and friendly. No honest complaints I would come back.', u\"We came here for brunch and I was pleased!!!   The unlimited brunch drinks (don't judge me) where delicious and flowing! The spot is a cute size (not small and not big) but i was comfortable with my group of 4.  The service was pleasant and quick so quick we got our food b4 the people who were already seated...yipesss!!   But I will say mgmt seem to handle that issue quickly and quietly. \\n\\nI order the Brunch Burger and I was not disappointed.  It was a good size and it was cooked exactly how I like it...perfect medium (pinky and juicy) hmm hmm good.  But that candy bacon was everything.  Now I will request my egg to be lightly fried so the yolk can ooozzzzeee down!!!  Phatt girl was sooooo happy with my meal.  \\n\\nMy only complaint was turn the a/c way up lol and the music was slightly a lil too loud for Sunday brunch or cuz of my slight hangover lol.. but the music was good.\\n\\nI will be back!!!\", u'This is going to be my new after work spot. This bar is very new, a couple months and I came here to celebrate the birthday of a friend after work on a Friday. \\n\\nI was delighted to hear some of my favorite Caribbean ole school tunes as I waked it. The bar was filled with patrons but it was still space to walk around. We waited for a table for a few minutes and ordered wings, burgers, fries and tacos. \\n\\nBar food is pretty standard so I was expecting the regular. \\n\\nI recant this statement as Sweet Brooklyn quickly made me realize that they are in a league of their own and will soon be a force to be reckon with. \\n\\nThe food was way, way, way above any expectation I had. The ingredients were fresh, tasty and the presentation mirrored that of any top restaurants in the city. I was impressed but also happy that this level of culinary skills could be right here on Nostrand avenue. \\n\\nCongratulations and I wish you all the best. I have already told all my friends about it and this will be my new bar to unwind after work.', u\"The food is great!  The price is pretty reasonable.  The space is comfortable.  I went with a party of 5 for brunch on a Saturday which is the slower brunch day (or so I was told by the bartender the previous tuesday night, don't judge my life!)  I had a friend in town last minute so I thought this would be a good spot try earlier on a Saturday, as my friend had to leave town at 3pm.  The shrimp and grits is as good as it gets and it's filling.  Also, $28 gets you a brunch entree and also your bottomless brunch choice.  I personally, prefer the bellinis over the mimosas although the syrup was a little powerful on one or two of the many glasses I had.  The waitstaff keeps the drinks flowing so there's no complaints there.  I heard good reviews about the French Toast and the the Chicken and waffle as well.  During the week, this is a nice bar to pop into.  Check out Game Nights on Tuesdays.\", u'Chicken and waffles was great and chicken was amazing i come here breakest again prices was ok', u'Sunday Brunch was delicious. It took a while to get a seat, but once our meal came - it was all well in the world. And the food was phenomenal. $28 for bottom', u\"This is definitely a bar, not a restaurant. And I don't know why when reading the reviews I thought it would be otherwise. Fortunately for us (probably less so for the establishment) there was no wait for our small party late on a Saturday night since it was rather empty. In fact, they had actually extended happy hour for an additional two hours. Sweeet.\\n\\nFood was good. Not cheap at all (so are Brooklyn prices exactly the same Manhattan now? #nothanks) My lamb sliders with blue cheese dressing were pretty effing on point. The four cheese mac n' cheese was talked up in reviews, but I was not blown away. It's so intensely cheesy. And perhaps the blend of cheeses used didn't hit the spot for me. There were nice crispy parts of baked penne, but the cheese soaked interior parts were just rather oily. And when I reheated a couple spoonfuls of leftover mac two days later, the pool of oil at the bottom of my bowl left me so not proud of my food choices...\\nYerp.\\n\\nAs a local bar with delicious food options spot, this would be excellent. They have various events during the evenings, such as karaoke Wednesdays that made me wish so badly this was my hood! On weekend nights like Saturday, a live DJ comes starting at 10pm. Good luck trying to have an audible conversation after that point, but my man's music was pretty on point (props to Brooklyn there).\\n\\nAll in all, a worthwhile stop-in if you're nearby, and I hope they do well in their niche, but it's nothing to trek in for if you reside in another boro like moi. For neighborhood vibes spot though, that's fine  as is.\", u'Excellent bar tenders that actually treat you as a guest or a patient.  Rare these days.  Most bartenders (majority) have the DMV mentality where they know you need then more than the other way around.\\n\\nThis is my 7th time returning.', u'I was excited to see a really cool place in the neighborhood where I can chill, get a bite to eat and vibe with some cool people until I actually walked into this spot. My sister, my cousin visiting from out of town and I walked in and walked out in 20 minutes. Very poor service not a single person was available to take a drink order, let alone food. So disappointing, you want to support our Black Owned Businesses, however this one really needs to step up or step out of the business. Will never come back, and will never recommend going...'], u'8.My Cuban Spot': [u\"Let me start by saying that this place literally hit the spot. \\n\\nThe minute you walk up to their window you meet Luis, who is the proud owner and dope as hell. He spoke to all his customers which I even noticed he has a lot of regulars because he knew a lot of them by name. Soon to know my name, because I will begin to become a regular. \\n\\nChecking out the menu there are so many delicious options that you don't know what to chose from. We decided to choose almost all of them! \\n\\nWe stuffed our faces with:\\n-Pork Crack-Lins\\n-Cuban Bread & Buttah\\n-This Little Piggy Needs Bread \\n-The Boss Sandwich\\n-Pick-A-Dillow Bowl \\n-I'm BROKE Bitch\\n\\nAnd to drink! \\n-Cortadito\\n-Cafe con Leche\\n\\nBecause dessert is always needed we had tres leche! (A MUST) \\n\\nI give every dish a five star. If you want amazing cuban food take the time and head over!\", u\"What a good Cuban sandwich I had! One of the best the city has to offer. In kind of a desolate part of Brooklyn, but definitely worth the trip. Also tried\\nThe chicken rice and beans bowl which was good, but nothing new.\\nGo there and get the Cuban it's worth the trip.\", u'\"Best cuban Sandwich I\\'ve ever had\" - a real Cuban \\n\"I\\'m sad Bc once I began eating the second half, I knew it was almost over\" - same cuban\\n\\nA one off hole on the wall with major taste!', u\"The food is absolutely amazing. Coming from a Cuban who lives in Miami I can honestly say it doesn't get any more authentic than this place. Every bite was like if my own Cuban grandmother was in the kitchen with them. To top it off.... C U B A N COFFEE. They take their time and make all of the food with love. \\n\\nI honestly wish I could taste the entire menu. I recommend this to anyone and everyone looking for authentic mouth watering (Cuban) food.\", u'So my husband has been raving about this spot, literally driving me crazy about how delicious the Cuban sandwich is, finally I decided to have one, even though I am not a huge fan of them, I\\'ve had cuban sandwiches in Miami, cuban places in New York & New Jersey, they were always just okay, basically you order it once, and never again. Well today I must admit that I had the most delicious Cuban sandwich I ever had!!!! The pork was so flavorful! The pickles (which I hate pickles) were cut so thin, but gave the sandwich an extra little crunch, without being over powering, the bread was perfect! Especially with the butter on top! The sandwich came with plantain chips, and a garlic sauce, and who doesn\\'t love anything with garlic? I also had the beef empanadas, good, but with that Cuban sandwich in front of me, I kind of neglected the empanada. It\\'s a nice portion sandwich also, very filling, very delicious!!! I will no longer say \"I don\\'t care for Cuban sandwiches\" but will say if you want a Cuban sandwich, come here!!!! \\n\\nPeter if you\\'re reading this....next yelp event spot, before the weather gets cold.', u\"Waited 15 minutes in line (only 2 people ahead of me)Ordered rice bowl and then I'm told that will take an additional 25 minutes. That makes no sense. I wanted this to be a good experience but it's not. 40 minutes for take out is really ridiculous.\", u\"As I approached this newly opened spot around 12:30pm for lunch on a Sunday, I noticed a big crows of people waiting for their food. Good sign I figured. However, while the food is very good, this line is also describing the wait. Only two people can fit in the tiny shack of a restaurant, so understandably they can only do so much. My wait time was around 20-25 minutes. Which isn't awful, but when you're standing outside with now where to sit because the few seats available are taken, this can feel like an eternity. I would recommend coming for the delicious Cubano or Pork sandwich, but only when there is not much of a line/crowd.\", u\"Wow! Unbelievable! The little piggy was really tasty and the beef empanada was delicious. The only thing I would tell people is that it's not fast food and you're going to wait at least 10 to 15 minutes. But it's worth the wait.\", u'The way they treat *certain* customers is DISGUSTING. I will NEVER darken their doorstep again.\\n\\nI called to place an order for pick up at 1:08. They told me it would be 20 minutes. No problem. I leave the office at 1:30 and take the 4 minute walk over. \\n\\nAt 1:50 I still hadn\\'t been ACKNOWLEDGED as a human being waiting a their counter, even though I watched that nasty chick and the dude either acknowledge or service other customers. When I said to the chick, \"I\\'ve been standing here, waiting to be acknowledged,\" the FIRST thing out of her mouth was, \"We\\'re not Shake Shack!\"\\n\\nHuh? What? What the hell does Shake Shack have to do with treating people like they EXIST?\\n\\nWhen I ask her why she is bringing up Shake Shack she claims she wasn\\'t talking to me or about me. What am I, stupid? So then why are you making direct eye contact and addressing ME?\\n\\nThen she says, \"Give me a freaking minute, you see I\\'m making sandwiches.\"\\n\\nWOW! \\n\\nShe was right - My Cuban Spot is NOT Shake Shack. \\n\\nAt Shake Shack they treat their customers like human beings who deserve a little bit of kindness, respect and dignity. \\n\\nAt Shake Shack not only do they serve quality food, but they do so at a reasonable pace - they don\\'t have you waiting for 50 minutes for ONE order (a rice bowl). \\n\\nAt Shake Shack, they would never dream of lashing out at the customer for what is actually the restaurant\\'s own mistake. \\n\\nThat chick has a rotten attitude and I will NEVER patronize this restaurant ever again. You lost a customer for life.\\n\\nIt\\'s now 2:08 and still haven\\'t eaten. Thank you for completely ruining my lunch hour.', u\"OMG!!  The absolute best Cuban sandwich I have ever had in my LIFE!!  \\n\\nAnd I am not even exaggerating.  The flavors that they packed into this sandwich are amazing! The maduros are cooked perfectly! Worth every single penny.  And they serve you with a smile!\\n\\nI'll be back there very soon!\", u'Wepppppaaaaa!  I finally found Authentic Cuban cuisine in New York.  As a Cubana from Miami this means everything to me.  The Boss Sandwich (El Cubano) is better than any other Cuban sandwich I have ever tried.  The flan was better than abuelitas, sorry Grandma. For a tiny spot they they sure do pack a big punch. Get here fast!', u'Most impressive part of this spot is the owner cooking you and serving you the meal. On top of that, the beef empanadas and Cuban sandwich were insane. \\n\\nThe Cuban was succulent, flavorful and cooked perfectly. If you are looking for Jesus, he is hiding in Gowanus inside of a Cuban sandwich. I found him on my third bite. \\n\\nPs..... Cafe bustelo all day!', u\"Best Cuban Sandwich ever! The empanadas, croquette and chicharron are all spot on. The 'oink oink babe' bowl was amazing and the picadillo bowl are both must try!Authentic Miami style Cuban food has just hit New York for the first time. They even carry Cuban sodas like Materva, Jupi\\xf1a and Ironbeer. Oh and the Pan Con Bistec made us start spontaneous salsa dancing!\", u\"Seriously no joke spot. My gf started with a beef empanada and said it was awesome. We each got a bowl with rice and beans, fish and Maduro's and it was all superb. Yuca fries were outstanding as well.\", u\"My new obsession! My one complaint is that it's not across the street so I can grab a coffee every morning! Love love love! We ordered the Cuban sandwich and the pulled pork mojo bowl...both were mouth watering heaven in your mouth! Owners were ridiculously sweet and the food was true authentic Cuban food! Being from south Florida I crave Cuban coffee and food all the time, so this was a true gem!\", u\"They had me waiting at the window for 15 minutes and they were just joking and laughing with each other and noticed me several times and said nothing about being closed.  They knew I was waiting to order and it was only 8 pm on a Saturday night.  It looked open, people were eating outside, and yelp says they close at 9, but they acted like they've never had customers before and like they don't know what I could possibly be doing standing there as I waited to order.  \\n\\nThe menu does a hard attempt at sounding hip, but they just sound cheesy.  This is yet another overpriced and inauthentic Cuban option in New York.  They are a dime a dozen.  This one has a little bit better prices than most, but you can tell it's going to be inauthentic and disappointing by the non Cubans working there and the menu that attempts to add personality to each menu item in a way that only overprivileged hipsters and yuppies could find funny.  These types of places are always run by hipsters, never real Cubans because they can't afford to live in the socialist wasteland of NYC where you have to pay outrages amounts for rent that no honest working class person could afford.  The cost of NYC keeps it so only hipsters can run the Cuban restaurants around here and the real Cubans of Miami, who give you the most delicious $3-$5 Cuban sandwiches you could ever taste, could never afford such outrageous prices, so we end up stuck with the hipster version of everything rather than the authentic ones made by people who have been doing it for generations.  \\n\\nI don't get why they close so early on a weekend.  The worst part is they had all the lights on and everything looked open and they could tell that I was waiting to order and they kept ignoring me almost like I'm supposed to have the clairvoyance to know when they close and that they actually close ridiculously early for a weekend night in gowanus.  It was just a minute after 8 anyway and they could've made me a quick sandwich for waiting for so long. I made it obvious I was standing waiting to order and they noticed me several times and just chose to ignore me.\", u'Amazing to have cuban food like this outside Cuba. Would definitely come back. Best cuban sandwich I ever had outside Havana.', u\"This place is the real deal. Excellent service and food, made by an extremely friendly Miami transplant. If you're looking for authentic Cuban, this is it. Don't miss the empanadas and Cuban coffee!\", u\"I literally cannot say enough good things about this new spot! I am part Cuban  and my husband is Puerto Rican and we both can't believe how delicious the food is and how reasonably priced is.  We are big foodies and are actually quite picky (probably only 1 out of 5 times do we really like a new restaurant we go to). Me, my husband and our two teenage daughters went nuts for everything we ordered. The quality is insane (there was not a piece of cartilage or fat or unwanted anything) it was just perfect and delicious and seasoned absolutely beautifully. Anytime we want Spanish food this will be our spot from now on!!! \\n\\nBig portions, inexpensive and they even use biodegradable cartons. Just perfection.\", u'Ummm.... amazingly delish! Had the Cuban sandwich and the beef empanada. Both so flavorful, fresh and juicy. The only issue is I wish I ordered more than 2 empanadas. I should have ordered ALL the empanadas!!  Super friendly and personable people there. Definitely going to try more.'], u'187.Baba\\u2019s Pierogies': [u'This place seriously rocks.  I don\\'t know why the category is polish, the owner (and her baba) are slovak.  Which is great because the czech beer they stock is probably better than polish beer.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t just your basic \"boiled vs. fried\" pierogi place.  There\\'s a lot of choice of fillings including some americanized versions like mac & cheese pierogis (seriously awesome), jalapeno/cheese/potato pierogi, you have add on options like mushrooms and bacon and in addition to the sour cream dip you also can get things like horseradish dip.\\n\\nEverything is made perfectly, and the attention to detail the owner put into the design of the restaurant by using reclaimed maple bowling alley floors for the bar counter and table tops is just one example of many that makes Baba\\'s a stellar place to grab a bite.', u\"Simply wonderful. I had an order of five fried jalape\\xf1o and cheese, and they were exquisite. I was so inspired that I also got an extra dip (you get sour cream with 'em), called Helen's dip, which was perfectly spicy -- not too hot, just right. \\n\\nI'd read lots of good reviews about Baba's, but am always doubtful whether the experience will live up to the hype. This place does it. I loved my savory ones so much, that I ordered dessert pierogies. It's a good thing this place is a bus ride away, or else I'd be in trouble. Yeah, they're THAT good.\", u\"It has been a long time since I've had pierogies. My grandfather would make them when I was a child and I recall sitting on the floor of their living room with a plate of cheesy potato pierogies, caramelized onion and sour cream. I could barely control myself and often burned my mouth on the first bites. \\n\\nFlash forward 25 years to a Saturday afternoon spent in Gowanus. I had actually just heard of Baba's Pierogies though a news segment on NY1 (yes, I watch local news and yes, I love it). I was going to be in the neighborhood for a friend's birthday which consisted of barhopping using the Brooklyn immersion as a guide.  The second I saw Baba's on the list, I  mentally prepared myself to eat them. I did not care what it took. So after not eating BBQ and a few other tasty treats, I dragged a group of friends from the group and arrived at Baba's small, busy store. Service was quick and very friendly. We placed our orders to go and patiently waited out front. I *had* to get a large order of cheese and bacon, fried. Unfortunately, I was splitting it and could not consume them all myself. They were delicious! I wish I had a full 2nd order (although it would not help my waistline). I cannot wait to return to try a few more pierogies once fall comes around. I always associate these delicious pockets of potato and cheese with cooler months. I urge anyone to give these delicious morsels a try. You won't be disappointed!\", u\"After my supreme disappointment with the Pierogi Boys at the DeKalb Market, I've been on the hunt for some good pierogies; and I'm happy to say the Baba's definitely delivers. Pierogies are one of those foods that become dangerously addictive, to the point where I'm thankful I live a solid 40 minutes from Baba's, otherwise I'd probably be back there right now to have another 15 or so, while I mull over this review. \\n\\nI went with the potato and cheese (boiled,) bacon and cheese (fried,) and the mac and cheese (fried.) Surprisingly, the only disappointing one was the mac and cheese pierogi. It wasn't particularly bad, it was just very bland. However, with a side of horseradish sauce, I still happily inhaled all of them. Both the potato and cheese, and the bacon and cheese were very good.\\n\\nA little tip, as a fat bastard, when given the option between something cooked in water, or something cooked in fat, I'm always going to choose the latter. However, when it comes to pierogies, don't overlook the boiled ones. When you pan-fry the pierogies it totally changes the texture of the pierogi, and the soft, delicate dough is lost. My favorite pierogi of the day was the boiled, potato and cheese. And for me to choose that over one with bacon is almost sacrilege. So give the boiled a shot, you won't be disappointed.\", u\"I used to eat pierogies all the time as a kid and I would crave them from time to time but had no idea where to get my hands on them. Luckily I came across babas as I was walking to work one day.\\n\\nI ordered the potatoe and cheese pierogies boiled with butter and mushrooms on top. They were sooo good! They were so soft and buttery and the flavor of the mushroom topics was a surprisingly great pair. \\n\\nNot only is the food great, the customer service was more than I could have asked for.\\nI work close to the restaurant but was unable to leave my desk. I called on a day that they don't deliver and once I told the woman who answered the phone that I couldn't leave my desk she hand delivered them herself without me asking. She was too kind! This was a perfect summer lunch and couldn't have been delivered any better.\", u\"Be still my heart\\n\\nNo seriously, this place is that good, the combination of grandma's dumpling recipe and a friendly staff make this place truly amazing. Walking into the tiny storefront, you'd be forgiven for thinking that this was just an ordinary eatery. I mean, pierogies only, sure that is super nich (borderline hipster), but hey it's Brooklyn after all. Things get a little more interesting when you take a gander at the menu however, with interesting combos like mac and cheese and jalapeno pierogies. You also have your choice of boiled or pan fried, but lets be honest, you're about to consume what essentially amounts to a dough pocket filled with potato and cheese, do you really think that boiling them as opposed to having them fried is going to save your cholesterol levels?  You only live once, so C'est la vie; do the right thing and order the potato and cheese and add in bacon and get them fried. once you've eaten a few of these, tell me they aren't the finest you've ever (no seriously, tell me where I can find any better than this in the states and I'll be on my way to try them out). \\n\\n\\nDrop what you're doing and head to Baba's as fast as you can get there, I promise you won't be disappointed.\", u\"TIL pierogies and piroshkies are not the same things. Don't worry, I found out before I got here, so I was mentally prepared. \\n\\nMy friends and I appreciated the simple decor and the brightly lit dining area. Seating was comfortable, and didn't feel too tight, even though it is a small space. However, I wouldn't plan on bringing large groups unless you are planning on renting the entire space.\\n\\nTheir menu is simple. There are a variety of pierogies with the option to order them fried or boiled. You also have the option of adding on toppings or additional sauces, which is a nice way to be able to customize your meal to your liking. For each type of pierogies, you have the option of ordering 5 or 9, priced accordingly. \\n\\nIn addition to pierogies, they also have an assortment of sandwiches and salads. If you don't know what to order, definitely ask for recommendations! We enjoyed everything we ordered: boiled sauerkraut pierogies with saut\\xe9ed mushroom, fried mac and cheese pierogies, jalape\\xf1o pierogies, and the 8 piece schnitzels. \\n\\nMy favorite was the schnitzels - they are deep fried to perfection and served with a delicious macaroni salad. The pierogies were okay by me, with my favorite being the mac and cheese ones. I also loved the saut\\xe9ed mushrooms and could have definitely had just that by itself. My friends were fans of everything but the jalape\\xf1o - which they claimed had an odd texture. I didn't find it so bad, as it was pretty much mashed potato in a pierogi.\\n\\nService was friendly and the ordering/payment was extremely streamlined via iPad app!\", u\"Finally made it here! Love the simplicity and the comfort of this place! By far my favorite - potato and cheese boiled pierogies with bacon bits (omg! those bits!).  Definitely a deliciously filling treat.  Wasn't terribly crazy about the mac-n-cheese fried pierogies - kinda got my taste buds all confused but my friend definitely enjoyed these (will also skip the salad next time - haha)  Love a place that reminds me of grandma's cooking! Thank you!\", u'Friendly family owned spot! Pierogies were super good! We got the spinach ones boiled and mac n cheese ones pan fried! We preferred the spinach ones! Love that they specialize in pierogies! We want to try the other flavors!', u'I don\\'t do a lot of \"exercise,\" so after biking down a hill for about six to seven minutes, I felt as though I\\'d earned some pierogies. (I know we just ate lunch, but coasting slowly is quite taxing.)\\n\\nWell, Baba\\'s has pierogies, and they are the finest pierogies you\\'ll ever eat. They are handmade to order in this adorable little shop with pictures on the wall of Polish grandmothers perfecting the recipe years ago.\\n\\nThe pierogies come in orders of five or nine, with the larger size only costing a couple dollars more, so you really have to get more pierogies unless you\\'re an idiot. \\n\\nSome people say \"go big or go home.\" \\nI say, \"Go big and then go home and eat all the pierogies.\"\\n\\nI went with the bacon and cheese variety. Pan fried, because nothing is better boiled. And I know these delightful little bombs of flavor served with sour cream are pierogies because the big sign outside says they are, but I\\'m going to call them what they are: \\n\\nLoaded baked potato dumplings. \\n\\nAnd they are the best.', u\"Mac. N. Cheese. Pierogies. Does life get any better than this? Doubt it.\\n\\nThese definitely aren't your grandmother's pierogies, although they have plenty of traditional flavors if you want to go that route. Prices are a little bit higher than what you might find in Greenpoint, but just as delicious and 10x more creative.\\n\\nLike, mac n cheese pierogies. How have I lived so long without tasting these? Get them pan fried; the thin (not doughy) skin allowed them to fry up super crispy, which blended perfectly with the creamy mac n cheese on the inside. They're also pretty sizable; I split an order of 9 with a friend for a snack, and we were both completely satisfied.\\n\\nI definitely need to come and try more of their innovative offerings, like their spinach and feta or dessert (!!!) pierogies. We did try the beet salad too, and while it was light and refreshing, I probably wouldn't order it again. Save room for more dumplings.\\n\\nThe staff were also super friendly and helpful, so don't be afraid to ask for suggestions! I'm definitely heading back to Baba's soon.\", u\"I'm maybe a little obsessed with this place. I first got a sampling of their pan fried smoked bacon and cheddar pierogies at Brooklyn Uncorked 2017 - so soft and savory and doughy with a dollop of sour cream that perfectly complemented the flavors of the bacon and cheddar, and I knew I was a goner. So, a week later, I made a trip to this place and boy was it worth every minute.\\n\\nFirst off, shout-out to the waiter whose name I didn't catch but who was working last night - you are the real MVP. So attentive but not overbearing, apologetic for reasons that still escape me (you were so great! we didn't feel like we were kept waiting at all!), and handling the dinner rush like a PRO.\\n\\nWe got 5 of the jalapeno and 5 of the smoked bacon pierogies - for value, 9 is probably the better deal but if you want to mix and match your pierogies, get 5. I personally really liked the pan fried ones and they come with sour cream, but if you're feeling like you want some variety, the steamed ones are probably lit as well.\\n\\nNow, there's plenty on the menu that isn't pierogies - there's sandwiches and salads and oh my GOSH, schnitzel bites. Don't even talk to me about schnitzel bites unless you can make them as good as this place does. The outer layer is almost crunchy and the meat inside is so well-seasoned and balanced, flavor-wise. One order comes with 8, and I tell ya, you really can't go wrong with these. I also got the Jasminade, which was very lightly sweetened so that the jasmine flowers really permeate the lemonade and give it a nice floral kick. \\n\\nThe space is a wee bit on the small side but it's cozy and well-lit for your inevitable Instagrams. They also do takeout!\", u\"Great place to eat pierogis. These are delicious and authentic (being Polish native I can say that). We've had boiled Feta & Spinach and pan fried Sourkraut. Both were delicious, dough was very light, and pierogis were shaped expertly. We liked the fact that there was a lot of filling inside, these are handmade, because there would be nothing worse than pierogis with more dough than filling. For the dessert we had blueberry pierogis which are absolute must! Butter/honey glaze and sweet whipped cream was on point. We would recommend this place.\", u\"Amazing! Such a cute spot. Lovely design. Super fresh perogies and our server Nick couldn't have been nicer or more attentive. Can't wait to go back!\", u\"I came here for dinner on a Sunday.  The place is on 3rd Avenue so there's not much foot traffic.  The place seemed cute and there's a lot of seating if you want to dine in.  I wanted to do take out.  They cook them to order so it took about 5-10 min. I ordered a large order of boiled spinach and feta pierogies.  You can order regular (5 pierogies) or large (9 pierogies).  Also, you can order the pierogies fried or boiled.  It was still warm when I opened it at home.  I really appreciated the fresh chives they sprinkled on top.  The pierogies were delicious and very filling.  I would come back and try their other flavors.\", u\"A true GEM! Being here brought me back to those days in Kazakhstan when my mom would make pierogies on a Sunday afternoon and we would eat, watch TV and just enjoy each other's company. And if the food was not enough, the service here is Impeccable!!! Will be coming back!!\", u\"I was born in Ukraine and so grew up eating pierogies. When I heard about this place I got pretty excited and decided to go check it out with my parents and I was not disappointed. The staff is super friendly and this is very clearly a labor of love. The restaurant is small but bright and open. We tried the sauerkraut boiled w/ onions, potato and cheese pan fried w/ onions and the jalapeno boiled topped with bacon bits. We also got kielbasy sliders and then blueberry pierogi for dessert. All of the pierogies were delicious - although your favorite will depend a lot on whether you like them more boiled of fried. We were disappointed in the onions because we usually chop them up into little squares and fry them to a crisp to be a topping - here it seems they were boiled in strands and I'd tell you to pass on them. The Jalapeno pierogi are absolutely inspired - they had a nice kick without being overwhelming and topping them with bacon brought them to a whole new level. The fattiness of the pork and the kick of the peppers worked really well together. I'm glad to see them experimenting with new fillings and pushing the pierogi forward as a dish. If you've never had pierogies or your baba made them every week you should come out here and try some - you'll be glad you did!\", u\"I've passed by the Baba's Pierogies a couple of times and have always admired the decor from outside. I finally had the chance to try out the food and was not disappointed. The pan-fried jalapeno pierogies were my favorite. They had a mini kick to it and it was veryyyy flavorful. The bacon cheddar ones were also good and I tasted bacon in every bite. The Schnitzel bites were better than I expected, they were crispy and so freaking good. \\n\\nJust remember - order at the register first, then find a seat! Once you find a seat, it's table service. The staff was very nice and they answered all the questions we had on the menu.\", u\"What you need to know:  \\n- Baba's is a family run shop, operating on their grandma's recipe and made with tremendous amounts of love.  Whether it's your very first time or you're a regular, they treat you like family! \\n- The pierogis are made to order, so it takes a little while, but you can definitely taste the love. \\n- They accept credit cards, serve a small selection of beer and have an adorable seating area. \\n\\nWhat I ordered:\\n- bacon cheddar (pan fried):  the bacon flavor is amazingly robust! After trying many of their flavors, this is my favorite!  \\n- potato & cheese (boiled) and added a side of saut\\xe9ed mushrooms:  the skin is soft and the filling has bits of course potato, making for amazing texture. Along with bacon cheddar, this is my go-to flavor.\", u\"My friends and I liked Baba's Pierogies so much that we came here twice in one afternoon!\\n\\nOn a Saturday afternoon around 1pm, the restaurant was pretty full. We decided to order three types to try: jalapeno (boiled), spinach & feta (boiled), and mac & cheese (pan fried). All three of them were delicious! The pierogies did take a while to come out of the kitchen, but we could tell they were all freshly made. Later that afternoon when we came back around 3:30pm, it was still (surprisingly) pretty full. This time we ordered potato cheese (boiled), bacon cheddar (pan fried), and mac & cheese (pan fried). We also decided to get some of the homemade applesauce and Helen's dips, which are toppings that you can add for an additional amount. Helen's dip was a blend of sriracha, lime juice, and sour cream, and it added a nice kick to the savory pierogies. \\n\\nThe service here was also wonderful. Our water was always refilled promptly and they apologized repeatedly for the table wait, even though we didn't even mind. One of the guys working there was so incredibly nice - even after we had left the shop and were standing around outside, he came to the door to say thanks for coming. Baba's Pierogies is definitely worth a trip to Gowanus!\"], u'21.Swell Dive': [u\"I took my wife and toddler son here for dinner tonight and it was exceptionally delicious. We had chips and queso, adobo and sig sig and fish tacos simply superb! I had the pain killer which tasted as if I was floating at the soggy dollar in the BVI!\\n\\nThe atmosphere is laid back, the vibe is mellow and the music on the box is old Skool 80's 90's.  \\n\\nThe owner is a super  nice guy and I am proud to be a Filipino tonight! Good job pare!\\n\\nWe coming back....\", u\"Came here for a late afternoon snack and was so excited to finally try the tacos that look great from the photos. Cute place with a nice patio in the back to play board games and just hang out but it was bombarded by giant flies everywhere. That diminished our experience and grossed us out. There were little buckets on the floor in the back filled with cigarettes and it looked like the place wasn't cleaned for a while.\\n\\nThe food was ok. Had an assortment of tacos but nothing to really write home about, which is disappointing. The chips and queso were ok, but the chips were getting on the stale side. Wasn't a fan of the mushy beans in every taco.\", u\"Swell Dive is a really swell place, complete with tasty fare and fun board games in a laid back environment. \\n\\nA couple of friends and I spent much of Saturday afternoon and well into evening here. Starting out with surprisingly good iced coffees and chips with queso, one of my friends and I later moved on to glasses of rose and finally a couple rounds of margaritas, which were accompanied by an order of the wings and the fried cheese tacos. Everything was delicious.\\n\\nIf it sounds like we were here for a long time, we were. A game of Scrabble filled the latter part of our afternoon. We then gave Never Have I Ever a go, until we realized that none of the scenarios were particularly remarkable. We had better stories to tell, anyway.\\n\\nNot once were we pushed to leave by the staff, who were always friendly and patient.\\n\\nI can't wait to go back!\", u\"I've been here a few times and really like their tacos. To be fair, I've only had their smoked pork and grilled fish tacos, but both are delicious. I like how the fish is grilled, not fried, and comes with avocado. And I like how both tacos come with fried onions. It adds a unique flavor and great texture to the taco. Tacos are made fresh to order and delivered hot. If you get tacos to go, you are provided the most-perfect size bag. This place has games and a backyard patio! Plus, bartenders are extremely friendly.\", u\"Where to start but the beginning.  If this place had been one ounce more relaxed I would have been asleep. I've never felt so relaxed ...IN A BAR/RESTAURANT.  But this place is wonderful. And when they tell you their meat is great, believe them. Marinated for 9 hours in some dishes and the flavors so explosive that your inner fat kid, the one you typically shame, is allowed to dance a jig and run free.  Let them and work it out with the treadmill later.\", u\"Sometimes have some customer service things but it's not every employee, just one or two. Otherwise good tacos, yummy homemade chips, drinks are solid, table games... and foosball (spelling?)  in the back. Come here fo sho.\", u'The food was good, big fan of the cauliflower taco. Ambiance is fun. Service needs some work. Overall, would recommend.', u\"This place is just alright. As a place that brands itself as Tex-Mex, I do expect more. For one, the prices are pretty expensive. Each taco costs you about $3.50-$4, but the catch is that they are quite small. I had the potato, egg, and cheese and the queso when I went. The taco was small, cold, and there was no salsa/hot sauce in sight. The queso was flavorful and came out hot, but the chips were incredibly burnt. The folks I came here with also ordered queso, and their chips were also burnt. \\n\\nNot to mention that the man who brought out our tacos couldn't remember who ordered what. We ended up having to keep picking at our tacos and moving them to different plates just to figure out who had what. \\n\\nAll in all, I think I'll stick to making my own breakfast tacos and queso. This place is decent in a pinch, but if you're looking for a satisfying meal, I'd say keep searching.\", u\"I really really love this place and I'm only knocking off a star because I think it's a bit pricey for what it should be. Although, that being said, the food was delicious and everything around us is pricey af so relatively speaking it's really more a non-issue since i like throwing money anywhere I can. But then you know, gotta keep 'em honest.\\n\\nI digress..\\n\\nI came here with friends after the breakfast menu ended so I can only speak on the dinner menu food wise. I LOVED the charred beef tacos. i also equally LOVED the pork sisig nachos. I washed them down with San Miguels and cocktails from a fairly extensive list. Being Filipino myself I can't not get a San Miguel beer at a Filipino restaurant. \\n\\nThis place is super chill. They have a back patio, music bumpin', and games a plenty. The bartenders were friendly and no one is on your ass to order or rush you out. Huge fan. Since I need tacos in my mouth on a regular basis I'm coming back asap.\", u\"I don't get why people like this place so much. The bar is tiny and cramped, though on a Fri night, we were lucky enough to get one of the big booth areas for our party of 8, but when ordering you have to hover right over the people sitting at the bar. The craft tap list is good, but not amazing. Too much mediocre Evil Twin while I was there. \\n\\nBut worse was the food. First of all, my tacos were completely cold, inside and out, so the chicken was definitely dry. It was almost too gross, but I was starving, so I didn't want to send it back. The nachos were forgotten for 30 mins until we reminded them and they were really mediocre. Maybe I'm spoiled in Crown Heights with so many great new Mexican places, but the nachos were room temperature and had dry chicken too (we switched it from the pork), indicating that the chicken they had that night was overcooked. The sauce was only okay, especially considering this is supposed to be fusion with Filipino food. Maybe it's normally better and it was too busy and our food was just dying on the counter for too long. Either way, not worth the expense. Might come back for drinks if someone in the area invites me, but I'd rather go somewhere else with more satisfying food.\", u\"This place is so fucking great. Every taco I've had is delicious. Those handmade tortillas are such a great touch. Also the portions are huge and the quality of ingredients are top notch. \\n\\nFried cheese, sisig, the beef all amazing. The longanisa in the breakfast tacos was super authentic. That queso is so decadent.\\n\\nThe breakfast tacos are an awesome addition to breakfast around here.\\n\\nEveryone there is really really nice and it's got a chill vibe. \\n\\nGood Toby's Estate coffee too. \\n\\nSee ya there.\", u'Nice friendly neighborhood vibe. Delicious food - we had the cheese slab taco and this crazy potato thing that was so yummy and a pork sisig taco that was thumbs waaaay up. \\nHighly recommend.', u\"Really awesome space with lots of seating and cutesy theme decor. \\n\\nKitchen opens at 5...so we came around 4:30 and enjoyed a fresh margarita and some chips & queso. For tacos, we wanted to try the okra but they were out (not sure why this wasn't addressed when we first entered the spot and asked about food) so, being vegetarian, we had to order the slab cheese. They were pretty bland...wouldn't order again. \\n\\nI would highly recommend a classic margarita and the chips & queso (7$). \\n\\nTo be honest, I was a little turned off with the bartender smoking in the garden. I thought it was inconsiderate with several parties eating in the little space.\", u\"One of the best restaurant in Brooklyn. So thankful to my friend who brought me here. We both love tacos. I tried the silogs and they're very tasty. Everything about Swell Dive is lovely.\", u\"I love this place! Good draft beers and delicious tacos (both breakfast and dinner tacos are really tasty). The vibe is really nice here and it's my favorite spot to meet for a quick beer and snack. It does get kind of busy on the weekends, which isn't surprising. Cool backyard area with a foosball table :) Also, the bartenders are really nice.\", u\"I really enjoyed this new spot! Being a long time resident of Bedstuy, and previously living about 2 steps from it. \\n\\nMy friend and I came here for a post Happy Hour meal. Ordered 2 pork tacos, wings, and 2 beef tacos. Everything was good! Like everything. We also grabbed a pitcher of beer to wash it all down and I'm remember it being relatively cheap.\\n\\nIf you're like me and needed more options besides Black Swan and the new Korean spot on Nostrand/Lafayette- you should stop by! \\n\\nService was a plus as well\", u\"Listen. Despite this rating, these were some 5-star effing nachos. I can't even begin to describe how perfectly combined the flavors were in the Swell Nachos. The queso... the sisig... it was the perfect drunk food. However, it's way overpriced, and the chips are too thin to ever have been legit tortillas (you're constantly fighting breaking chips, fingers all messy and cheesy because they didn't give a fork like every other civilized restaurant).\\n\\nThe bad part, though, was the drink. I ordered a vodka soda, and got the lightest pour in the history of light-ass pours. It was a tall glass, full of ice, and I watched who I'm guessing was the owner pour about a half inch of vodka. It was probably a quarter ounce. Like, one-tenth of the glass. She filled the rest with soda.\\n\\nWhat.\\nThe.\\nEff??\\n\\nWon't be back here for drinks, for sure. If you're just hungry, go get those damn nachos.\", u\"I keep thinking about the charred beef and chicken adobo tacos... Oh wow, so delicious. Being from Hawaii, I am used to some good Filipino chicken adobo. This chicken adobo - was even better than what I had in Hawaii and in a perfect soft, flour tortilla.\\n\\nThe charred beef was like taco with soft cubes of marinated beef, super juicy. Yum. \\n\\nWe also tried the spam taco, very delicious.\\n\\nAnd the cheese, also yummy vegetarian option...\\n\\nAnd the smoked pork, also great. \\n\\nAll the tacos are filled with lots of meat/filling, they are not stingy on the filling. Also, they don't double up on the tortilla, which I think a lot of places do, to make you fuller off of less protein. Thanks, guys!\\n\\nOh, I also liked the chips and queso - homemade cheese dip (made with real cheese, I heard). Comes with yummy, spicy green chile salsa. Actually, would be a great kids food (maybe ask for it without the spice for the kids?), but my 3-year-old loved it. I think they make their own corn tortilla chips too. \\n\\nI'm definitely going back. I hope the start to do delivery and to my house in Bed Stuy!\", u\"I've been here twice and have loved everything I've ordered/sampled! Very easy to find a table, reasonably priced, and absolutely delicious food. The menu is small but food typically comes out pretty quickly. It's a new favorite spot of mine!\", u\"Great spot (amazing space for kids & families, games, etc.), outstanding food and super friendly staff.  Outdoor space in the back is awesome. The tacos are delicious -- knocking a star because they're a bit overpriced.\"], u'145.Hunger Pang': [u\"My family and I have been eating from Hunger Pang for years now.  For me, I love getting take out and eating it in my PJ's.  It's purely comfort food for me.  The staff is very friendly, accommodating, and courteous.  Chef at times comes through the front of the house and chats with the customers;  it's clear he is interested in being in the community.   The food presentation is probably not what one would consider traditional, however, the flavors and hospitality are.  The Pang fried noodles are a favorite among our family, we also love the dumplings and the fries.  The fries are decadent.  Actually, we haven't come across anything (regular item or special) that we've been disappointed in.  We've enjoyed immensely whatever we've eaten here.  Wonderful experience in house, great food to takeout for home.  Highly recommend.\", u\"This is a great place to bring a first date. That was the pretext on which I first came and it turned out great. First, the restaurant has a nice atmosphere - dimly lit with multiple tables and some individual seating adjacent to the window. They have a variety of menu options that are mainly Asian-American fusion style food with a fresh twist.\\n\\nI was debating between the burger and the fried rice but the waiter convinced me to get the burger. It was a beef short ribs burger and it was served with thin-cut fries. Very simple but also very well executed. The burger comes with three special sauces: one a flavored ketchup, the other a spicy sauce, and the last was a spicy mayo. I enjoyed them all and they came in these cute little squirt bottles. Definitely a fun food experience. The burger was tasty, a little over cooked to my liking, but still packed with flavor. The fries were heavenly and addicting - they cut them thin so it makes you feel like they're not as bad for you. \\n\\nMy date got the seared tuna over salad and seemed to enjoy it very much. It was quite a stunning plate. I will be sure to come again to try their wings and perhaps brunch!\", u\"Stopped by for dinner with my son who had just moved into the neighborhood.  We were both starving by that point and were able to get a table right away.\\nThe place is lovely and comfortable and our server was helpful and attentive.\\nWe ordered the pork, chive and cheddar dumplings as an app $8.  Kind of a small serving, but very tasty.\\n\\nFor mains we ordered the Short Rib Burger $16 and General Guan's Roasted Chicken for $21.  I really enjoyed the chicken, it was wonderfully cooked and seasoned with a fresh salad.  My only negative, and it's kind of a big one, is price point to portion.  I definitely thought $21 was too high of a price for what I got.  Also, I was taking my son out for dinner, so a $75 dinner (after tip and non alcoholic drinks, iced tea etc...) is not something that the average 20 something in this area is likely on any kind of regular basis.\\n\\nWhen we left he said that he really liked the place but would probably never return on his own.  Bummer.  It's too bad Hunger Pang doesn't mix up their menu a bit and offer a few options for the student on a budget.  Considering that my son mentioned 4 other grad students that he knows on his street alone, it could bring in some new business.\", u\"Unfortunate name, good food.  We were headed to the park and wanted something nearish by. Hunger Pan was on our to do list, so off we went.\\n\\nIf you are up for an evening of fried favorites, Hunger Pang has lots on offer. Fried dumplings with an awesome and unexpected frico crust (meat was less juicy than desired in the dumplings but the overall dumpling was yummy). Popcorn shrimp to satisfy the little ones. We weren't impressed by the citrus wings, I'm sorry to say - I suspect the chili version would be better. They just didn't have enough flavor and the coating was a little thick for my taste. \\n\\nThe truffle fries were fabulous. Get them.\\n\\nPan fried noodles were a hit, and the short ribs over rice was nice, although there's nothing particularly asian about it (except for the rice). More of a traditional beef in red wine reduction.\\n\\nBring cash, because if you don't, they will rain SHAME upon you at every turn for even thinking about paying by credit card. There are signs on the walls, signs on the menu, and even a business card IN YOUR CHECK billfold in bold red letters proselytizing against big credit. I get it. It's a little much.\\n\\nOverall, if you are looking for a nice meal and don't mind some fried food in the mix, you'll be happy at Hunger Pang.  I'm not sure we would return, but it made for a happy event on a sunny Saturday evening.\", u\"I am actually quite disappointed by the food. I had this place bookmarked for a long time and it was rated so highly on Yelp. I tried the jalape\\xf1o fried rice, pang fried noodles, pangry wings, and their fries. \\n\\nFries were bomb mostly due to the 3 sauces that came with it (hangry mayo, hoisin ketchup, and chili oil). I wasn't a big fan of the chili oil sauce but the other two tasted delicious! The wings were mediocre. I wasn't a big fan of the green sauce that came with it and the lemon garnish didn't really help at all. The noodles had too many different textures and seasoning that it wasn't that enjoyable. The fried rice didn't have much flavor, but I did like the overeasy egg on top. I never finished my food even though I was really hungry at first.\\n\\nThe service was fantastic here though. The waitress went out of her way to fix my wobbly table which was so sweet of her.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I most likely won't be coming back unless a friend wants to visit. I am not too sure if I just ordered the wrong dishes but I was really sad that only 1 out of the 4 dishes I ordered tonight was tasty.\\n\\nBut definitely try this place out yourself and just take my review as a consideration as this place did get 4.5/5 stars maybe for a good reason. I, on the other hand, would give this place 3.5/5 for the food.\", u'Pretty good fusion food. Loved the dumplings-crispy, cheesy and moist. The tuna bowl was delicious and refreshing. \\n\\nCrispy shrimp and original wings were very plain. Nothing special. Wide noodles with seafood was good and so was the steak with truffle fries', u\"Based on the stellar reviews I really thought this place would be a slam-dunk. I was sorely sorely mistaken. We had the honey ginger wings, fries, general Guan chicken, and the pang fried noodles. None of these dishes were exceptional, not even great. The wings were well cooked and the honey sauce they dipped then in was good but not great, I certainly wouldn't order them again. The fries were by far the best of bunch - crispy and thinly cut but it's pretty difficult to mess-up fries. They were served with 3 sauces: a mayo-based one, hoisin ketchup, and hot sauce. I enjoy spicy food but I don't like the run-of-the-mill hot sauces and this one falls into that category so I wasn't a fan. The mayo sauce just didn't work with French fries but the hoisin ketchup was quite good. Now the pang fried noodles should just be taken off the menu - it was that flavorless, barely any sauce, there was type of mushroom that was used as a garnish, I really like the texture but, again, was flavorless. The chicken was moist and the skin was passably crispy so that was a plus but wasn't a fan of the flavor. All in all, this meal was a fail. I will not be coming back. Gave it 3 stars cuz the wait staff was good.\", u\"I've been here twice and enjoyed it both times! My brother and I had the popcorn shrimp, cheddar dumplings, spicy tuna avocado bowl, hangry fries, pork belly eggs benedict and Korean bbq pulled pork sandwich. All were really solid choices. I've had better Vietnamese coffee. They don't drip it in front of you. Their spicy mayo is the best. This place should be more packed in my opinion, the food is really delicious! I was skeptical about asian fusion food but this place does it right. I'll definitely be coming back for more\", u\"I just want to say that this restaurant completely blew my mind! . I've always wanted to try this restaurant but I never really got around to it because I'm not really a fan of Asian Fusion food. I went to a restaurant with same cuisine a week prior and I wasn't really impressed.\\nTHE FOOD IS BEYOND GOOD. For appetizers, I had the pork, chive& cheese dumplings and the  salt & pepper popcorn shrimp. They were both really delicious. The silent winner was the pangry mayo that went with the popcorn shrimp. For the entrees, we shared the scallop shrimp over rice and the Hong Kong noodles with pork. The food is reasonable price and the portions are great. I actually took home some of my food.\\nThe dessert...... Green Tea Creme Brulee is out of this world. This place is so bomb. The food is exceptional. It isn't great for groups as it's a small space but the food is worth it. I will definitely be coming back to try the pangry wings. One of the best Asian fusion restaurants in Brooklyn hands down.\", u'Am not gonna lie.  When I get hit with a yen for funky Asian food served up in a Saturday night worthy dining space, Talde immediately leaps to mind.  With its always exceptional Roasted Branzino, plus some of its other consistently good menu items, it\\'s been an easy choice even though this spot is more convenient.  Because you see, I\\'d eaten at Hunger Pang a handful of times and for every dish I enjoyed, there always seemed to be something underwhelming or that I outright disliked (see previous reviews).   But recently, hubby suggested we give this place another shot, and in a *rare* weak moment, I agreed:\\n\\nSo anyway, the restaurant was packed on a Saturday night, and as a local, I\\'ll admit it did my heart good to see that.  Plus I also happen to LOVE the backstory of the Chef / Owner, making good in the neighborhood where he grew up.  That being said, I was a bit leery of going all in with both apps and mains so we stuck with just the latter:\\n\\nTuna - Avocado Bowl over Greens:  Though I thought the sauce tasted too tamari-heavy aka salty and for $18, it would have been nice to see more and bigger chunks of avocado and tuna,  I liked this!  Admittedly, I\\'m a bit green (get it?) when it comes to this whole Poke craze, but I think it would be awesome to offer some more substantial and / or fun toppings, like Garlic Krispies or Spicy Tempura Flakes for crunch or Edamame, or Seaweed Salad to add some heft...  \\n\\nJalapeno Fried Rice w/ 12-Hour Pork:  This was highly recommended by our server. Put an egg over just about anything and I\\'ll love it so I\\'m an easy mark for a dish like this, but it was satisfying in a spicy comfort food sort of way.  \\n\\nI was happy to see that Sriracha-like (housemade?) hot sauce is now an option.  On prior visits, I had bemoaned that only chili oil was available.\\n\\nThis meal gave me hope, and to borrow a quote from The Shawshank Redemption, \"hope is a good thing, maybe the best thing.\"', u'So I must\\'ve passed by this little gem a solid 100+ times, if not more, over the last few months. I\\'m mentally kicking myself for not stopping in sooner. \\n\\nThe pork and cheddar chive dumplings are seriously good. The dumpling itself is a little on the thicker side, but when topped with a thin layer of the crispy cheddar it makes for the perfect bite. We also started with an order of the fries which vanished from the table in 5 seconds flat. The housemade hoisin sauce was a nice change up from your standard tomato ketchup. \\n\\nNow onto the entrees. I decided on the pang fried noodles with the \"12 hour pork\" and my partner went with the general guan\\'s roasted chicken. \\n\\nDaaaaang. These noodles are no joke. Topped with a heaping pile of cilantro and a welcoming mix of fresh crisp veggies, this dish was so satisfying. The 12 hour pork was melt in your mouth good. Very little fat, but still tender and moist. Make sure to drizzle a little of the housemade hot sauce on top, you will not regret it.  \\n\\nMy partners roasted chicken was solid. The skin was crispy and the portion was huge, but he instantly regretted not ordering the pang fried noodles. Talk about a bad case of meal envy. We did not have a chance to try dessert because we were so full from everything else. It only goes to show that you\\'re getting your money\\'s worth. \\n\\nWhat took this from a 4 star review to 5 was the awesome service. Seriously. The folks at Hunger Pang are so nice and personable. Without a doubt we will will be back.', u'******UPDATE******\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and just come here. This place is absolutely amazing, I have never left disappointed and tried almost everything on their menu. Helpful hint - come for a date night on Sunday for their affordable pre fix menu. Appetizer, Entree and dessert for under 30$ \\n\\n********************\\n\\nI\\'ve never really been a fan of the \"Asian fusion\" restaurants but this place made me change my mind. The service here is great and so far, everything I\\'ve gotten from the menu tastes delicious.\\n\\nTheir pangry wings with honey chili sauce are the best wings I\\'ve ever had (and I say that knowing there\\'s an awesome wing spot down the street). I tried the pangry wings with the spicy citrus green sauce but would definitely recommend the honey chili instead. They are spicier but they\\'re more tender than the green sauce option. \\n\\nFor the main entree, I stumbled upon the creamy spicy tuna avocado bowl and now, I specifically come here to order it every time. This is a cold dish, like a large salad but with so much tuna!! Tuna is always fresh, tossed in a light honey Tamari dressing and veggies - like fresh cucumbers and other greens. I got it both over rice and salad and I would recommend it over salad. It\\'s a large dish and it will absolutely fill you up. I never end up finishing mine and always take it to go. It\\'s still fresh the next day. \\n\\nI\\'ve also tried the shiitake salad - mushrooms in salad greens have a great mild flavor with a light spicy(ish) dressing, topped with crispy garlic chips. \\n\\nTheir flourless chocolate cake is amazing. Resembles somewhat a chocolate lava cake but is light and very moist. \\n\\nHighly recommend trying this place. Personally I can\\'t wait to come back and try their other dishes!', u'I think Hunger Pang is the best restaurant that I\\'ve been to all year (and this is especially high praise coming from someone who absolutely loathes Asian fusion but now stands corrected). I can\\'t remember another place that had such good food and such considerate service combined. And I only had to wade my way through Santacon in the East Village to get here. \\n\\nI originally made a reservation for 6:45 which, in hindsight, was a great idea because the joint was popping on a Saturday night. The people at our table took their sweet time leaving, so we all clustered around the bar in the back to wait. The owner (?) recommended a sake - I\\'m not a sake person, as too many rounds of sake bombs have spoiled that fine drink for me, but the two I tried (Funaguchi Red and a rye premium version) were silky smooth. \\n\\nThe pangry wings and the pork and cheddar dumplings were amazing, but the stand-out dish goes to the complimentary bone marrow and crostini that the owner brought out as \"thanks for not being assholes while you waited for your table.\" The bone marrow was served with a kind of marmalade that was out of this world - it reminded me of spiced, slow cooked pork. Amazing. \\n\\nI ordered the tuna avocado bowl salad and sampled the fried rice and short rib ragu. Everything was delicious. You cannot go wrong with the menu. \\n\\nThe waiter and the owner (or maybe it was the manager) both swung by to see how everything was. Another table, as they were leaving, told our waiter that he made their night wonderful. I\\'m sad I don\\'t live close enough that I can become a regular. \\n\\nNEXT TIME: General Guan\\'s roasted chicken, green tea creme br\\xfbl\\xe9e', u\"I don't usually eat Asian fusion, but this place does it right. Their wings are to die for! They've also managed to make my dream come true with cheddar gyoza and a hearty poke bowl. Their portions are fairly large, so come hungry!!\", u\"The food was delicious - so many different flavors - and the portions were enormous. We ordered the three-course menu and honestly could have stopped eating after the appetizers, we were that full. The owner was also super friendly. We're looking at buying in the area and he took the time to give us loads of tips. If we end up moving in, we'll definitely be back!\", u\"I'm usually not a fan of Asian fusion, but Hunger Pang is excellent.\\n\\nChurch Avenue is definitely on the up and up. You can tell when a neighborhood starts having good Asian food instead of chop suey hole-in-the-walls.\\n\\nThe food seems very Chinese inspired, at least in my estimation. They have modern takes on dumplings, fried apps, and seafood.\\n\\nFor starters, we shared the Pangry Wings (fried chicken with a spicy citrus green sauce, which wasn't actually the spicy). Wings were super crispy, and the tangy dipping sauce was great with it. Because you can never have enough fried food, we also did the salt and pepper popcorn shrimp, which came with a spicy mayo dipping sauce. Of the two, I liked that more, but both were great.\\n\\nFor my main, I had the General Guan's Roasted Chicken. It was delicious, but be warned, the portion sizes are gargantuan. It was almost a half chicken, with the crispy skin slathered in honey, and tons of fried garlic chips on top. Because of my aforementioned affinity for fried foods, I went with the side of fries, which were advertised as the best in NY. They were pretty damn good fries. A bit thicker cut than shoestring, and the perfect amount of crispy and fluffy. You can also get them with truffle and parmesan, but even I have my limits.\\n\\nI also got to try the Pang Fried Noodles with 12 hour pork. That was their take on pan fried noodles, which is a staple of Chinese food. It was pretty good, and again, the portion size was huge!\\n\\nAll in all, I was a big fan of Hunger Pang and am looking forward to returning and trying some of their more adventurous offerings!\", u\"Got the tuna bowl, it was spectacular! Original dish that's perfectly blended with salad and rice. Will come back again!\", u'Every time I eat here, my stomach is always full and content. I\\'ve been to Hunger Pang a handful of times with my fianc\\xe9 since we live nearby. I have never been disappointed. The last few times, I have ordered the \"Pang fried noodles\" with their 12 hour pork and I think that\\'s my go-to dish now! Try dousing it in their hot sauce. Yummmmm! \\n\\nTheir menu changes from time to time but everything sounds so good. All the dishes that I\\'ve had are super fresh and flavorful. I love their popcorn shrimp and their pangry wings as a starter. I miss their spicy cucumbers though. I haven\\'t seen that on the menu recently. \\n\\nThey started serving a draft beer (War Flag Pilsner) recently and also two soju cocktails. They also have outdoor seating that I have not seen yet but maybe I will when the weather gets warmer. \\n\\nThe staff is always awesome even though I always see different people working there. It gets pretty busy on a Friday evening so get there at 6 pm when it opens so you are guaranteed a table!', u'I decided to go to Hunger Pang because of the high reviews I saw on Yelp. The first time I visited I ended up eating off of the brunch menu.  I ordered the ramen noodle seafood soup.  I thought it was a bit pricey for $15 but it was well worth it.  My sister and I split the cheddar dumplings and she order the steak and egg entree. Everything was tasty so we decided to come later on in the week for dinner.\\n\\nMy sister and I both had the price fixed meal but we decided to order the jalape\\xf1o fried rice which is not included in the price fixed option.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!!! She ordered the popcorn shrimp and I had the pangry wings.  We were sadly disappointed. I felt like the popcorn shrimp was too doughy and wet and the chicken wings were bland and had that raw egg smell on them.  For dinner I had the shrimp and scallops with jasmine rice and she had the tuna bowl.  We both enjoyed our entrees. For dessert she had the green tea creme br\\xfbl\\xe9e and I had the molten cake.  They both were delicious but we both preferred the creme br\\xfbl\\xe9e.\\nWhen I go back the only appetizer that I would have again is the jalape\\xf1o fried rice.  I think they need to revamp their appetizer menu, especially the wings.  Besides that the service is was good and the owner seemed like a pleasant, nice guy.', u\"Not bad.. we weren't allowed to sit in the benches because we were only a party of two (they seat 4), but the restaurant was pretty empty.. the meat was super soft, tuna avocado bowl was also pretty solid, but the flat noodles were kinda hard and not made that well. Didn't have the opportunity to try the previous menu, but heard it was better and cheaper.\"], u'40.Main House BBQ': [u\"From walking till it's time for a meal the staff is very attentive the food is awesome the place is clean.\\nI ordered their wings and hand-cut fries so delicious! I will definitely be coming back here\", u'Called them up women was not nice from the beggining took me 15 min to explain one simple sandwich i was waiting one hour for the sandwich to arrive i called up severel times no answer in order to cancell because it was taking too long finally i got a hold of them explained the women the situation she responded dont ever order from here ever again \\n\\nIll be sure to never recccomend anyone in the neighborhood to this place', u'Ate from here a few days ago, pretty underwhelmed. The lady server was lovely, seems like she has experience working in food hospitality which helped. Two kids doing food prep were pleasant, and doing their best. \\n\\nThe first thing I should point out is the price. Astounding, and not in a good way. 1/2 pound brisket, 20 bucks, 1/2 pound rib, 30... along those lines. Everything was along those lines. The sides, the drinks. Everything. \\n\\nI ordered a pound of the moist brisket, side of mash, watermelon lemonade and a cornbread funnel cake. Overall, pretty disappointed.\\n\\nBrisket - I ordered moist, and whilst it was cut from a whole side and intact... it was dry as a bone and chewy. Flavour was okay, not sure what they\\'re using to smoke. Comes with a \"bourbon peach chutney\" which is actually some sort of BBQ sauce, definitely not home made and no actual \\'chutney\\' component to speak of.\\n\\nMash: Tasteless and sad.\\n\\nFries: Burnt, still better than the brisket though.\\n\\nCornbread Funnel Cake: pretty good! Not worth the price though.\\n\\nWatermelon Lemonade: Just... just don\\'t.\\n\\nPretty disappointed in the food. The spot itself looks like it\\'s trying to channel Harlem hype-- already done elsewhere. And better. Still, cute for the Mill Basin area.\\n\\nWon\\'t be patronizing here in the future.', u'Hands down my new fav BBQ joint the short rib was awesome the meat was very juicy and tender the crust was perfectly hickory flavored and A bit of a mystique wooden kind of taste love it !!!', u\"I would rate Main house three and a half stars. \\n\\nI tried their brisket and pastrami. Both were soft and tender. The edges had a lot of flavor. I thought the pastrami was a little too peppery. I'd recommend both of the meats. I didn't enjoy the sides. I had the mashed potatoes and the cornbread. I thought the cornbread was dry.\\n\\nThe service was quick and pleasant. Most of the meats were priced $20-25 for a 1/2 pound. This restaurant is kosher.\", u'I ordered through Uber Eats. The pastrami sandwich was very good, although the best could have been fattier. The slaw, sweet pickles, and mustard maybe overpowered the pastrami a bit, but the sandwich was a winner. The brisket was moist, with a wicked bark and proper smoke ring. The sauce was great and the house made pickles were tart, sweet and crunchy.', u'Very Juicy BBQ chicken -Very delicious and try the lemonade strawberry-it was so delicious. One thing quite expensive for my meal-$31.59 for half chicken, fries and lemonade. But overall experience was great.', u\"Came across this restaurant while looking for a good BBQ spot to go to. Let me just say that I was in for a treat! Main House is officially one of my favorite locations! I've tried others like Smokehouse in Red Hook and it doesn't compare to the amazing food I had yesterday. There were plenty of choices to choose from and the entire menu is Kosher which worked out perfectly because I need to entertain some clients. We ordered lit of different stuff and it came out on a gorgeous platter on a butchers block. We had ribs, brisket and pastrami. No chicken or turkey for this meat eating crew. IT WAS ALL AMAZING! Mashed potatoes and cole slaw were also on point. Our server Jordan was great - patient and knew about all the items on the menu and I'm glad we listened to what he recommended. Will definitely be back again! Oh - they also play great music.\", u'Delicious  food & great service . Great place for the meat lover! \\nOverall, amazing food with good ambiance. Service was friendly and they will definitely help recommend what you should try.', u'On Monday January 16, Martin Luther King Day, I was stranded in Brooklyn waiting around for hours to arraign my client who had been arrested earlier in the day. Looking to get some good eats I searched for some BBQ in the New BBQ scene emerging in Brooklyn. After having left a Coney Island police precinct at 1pm I searched on YELP for nearby BBQ. I was led to MAIN HOUSE BBQ In Mill Basin. The restaurant was packed with couples on dates and large families. I found out through research that MAIN HOUSE is owned by several child hood friends from Brooklyn, and they names the restaurant after the kitchen/ eating hall in their summer Catskills bungalow community. It gets better - it\\'s Kosher! \\n\\nMy interest was piqued and I was very hungry. I start with a smoked chicken soup. Never had anything like it before. This is the real Jewish Penicillin. The broth you can drink forever, it has the smoky chicken flavoring. Home run! I then sampled a variety of meats wth a variety of mustards and Russian dressing. Brisket was tender and juicy. The Buffalo wings held the right spice and wasn\\'t a greasy saucy mess. Best wings I have had in a long time and I\\'m always on the hunt. The meats were smoked quite well and very flavorful. Shoe string French fries were a nice crunchy compliment to the meats. \\n\\nDessert was no disappointment. Fresh brewed coffee and fried Oreos! That\\'s right. Amazing with a drizzle of honey on top... \\n\\nThe best part, they have a gluten free menu. My wife was diagnosed with celiac years ago. I\\'m going back with the whole family who also love BBQ. Wonder where the kids get that from. Make a trip to Brooklyn and you won\\'t be disappointed in the BBQ Fare being served up in \"South\" Brooklyn.', u\"Guys this place Is an amazing spot in BK the food is filled with amazing flavor the food is totally hardy and the only word I can say is AMAZING it's a must for all BBQ lovers!!!!     I'm defiantly coming back\", u\"Hard to find delicious BBQ around here. This place is where it's at!\\nEverything about Main House BBQ is solid. Highly recommend!\", u\"I love BBQ. I am not a person who keeps kosher by ANY means. Just look at my other reviews - at all the fanciest and most notable steakhouses in Manhattan. I also enjoy non kosher bbq with friends all the time. With that said - I wanted to try Main House for a few reasons. First off - a friend of mine from Childhood started this place and my memories of hearing about their trips to upstate with their families always left me wondering what it meant to be a part of a community like that. I find the story around how Main House was started to be pretty darn amazing. Now for the food - AMAZING. I think anyone that is on the fence, should try it ASAP. The brisket, sliced thick - is absolutely incredible. I understand my declaration that my friend started this place may lead you to think this is coerced, or a review from a friend for a friend. Absolutely, 100% NOT THE CASE.  Happy to show you my 3rd order in a week which I made on Grubhub. \\n\\nConfirmation# 1137146937 2/23/2017\\nConfirmation# 1561971743 2/23/2017\\nConfirmation# 1681012653 2/28/2017\\n\\nThe pastrami is just as good as the brisket. I personally suffer from reactions to pepper, which is how you make pastrami - nevertheless, I still eat it even though I heat up from the spice. \\n\\nThe beef rib, is nothing short of spectacular. THICK, with just the right amount of fat. As I said earlier, please check my other reviews on steakhouses - one thing I know - is good steak / beef. \\n\\nHonestly give it a shot, and recognize that though the prices look high - the development of the bbq product from raw material to finished product is a long arduous task. The smoking alone requires a skill not easily mastered. You are buying a good product here, not a mediocre one, and good costs money. The same can be said when you order a steak from your local market - or you get a 30 day dry aged steak. One is mediocre. One is superb. \\n\\nGive it a try - you won't be disappointed. This I can promise.\", u'I own two restaurants of my own. So I know how a food establishment should be properly run. In my opinion this place has Amazing customer service, delicious food, and a very cool and chilled out atmosphere. Those are the three key aspects of the food business and they were five stars all across the board.', u\"Kosher BBQ in Brooklyn!!!!!! Now I'm not really a kosher eater (g-d forgive me) a lil bit pricey but I wanted to try out this spot because one of the owners is a friend wayyy back since high school. Now I'm gonna be completely honest with this review,The guys were very welcoming and made a suggestion that we get a smorgasbord of everything. The Ribs were freakin amazingly delicious I couldn't stop eating it, the Pastrami was very tasty but a lil dry for my taste buds. The brisket was WoW as well as the sides. Overall make sure you go here for delicious BBQ.\", u\"We loved loved loved the ribs,  brisket, and funnel cake. Also had good baked beans with burnt ends and mashed potatoes. Really nice vibe too, southern-lite, with beer and 80s hair bands on the sound system. \\nIn short, best kosher BBQ I've had.\", u'Had their moist brisket and it was great. Very flavorful, smokes and lots of fat. I had to deduct one star just for the price as compared to other places it was double the price at $40 per pound.  I would definitely consider coming back for more at some point.', u'Came here for dinner last night. Tried a little bit of everything. Sloppy Joseph sandwich was great and so was the pastrami. Overall a great meal. Definitely something different for the neighborhood.', u\"Fantastic food. The smoked beef ribs where a favorite, juicy and flavorful. Brisket was amazing, and so where the baked beans with nice amount of meat. Can't wait to come back.\", u'Went in for a quick lunch, i actually wanted to walk out once i saw the prices. The food was alright but in no way shape or form worth the expense. I dont mind spending money, especially on food, but this place does not give a sandwich justice to the price they charge. Def. will not return.'], u'158.CAVA': [u'Close to Exchange Place PATH...\\n\\nGreat selection of build your own bowl.\\n\\nFresh tasty and healthy... and no extra charge to load up on items.\\n\\nWishing for a CAVA to open close to me soon...', u\"The first time I came here, I had such a bad experience with the mobile app. I waited 30 min, they lost my order, I waited another 15 minutes, they didn't get my order right, it was horrible.\\n\\nI didn't go back for a while.\\n\\nBut there really aren't many great options for healthy food in the area, so I finally went back on a weekend when it wasn't so busy and had a much more pleasant experience.\\n\\nI do go there more often now.\\n\\nIt's like Chipotle but with grains/greens/sauces/meats. So a little more healthy? Depending on how you make your bowl I guess.\", u\"I love Cava and am beyond thrilled that it's made its debut in Jersey! \\n\\nIf you've never been, it's like a Mediterranean Chipotle or Roti style. Very fresh, efficient, healthy and hearty. \\n\\nI saw an advertisement announcing the opening of the Jersey City location and had to try it out. \\n\\nThe place was understaffed but all present were helpful and friendly. \\n\\nI recommend ordering a bowl if you like leftovers. If not, the salad or mini pita is plenty. \\n\\nThe spicy lamb and falafel were delish but not spicy at all. \\n\\nThe fountain drink options were all unique and I would order next time (cane sugar soda, green tea mint, orange spice, etc.) \\n\\nLimited street parking is available so go during off hours.\", u\"Love this new Mediterranean chain by Exchange Place! You have lots of options to choose from and the food tastes great! Be sure to grab a menu so you know what to order when you get to the front of line as it gets busy around lunchtime.\\n\\nThe setup of the place is like Chipotle. You choose a base (green, grain, or green + grain), protein, three dips, and unlimited toppings. I've tried their chicken, grilled meatballs, and spicy lamb meatballs (an additional charge), and I wasn't all that impressed with their chicken. I definitely go for one of their meatball options.\\n\\nThere are lots of healthy options and the food items aren't drenched in salt. It can be a light, refreshing, and filling meal depending on what you decide to put in your bowl. Brown basmati rice or lentils with super greens is my go to option!\", u\"A much-welcomed healthy option in the Exchange Place area...Chipotle-style (but with Mediterranean food).\\n\\nYou choose a base, a protein, and toppings. So far I've only had the grain bowl with basmati rice and falafel which is SO good (there are crunchy pieces of whole chickpeas). Toppings and dips are great too. I've had the tzatziki, hummus (both regular and red pepper), red pepper and eggplant dip, pita crisps, cabbage slaw, tomato and cucumber, and yogurt dill dressing.\\n\\nA little pricey but you can definitely fill up your bowl with toppings.\", u'Winner! \\n\\nJersey City was in a desperate need of a to-go Mediterranean spot. Think East Asian Chipotle. (korilla is your Asian Chipotle) \\n\\nAffordable and such a hefty portion you could most definitely have a bit and eat the rest for dinner. \\n\\nThe concept is quite simple. You pick your base whether that be greens, rice, beans - there\\'s so many options. \\n\\nYou then pick your meat, I opted for chicken and didn\\'t regret it. Not dry and fresh off the grill! Winner! They also have lamb, meatballs and veggies for you meat-haters. \\n\\nTop if off with sauce and toppings. \\n\\nGreat number of options, fast food and a decent price. \\n\\nPro tip: opt for the to-go it\\'s a bit bigger than the stay in option. \\n\\nAlso, please read the to-go menu in advance to figure out what you want before you head to the counter. It\\'s rude to hold up the line because you \"haven\\'t decided\" what you want.', u'I spend my work week on the upper level of Harborside Plaza: with the pop-ups in the food court and food trucks lining the side streets, there isn\\'t exactly a shortage of lunch choices. Cava is still a welcome addition to the area.\\n\\nIt\\'s a cliche to refer to a fast casual place offering a customizable meal as \"the Chipotle of (insert cuisine)\", but it fits. Cava gives diners a combination heavy Mediterranean meal with fresh and tasty ingredients. Choose your base (greens, grains, pita), dips/spreads (hummus, harissa and others), mains (chicken, beef, lamb, roasted veggies), add ins (fresh and pickled veggies and herbs), and a dressing. \\n\\nWith a line leading out the door on opening day, I went just before noon on a Saturday and got in and out in minutes with a solid lunch: a bowl of arugula and brown rice topped with a red pepper babaganoush, harissa, and \"crazy feta\" (their own whipped feta and jalapeno spread), braised shredded lamb, mint, pickled onions, and a tomato and cucumber mix, finally drizzled with lemon herb tahini. \\n\\nThe meal isn\\'t cheap (bowls will run about $10, or $2 more if you spring for lamb) and the flavours are a bit muted, but Cava is a great lunch choice. And, with online ordering, you can beat the lines.', u'Finally a place to grab a greens and grains bowl in Jersey City at lunchtime.  Dressings are made fresh every day.  Falafel has whole chick peas in it and the outside is crispy.  Inside is smooth creamy and flavorful.  This is far from the usual ground up dry standard falafel.\\n\\nBasil Lemonade is more basil flavor and I love it.  Tastes like summer in a glass.\\n\\nHours are 11-10 PM.', u\"LOVE Cava! Grabbed lunch here this week and it was scrumptious! My coworkers and I got there at noon. The line was already long, but it moves fast. While we waited, we were given delicious samples of the juices they had that day. I was able to completely customize my meal. My lunch came out to $10.50, and I could've definitely split it into 2 meals...but it was so delicious, I ate the whole thing ;) will be back again! But will probably order ahead or come a little earlier to avoid the line.\", u'Excellent new place in Jersey city.\\n\\nFresh food and quick.\\n\\n4/5 stars due to the inability for the app to interface well with the store.\\n\\nHopefully this will improve over time.\\n\\nRecommend.\\n\\nUpdated- app is fixed.  Great place in Paulus Hook for healthy clean eating.', u\"Nothing new about their food. But new thing is surely their veggie balls 'falafal' which I am not aware the type of. It does not give me feel like it's real chick pea made falafal. Are they really Mediterranean item? Also the dressing the veggie, I don't find so exiting. There are really good med chain restaurants everywhere with good material out there. It's sour in taste when I had hummus, egglpant plus spicy. Not worth this big hype honestly. I prefer Cart made falafal than cava.\", u\"Couldn't even finish the bowl. The feta cheese, if you decide to use it in your bowl, literally overpowers every other taste in the bowl. Nothing really stood out to be as having a blended coherent taste. It seems all just thrown together.\", u\"Four stars!  But I could see this climbing up the star chain after subsequent visits!\\n\\nMy colleague and I decided to give CAVA a try during our work lunch break.  Conveniently located in Exchange Place, it's decor is inviting and modern.  The long line we had to endure actually went by pretty quick as the workers here are pretty damn efficient.\\n\\nI went with a grain bowl with spicy lamb meatballs.  Topping, dressings, and dips included tzatziki, harissa, pickled onions, and tomatoes.  Excellent!  If you want to eat and workout (sweat) at the same time, get the harissa.\\n\\nTry to review the menu before you get called to place your order.  The variety of customizable choices can be overwhelming - which is a good thing.  Variety after all is the spice of life!\\n\\nI'll be back CAVA!\", u\"Finally! This is like the Mediterranean version of Chipotle that I have oh so long been awaiting. \\n\\nThe food here is delicious! I work close to here, so I love that they have the app that you can pre-order and pay on, then just pick up. You don't have to wait in line, you just go to the pick-up section and they have your order bagged with your name on it. \\n\\nThe food always tastes fresh and well seasoned, and they give you a huge portion for just around $10. They have a nice selection with a ton of different sauces, so it makes it easy to get something new every time. They also give you pita bread, which is a must for any plate like this. :)\\n\\nThe staff here is nice, too. I'm glad they opened this spot in JC.\", u\"I really really enjoyed the food here! It was tasty AND healthy. I had the salad with falafel - half spinach / arugula, tzatiki, really spicy (like beware it's super ) red hummus, falafel, feta cheese, peppers, and the apricot + spicy Greek yogurt dressing on the side. I would recommend the combo! There's also lentils and meats available here but I don't eat those so can't attest to their taste!\", u\"Probably best to order ahead online. It's exactly the chipotle concept but Mediterranean food. I ordered the half grain and half green with chicken, it also comes with three toppings, I chose the hummus, harissa and tzatziki, the toppings are unlimited, I was greedy and asked for a little bit of everything and topped it off with mint and the spicy apricot sauce. Service was quick and efficient. No complaints whatsoever. The portion of the food was so much that I had half and saved it in the fridge for tomorrow's lunch. Incredibly flavorful. Also it comes with a complimentary pita bread. Would definitely order ahead of time next time which will be sometime this week. What a great find in jersey city.\", u'The service was great and the staff was very friendly. I went with my parents who are always confused at places such as these. The staff answered all the questions and let them take their mind. Best of all it tasted great!\\n\\nI highly recommend the siracha yogurt dressing!', u\"I came to pick up lunch. First time, wanted to try it out, concept sounds cool, love Mediterranean food. I got a bowl with superfood salad. Love the salad options, added some lentils as the grain. On a healthy kick so have been trying to do low carb. Definitely able to do that here. The components of the salad all are delicious. I had red pepper hummus, the eggplant and the harrisa. Add on the chicken and some pickles, cucumbers etc. bit of feta cheese, and voila! A meal that was healthier than most lunches I've had, not breaking the calorie bank, and delicious as hell.  \\n\\nDefinitely coming back. Haven't checked if they delivered,  but I may also do pickup after work for dinner. Great to have this in the neighborhood. It's like chipotle for Mediterranean but better!\", u\"Finally, Jersey City has some great fast casual.\\n\\n- Fresh, tasty ingredients! The veggies were crisp and flavorful\\n- Delicious sauces and dips. The hummus and harissa were quality.\\n- You can add lots of ingredients to your bowl: grains, greens, three dips and unlimited toppings. That's awesome. The food is both healthy and tremendously flavorful.\\n\\nIncredible quality. Nice ambiance.\", u'Every component of my bowl was delicious. The falafel had good flavor. I had one piece that was somewhat dry. The sauces were all very good and refreshing with herbs and tang from the yogurt. Definitely was a satisfying bowl.'], u'11.Brooklyn Crab': [u'amazing spot. Great authetic beachside decor and service with a great selection of draft beers.\\nNow on to the food. Chilled crab claws appetizer were fresh and amazing but on the small side (not as big as you would get in Joe Stone Crab in Miami).\\nFor the main course the King Crab and Dungeness Crab in Cajun were well done, good size, fresh and meaty. GREAT FOOD and Crab done right. We had cole slaw and corn as sides, they come with the main food portion, sides were also delicious and fresh.\\nI think some low reviews come for the price aspect (as our bill for two came out to $150 (including tip).', u'We only went here because Home cook BBQ, next door, was way to busy at the time.  It was cold out so we got a seat on the 3rd floor. The ambiance was okay and they were quite busy as well despite being located in the deep end of Red hook all the way by the water. \\n\\nWas quite pricey and mediocre seafood. I would give the food a 3 star as I did enjoy my salmon  I also got some claws that I did not like at all and cost $3 each I believe. 18 for half dozen. Waste of money. \\n\\nService was horrible. Deserves a 0 star. Never came to fill up our water. After done eating and requested check we waited for 40 minutes for waiter to come back. Will never be back.', u\"This place is a drip city.\\n\\nThe spot is great for grabbing a drink but i do not recommend coming here to eat.  What a let down. Spent over a hundred dollars for the most bummer amount of food ever.  I feel bad for my friends who ordered crab rolls at $24 bux a pop and received the saddest amount of Alaskan crab i'd seen yet.  Could have gotten an amazing lobster roll at Red Hook Lobster pound for that amount of money and have at least received more bang for your buck.\\nThe clam chowder was fine.  Nothing special to be honest but was good filler until I could eat real food.  Would come again for drinks and to watch the sunset but that's about it.\", u\"I love this place because of the Locale. it is spacious, with 6+ spaces where you can eat, drink and be merry! The cocktails are pretty good and the beer selections include local breweries.\\nThe food is a bit on the pricey side but sitting upstairs in an open dining space makes it an experience. There is a wait but if you grab a drink at the bar, the time wait won't seem like much.\", u\"Its official, this place gets a BAD RAP. Why? I have no idea.\\n\\nIts beautiful, it sits on the water, you get the breeze, you get the community sharing a bench w other brooklyn folk, there's mini gof, i mean, all that and the food is great! For a moment, between a pina colada and a view of the water, you forget you're still in Brooklyn.\\n\\nI debated with my wife abour giving this spot a 4 or a 5, and what pushed it up into that 5 spot was the service. We had server Bryant(James Harden beard dude) who was quick, attentive, and brought us every hot sauce you guys had introducing us to the NYC hot sauce and the screaming skull one. He also saved my wife from getting whole crabs when shes only used to eating crab legs.\\n\\nWe started w the pina coladas, bomb. The calamari was on point, i wasnt sure about going fried at this spot but it worked out. The crab claws were the best of our two appetizers, but I would serve a butter sauce w the crab claws, and that aoili with the squid instead of marinara.\\n\\nEntree wise, were still going back and fourth, i 100% think my dungenous crab was better, it was sweet, fresh tasting, this is the crab spot and they delivered. The alaskan crab had my wife finish her food before me it was so good, and im supposed to be the expert. I was full and satisfied.\\n\\nSitting w a few people, i believe a lot of negative reviews come from people ordering the wrong thing. I understand theres crab rolls and all that, but they are 100% about their crab legs and even the fried food was good. The prices are a but high, but people gotta know the crabs are where its at.\\n\\nI had a great meal, it was a great service, defonitely coming back a few times before tge summers up\", u\"This has got to be one of my favorite places to eat, but sadly, they won't take my 14-16 person reservation for my Birthday. :( :( :( :( :(\\n\\nSo, I figured I would take my chances and arrive an hour early to get a couple of tables put together. Sadly, these people will not even put you on a list when you get there, and you are telling them that on this rainy, cool summer evening, that they will not accommodate you in any way, even when you are bringing 14 people. They would not even set up the tables until EVERYONE had arrived. They would not take orders until EVERYONE had arrived. It's just effing weird. Are they in NYC or on Mars? WTF is going on with that? This is very poor management. \\n\\nI did have a good time after all the annoying coordination finally was over, and my guests were miffed. \\n\\nI must say that our server, Chris, was excellent, always positive and always trying to get everything just right. You'll be happy if you get him as a server!!\\n\\nThe mussels which I raved about in my previous review are not the same anymore, it was more of a weird brown garlicky sauce. The chef has definitely changed. The potatoes came whole (not in wedges). But overall it was an ok experience. I probably would never ever do it again, though.\", u\"Hung out at Brooklyn Crab on a beautiful Saturday summer evening. Ordered a few local beers as well as a Snow Crab Roll.\\n\\nQuality\\nIt was an absolutely gorgeous day outside and we wanted to sip some beers and enjoy the weather, so my friend recommended Brooklyn Crab. Upon arriving we immediately realized this would be the perfect place to do so. There was a line at the entrance, which at first worried us, but we quickly learned that was just for upstairs table dining, we could enjoy the rest of the space without worrying about any wait. Once inside we grabbed some draft beers and took a seat on the back patio. The plan was to eat after our visit, but after seeing some of the food I decided to get a little something, and the Snow Crab Roll sounded perfect. It was pretty good, lighter on crab that I hoped. The crab itself was very good as was the seasoning and sauce, but it only provided three or four bites and mostly bread.\\n\\nQuantity\\nWhen it comes to seafood you know it is going to be smaller quantities, especially if it is better quality. However, I was still disappointed in the size of the Snow Crab Roll. It was only three or four bites and it did not have nearly enough crab on it.\\n\\nValue\\nThe food at Brooklyn Crab was expensive, as were the drinks. It is a very cool environment and an awesome place to hang out, but that only makes you feel the prices of the food and drinks more. It was a Saturday so I don't believe there were any specials going on, but it is a place that you would want to check for specials before visiting.\\n\\nAmbiance\\nThe truly special part of Brooklyn Crab is the downstairs playground that they have created. Located in the Red Hook area of Brooklyn, Brooklyn Crab is only a few steps away from the water. The space is extremely unique with three levels all with a different degree of outdoor space. The two higher floors appeared to be set up for more formal dining, and with that luxury came a short wait in line. Looking to wander and enjoy the space the more casual bottom level made more sense for us. Right near the entrance they have corn hole set up on the left and a covered bar area on the right. After grabbing a drink we continued to move towards the back area, which is awesome. They have two tents set up, one for food and one for drinks, each with covered picnic tables. More corn hole games can be found in the back as well as a tiny miniature golf course, which seemed great for kids. Patio chairs and more comfortable tables were also in this back space. Unique graffiti and art covered the walls and awesome summer time jams played over the speakers. There were an assortment of fans and water misters to ensure everyone kept cool, though a few of the misters were a bit too aggressive. The only real negative was the use of porta potties, which although necessary left certain spots smelling nasty.\\n\\nCrowd\\nOn a nice summer day every part of the space was packed. A good sized line had formed for the formal upstairs seating. The bar area towards the front was completely packed. Each game of corn hole as well as mini golf had a wait. But the chance to sit outside near the water and enjoy some drinks is too hard to resist. The crowd varied from families with young kids to young adults out to enjoy some drinks with friends. It is a great spot for a big group because even when busy there is enough seats for everyone.\\n\\nService\\nTwice during our visit the internet went down, which was a problem because they rely on the internet for each order. That slowed both drinks and food, which had more than a few people upset. One time is understandable, but two miscues in just a few hours is a problem. We ended up leaving after we saw the lines multiplying because no one could order again.\\n\\nParking\\nWe were able to find easy street parking about two blocks away. The nearby area is mostly warehouses, so on the weekend finding parking should not be much of a problem. Just be sure to read signs because they were towing cars illegally parked nearby.\\n\\nExtra\\nWhile Brooklyn Crab has its flaws, it also has a unique vibe that makes it a fun place to hang out. The key is finding out the times when they have drink and food specials so you don't spend a bundle while hanging out. Regardless, on a nice summer day, it is tough to beat this as a place to drink a few brews.\", u\"I really like this place but I have to knock off a star for long wait time and for small food portion size.\\nFirst time we went was in May and it was good no problems. First time we got the shrimp appetizer and the calamari appetizer and the side of red potatoes. The potatoes were boring and unseasoned and small portions for the price so I wouldn't order them again. My partner liked the shrimp and the calamari. But he thinks they were just ok, nothing great. \\nLast night we went a second time. Again long waits for a table. Like 40 minutes. But the wait time isn't a bad thing because the atmosphere is so fun, corn hole games on the first floor, a huge bar to buy fun flavored drinks from. And you're by the water so you can go for a romantic walk. \\nAnyhow, the food last night has me torn. I ordered the salmon. Which is probably the best salmon I've ever tasted! Good portion with honey glazed sauce and it just melts in your mouth. My partner ordered the shrimp basket meal (NOT APPETIZER!) and what he got made him so mad (I'll post photos). He got a basket full of French fries with 8 pieces of shrimp on it for about 20$! That's unfortunate. \\n\\nService: good. The people who work here Are constantly running around so if they are slow to see you it's because they are working hard (not sitting around).\", u\"In the city but want to feel like your down the shore? Brooklyn Crab is the answer.\\n\\nMy family and I went here over the weekend for lunch and drinks - I was shocked when we got here. It is an adorable outside bar that makes you feel like you are down the shore rather than in Brooklyn, NY. The ambiance is adorable with patio tables on rocks and corn hole!\\n\\nIn addition to the cute ambiance, the food is simple and delicious. We ate at the bar and were limited to the bar menu but we all loved our choices and got our seafood fix. The costs was affordable. My party had a mix of crab, hot dogs and shrimp. We all left happy!\\n\\nFinally their drink menu was very fun! Most of us had margaritas which were delicious and spiced up with a different twist of flavoring and spices as the garnish around the rim rather than the traditional salt. The crab cooler was also a fan fav where you got to pick a liquor and mixer of your choice. \\n\\nWe LOVED Brooklyn Crab and cannot wait to go back! It's a must go in Brooklyn Ny!\", u\"Enjoyed the shrimp popcorn. Great views from the 3rd floor and it's in the heart of red hook\", u\"Breezy Friday summer night - made a open table reservation. Dining is upstairs, we were on the 3rd floor.  The space is open with lots of room for big groups and booths. \\n\\nFood is 3.75/5 but service is 3/5. \\n\\nWater is always full and drinks come fast, the food is cleared quickly. However our waitress wasn't up for chatting or even recommendations. \\n\\nMussels have a delicious buttery sauce with red pepper flakes that give it a kick. The bread that comes with is soft, ask for more to dip!\\n\\nCalamari is crispy and barely needs sauce as its seasoned well. Cornbread is nice and buttery and you can taste the jalape\\xf1o. Coleslaw was what you'd expect. Husband hates his oysters, questioned the freshness and didn't say too much about the swordfish special. My Alaskan crab roll could've use a bit more crab and the roll more toasted. I wasn't able to enjoy the two sides of butter that I got bc my bread for soggy and there wasn't any to dip. \\n\\nWould rec as a fun place for a group.\", u\"Way overpriced but nonetheless the food is good. Crab legs are more for the experience because it's obvious that it takes tons to actually fill you up. This place was nice, the sunset and view was pretty and the vast collection of hot sauces was really cool!\", u\"Great vibe - perfect for when you just want to hang out outdoors and in large groups. It's right near the water so there's a great view. There's also some games at reed park in the back and the drinks are actually decent. \\n\\nThe 3 stars? The food is overly priced but that's what it takes for having decent seafood, particularly crabs, in NY! For a shared meal, it cost 8 of us almost $100 each and yes we had a little of everything but that's a little expensive for an okay meal just to get together. \\n\\nGood service otherwise!\", u\"We were surprised to see how busy it was on a Wednesday evening. Service was okay. Food arrived rather slow -- 3 star\\n\\n1. We ordered a dozen $1 raw oysters. They were super tiny like the size of a clam :) you would expect them to be for this price -- 3 star\\n\\n2. Then we had the fried calamari. Not sure if this dish was left at the counter for a while because it wasn't piping hot and the calamari were soggy :( -- 2 star\\n\\n3. The fish and chip was delightfully hot and the batter was crispy and fresh. The fillet was nice and tender -- 4 star\\n\\n4. Jumbo crab roll. Nothing special in my opinion. Bread was lightly toasted. Crab meat and the sauce was meh -- 3 star\\n\\nSurroundings was pleasant during a summer night. People were having fun playing the bean bags at the bar area.\", u\"First time here- Looked promising and food looked good. We ordered the lobster Mac and cheese & the fish and chips. Both were very bland and really disappointing. The ONLY thing we enjoyed was the clam chowder as an app. We didn't finish anything else. Really disappointed because we were excited when everything came out.\", u\"There was a bit of a wait for a table but what could I expect it was a Saturday night and we had a party of 10.  They sat us on the upper level with a waitress Meagan who was very nice and always came to check on us.  She always was ready to bring us more beers, napkins etc.  The food came out pretty quick and it was good.  The dessert on the other hand wasn't good at all. The ran out of cheesecake so we decided to go with the brownie cookie and it was hard as a rock and barely warm.  I would definitely recommend this place.  The view is spectacular!!!!!\", u'You can imagine the shock when I got the bill for two people for lunch. $120! (And I am not cheap when it comes to food!)  \\n\\nThe real reason we go to this place (every now and then) is for the view. Not the food! Love sitting upstairs looking at the water. \\n\\nFor lunch we had the New England clam chowder, which was good (nothing special), breaded shrimp with fries and cole slaw, and one of the \"rolls\". We also had dessert.  The food was mediocre as it always has been. \\n\\nThey need to lower their prices or offer a lunch menu, bc the prices do not reflect the quality of food. \\n\\nService was very good btw. \\n\\nWill I be back? Probably not...maybe once per year, but not more than that!!', u'Visited Brooklyn Crab for the 1st time last weekend after hearing great things about it and i must say, it lived up to my expectations!! \\n\\nI ordered the Brooklyn Crab Royale for two which was amazing. It was sized perfectly for people, and came with 4 pieces of corn and 2 cole slaws. The market price was $130, which is a little steep for 2, i think, BUT the food made it worth it. The 3 crab types and the lobster were boiled to perfection. The meat was tender and sweet for all, and the garlic butter dipping sauce was heavenly. \\n\\nThe service was great too. Waiters come around very often to empty your shell baskets and bring over more butter and wet naps. \\n\\nLastly the views were amazing. If you sit on the top level you can see the statue of liberty and of course nice views of the river. I will definitely be returning.', u\"I came here for the first time last weekend and it was overwhelmingly subpar. First, it's pretty tough to get here from Manhattan, as you'll have to ride the IKEA ferry. It's right next to Hometown BBQ, which is great since you can swing by after.\\n\\nYou'll notice immediately that it's very packed (on a nice day), and very fratty. The line to get to the restaurant is very long, so you might choose to skip the food and instead head to the front or back for drinks. The bar is crazy crowded and the service is pretty terrible here. Not only are the drinks not well made, but it takes a long time for the server to notice you. I guess that comes with the territory of being at a packed bar/restaurant. \\n\\nMy friends ordered a few of the crab rolls ($15) - it came out to be pretty small and underwhelming with flavor. Not to say that it took a half hour for it to arrive.. \\n\\nWith all these factors - 1) rough location to get to 2) terrible service 3) subpar food/drinks - I probably will always choose to come to a different daytime bar.\", u\"The place itself is 5 stars: you feel less like you're in Brooklyn and more like you're in a New England seaside resort. It's especially lovely on a summer's evening, with the outdoor seating, lights strung up and nice views. \\n\\nBut the food is definitely 3 stars, and given the prices they charge and the other fantastic dining options not far away (try Petite Crevette for seafood) that's not acceptable. The salmon was over cooked, dry and had no flavor.\"], u'27.Pies-n-Thighs': [u\"Delicious southern comfort food \\n\\n// LOCATION // Williamsburg\\n\\n// SERVICE // Excellent. All the waiters were all very attentive\\n\\n// WAIT // No wait during the week days for lunch. \\n\\n// FOOD // \\n     + Rob Evans on a biscuit: Cheese and scrambled eggs on a biscuit with gravy. I opted for gravy on the side and it was very rich which chunks of sausage. The biscuit is so fluffy and delicious. \\n     + Chicken and waffles: One of their signature items. The chicken was juicy and well fried with a good crunch. The multi-grain waffle was not my hubby's fave, but I did like the fruit topping.\", u\"Came here on a Tuesday night and the place wasn't too packed. The servers were very attentive and sweet, but I think the food was just okay. I ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of sweet iced tea and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was actually really good but I think the waffle was kind of disappointing. Maybe because it was whole wheat but I thought it was a bit dry. \\n\\nThe chicken was really juicy and delicious though, and the portion was perfect too. I didn't think the portion was too small or large. The sweet tea wasn't that sweet for me and my friends lemonade was way too tart! Overall .. my experience was okay. Maybe I will come back and order something different, we will see.\", u'Horrible. We showed up on Saturday at 3:45pm. Did not realize it closed 4-5pm until we arrived which is fine although it was frustrating as that is prime eating time for a Saturday. They let us order takeout but made us wait outside. While waiting we saw an interaction with the hostess and a customer where she ended up not getting seated because of miscommunication which just seems ridiculous. We ate outside on a bench outside. \\nOnce looking at the menu, we found out that we could not get dinner items and only brunch which seems confusing since was later afternoon. While waiting for our food outside \\nWe ordered the catfish which was okay and not something I would probably order again. Had to walk inside to get hot sauce to put on it, I felt like an idiot. \\nMight come back but probably not.', u\"Came on a Sunday evening around 7pm and was able to get a table for 2 immediately. \\n\\nBeer battered zucchini: delicious! It was fried nicely and they drizzled it with a little bit of honey which gave it a nice sweetness. Also tastes good with hot sauce.\\n\\nChicken waffles: comes with 2 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. The chicken was fried really well. It was crunchy on the outside and hot and moist in the inside. Most importantly, HOT. I love my food hot off the press and the chicken delivered. Flavorwise, it was decent and I enjoyed the chicken.\\n\\nWaffles: the butter and fruit on top, gave it a good flavor. The first couple of bites were good but I got tired of it by the time I got to the second piece.\\n\\nMy bf got the chicken box, which has 3 pieces of fried chicken, 1 side (he chose mac and cheese), and a biscuit. ALL his pieces of chicken were NOTICEABLY bigger than mine. He enjoyed his chicken. \\nMac and cheese was disappointing. It was lukewarm when served and not enough flavor.\\nBiscuit was flavored nice and buttery. But it would've tasted better if it was hotter, like fresh out the oven hot. It was just lukewarm like the mac and cheese.\", u\"Pies 'n' Thighs is a fried chicken joint serving up all those Southern specialty plates you'd expect and want. The spot is usually busy so you might have to wait a little but trust me it's worth it! The fried chicken is the headliner in the menu and is part of nearly every plate. The chicken is fried perfectly. A crispy tasty batter covering large pieces of chicken. The collard greens were amazing. The mac 'n' cheese was rich, cheesy, and pasta cooked al dente. The Cat fish was cooked to perfection and season just right. Everything here screams Southern packing a mouthful of deliciousness. \\n\\nIt smells insanely good as soon as you walk into the door.  It's cozy and comfy.  The service is great. This place is a definitely a must try if you love chicken. Very small in the inside,  but has a home feel. Services is always excellent.  Food here is for the soul!  I will definitely be coming back. A well needed fixture for the neighborhood.\\n\\nUndoubtedly one of my favorite restaurants in NYC and most certainly one of the best soul food joints around. Pies n Thighs serve traditional soul food with an untraditional freshness and they do it impeccably. The ambiance is very laid back and the staff give good vibes only.\\n\\nEverything I've had here has been incredible. Great chicken, sides, and deserts. What more can you ask for?\", u\"After recently going to Root & Bone and being underwhelmed by the fried chicken, Pies-n-Thighs was such a great surprise.\\nCheap beers, fun atmosphere, and the chicken biscuit smothered in butter and hot sauce was the best thing i'd eaten in weeks.\\nCould not recommend more.\", u\"My friend might have set me up for failure when he told me this was the best fried chicken place ever. It's hard when expectations have been raised. My second warning would have been when the table next to ours told the waiter loudly that her chicken was bleeding..\\n\\nBut still, I gave it a chance. We went on a Friday night and the wait was minimal. The decor was cute but it's definitely cozy but rowdy. There was a large table having a family dinner and the environment was warm. Service was friendly but a little slow.\\n\\nMy friends and I all got the chicken box with dark meat. I got a side of mac and cheese with mine and it was creamy and cheesy all at the same time. Two out of three pieces of chicken were perfect- crispy skin, moist and tender meat and with just the right about of seasoning. It was the third piece that ruined it for me. As I bit into the last piece, I noticed the chicken was pink and not fully cooked. My appetite ended there.\\n\\nThe table next to ours had a new piece of chicken served to them. I told my waiter that I was full but that the chefs need to be more careful. His response was that he will, and that it's been happening because they hired new people. It was a robust night, but I still feel that food safety is important compared to wait time. No compensation of any kind for the undercooked chicken though. Luckily I didn't get sick but I'd be weary of going back.\", u'I ordered take-out from Pie-n-Thighs the other day because i was craving fried chicken. The place was packed on a Friday night. There were people waiting outside. \\n\\nFood: I ordered the chicken and waffle. The food was fresh and well packaged. I had to wait a few minutes to eat the fried chicken because it was hot.\\n\\nPrice: I paid $15 for two pieces of chicken and waffle. I did not get a drink or sides. It would have been close $30 if i got those. I think it is a little pricey but i get it, I am in the heart of Brooklyn.\\n\\nWait: I waited for 15 minutes for my food. I get that there is a look of people but that is a long wait considering this a a chicken place. Their chicken should be ready within a few minutes.\\n\\nSpace: The space in the front is small but i remember there was another space in the back.\\n\\nOverall: it is good to try for the first time but not recommended based on the price of the fried chicken. There are other comparable chicken places with more food, cheaper price and quicker service.', u\"Came in with visiting family because I'd tried this place once before, but didn't quite remember  how good the food was. \\n\\nI got the Chicken Biscuit and it was FIRE. And I mean fire like hot sauce on chicken with the biscuit sitting in a pool of delicious honey butter, fire. There is something about sweet mixed with heat that gets me every time. And this biscuit delivered. \\n\\nGood food at a great price and everything came out fresh. I got an Arnold Palmer, it was just OK. My sister and mom both enjoyed their meals.\\n\\nI mean it's chicken, biscuits, honey butter and hot sauce. What more could you ask for?\\n\\nGreat job Pies-n-Thighs.\", u\"Tried this place because of the awesome reviews and I was missing southern food. \\n\\nNo wait. Food came out hot. Server was nice. That's all the good things I have to say. \\n\\nChicken box with sausage gravy ($14.50) 3 pieces of chicken, a biscuit, and sausage gravy. Sausage gravy was really way too salty. The chicken was freshly fried and hot to touch. The skin was crispy. The flavor was bland. I've also had better biscuits. It was flakey, but not buttery enough. \\n\\nMac and cheese\\nSalad w/ ranch dressing \\nFrench fries \\nCorn bread \\n- that was a meal and I believe it was $10.50. Everything tasted like it sounds. Nothing memorable. Nothing you couldn't make at home. \\n\\nI saw a lot of people around me eating the honey butter chicken biscuit with hot sauce. That looked really good and a lot of reviews praised it. I wish I would have tried it. But I didn't. So. Maybe next time, but probably not.\", u\"One of my favorite brunches to date! Would trek all the way from Manhattan to Brooklyn for their fried chicken! The restaurant is extremely coxy and has a cool farm to table atmosphere. \\n\\nOrdered the Rob Evans Biscuits & Gravy ($10) and Fried Chicken Box ($14.50) - three pieces of fried chicken and we chose cheese grits for our sides. The chicken fried perfectly and soooooo juicy! Every bite was amazing and skin was so flavorful. I think the fried chicken is ranked one of the best I've had. \\n\\nThe sausage gravy and biscuits also had an egg on it! Amazing! The biscuits were perfectly flaky and came out warm. It went well with both the gravy (huge chunks of sausage) and also the cheese grits. We topped off our meal by ordering the apple pie a la mode (with ice cream) per the recommendation of our server - and we did not regret it. \\n\\nPortions were extremely generous. It was a lot of food - we had such a big brunch but still ate everything we ordered! We had to finish. Still dreaming about this meal!\", u\"With all the hype about how great their pie and fried chicken are, i definitely cannot miss out this place as a big fan of fried chicken!\\n\\nResult turned out to be... meh~\\n\\nMy standard for good fried chicken might be high, but I feel like it is reasonable. It has to be crunch, juicy, and well seasoned. The best piece to rate it from would be from the breast meat. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong though, chicken tastes good and fresh. Seasoning is very average... overall just average! There is not much I could say! Chicken breast is not hard, but just not impressive enough.\\n\\nBeing a very common dish that one could get anywhere, it is even harder to really get it done right.\", u\"This place is really good and a lot of food for the price.  My 12-year-old and I usually share a meal.  The brunch is also really good, get the biscuits and one of there many types of butters and jams.  It's also really nice to find a billyburg spot that isn't stuck up assholes.  Everyone was friendly and welcoming.\", u'Good service but my chicken and biscuit arrived COLD.  Flies flying everywhere,  little bugs on table. ..I feel dirty here. .\\nCorn was bland. \\nCollard greens was too oily.', u\"If you're in the area and need a good brunch spot, I would definitely recommend Pies-n-Thighs!\\n\\nI came here a few weeks ago after hearing many good things and it didn't disappoint. The wait wasn't more than 10 minutes on a Saturday and the atmosphere inside was welcoming. I came with a few other people so naturally we all ordered different things so we could sample off each others plates. \\n\\nI got the Chicken Biscuit, which was amazing. It's a fried cutlet in between 2 biscuit halves with hot sauce and honey butter. The hot sauce was like a better version of Frank's, which has a powerful flavor. I don't know how they did it, but the honey flavor shined through perfectly and was not drowned out by the hot sauce. I have never had anything like this dish before and I think its a must if you come here. My friend also got the chicken and waffles, which had some interesting toppings (blueberry and cinnamon butter) and was good, but I think I have had better at some other places in the city.\\n\\nFor dessert we had to go with a few pies...because you can't come to a place with Pies in the name and not try their fresh pies. I got the bourbon pecan pie, which I also thought was perfectly done and had so much flavor. My other friends got the smores pie, which I would also recommend, and the apple pie, which I thought was pretty underwhelming and lacking some flavor. \\n\\nAs if the tasty food hadn't made me happy enough, the prices weren't too bad at all. The Chicken Biscuit is on the smaller side, but for around $6 and pie slices for $5 you can't go wrong. Unfortunately, our waiter was also a bit blah so he could have made the experience a tad better, but I definitely plan to come back at some point soon!\", u\"If you haven't jumped on the bandwagon yet, then you are probably wondering, how can chicken and waffles taste that good?! Isn't that a weird combo?! That was my first initial questions before actually trying it.\\n\\nMy first experience having chicken and waffles was here! I been wanting to try and see what is the hype all about and let me tell you, the hype is REAL! \\n\\nIt is located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, so parking can be quite hard to find especially in a crowded afternoon. It is a fast paced restaurant, so food is served relatively quickly. My first experience here, the service was great and food was great as well.\\n\\nChicken and Waffles surely sounds like an odd combination, but you will be mind blown on how good it is! I definitely love the crispiness and the flavor the chicken had to offer. Definitely worth making a trip back just for some chicken and waffles!!\", u\"4.25 stars ! \\n\\nCame here for brunch this afternoon and it was a fantastic experience.\\n\\nI was with my good friend and girlfriend and we all ordered different things so I got to try a handful of delicious dishes.\\n\\nI got the chicken and waffles and it was really good. Not as good as Amy Ruth's in Harlem in my opinion, but still a delicious dish. The blueberries on top were good for show, but sort of over powered the syrup, waffle, and chicken flavor a bit too much. The cinnamon butter was superb and the chicken was fried and breaded nicely and cooked to perfection inside. Juicy, crispy, and crunchy - it was a perfect addition to the fluffy waffle. The syrup was delicious and at the table, so you could add as little or much as you wanted.\\n\\nWe split a bunch of desserts, most of them being excellent.\\n\\nThe chocolate chip cookie was nicely sized, chewy, flavorful, and full of chunks of chocolate.\\n\\nThe smores pie was rich, thick, and decadent. I really enjoyed it, but it was a tad small (at least compared to other pie slices).\\n\\nBourban pecan pie - excellent. It wasn't my favorite dessert, but it was for both of my dining companions. Nice flavor, generous amounts of pecans, and flavorful crust.\\n\\nApple pie - underwhelming. Good but not great. If you've ever baked one at home, it was probably better than this. Would have been better warm and a la mode.\\n\\nButter pecan crunch donut - WOW!! A real highlight of the meal. I highly suggest this. Its a unique flavored donut with a crunchy almost toffee like outside with a fluffy donut consistency inside. Not too sweet and had the perfect ratio of topping to bite.\\n\\nOn top of all this great food, is was relatively inexpensive, which is always a plus in NY.\\n\\nLastly, the reason I didn't rate this place higher was due to the service. Our waiter seemed like he didn't want to be there and wasn't particularly friendly. One example that seemed really odd was that we had three empty water glasses at the end of our meal and he came by and only filled one of them? So my friend asked him to top the rest of us off and he reluctantly did so. His lazy attitude wasn't a total deal breaker but it was a bit disappointing...\\n\\nAll in all, I am excited to come back and try more pies and thighs!\", u'YUMMMM. My mouth is already watering even THINKING about eating here. Real talk. Our first ever visit to Pies-n-Thighs was around 10PM on a Thursday night. We were hungry after a long day of travel, and surprisingly enough we actually stumbled across it as we were walking throughout BK. We were immediately lured in by the smell of hot chicken and the sight of people clearly waiting for whatever goodness lied inside. \\n\\nI don\\'t know why so many people are eating chicken at 10, nearly 11PM at night, but it was PACKED FULL. There was barely even room to stand inside. You\\'re not greeted by a hostess or anything right away, so we were a little confused as to how to be seated or where the \"line\" was. Once an employee saw us kind of aimlessly waiting, they put our name down and let us know of the wait. It was probably a good 25 minute wait until we got a seat, but it was definitely worth it. \\n\\nTheir menu is full of that good-time-lovin\\' southern cooking that reminded me of spicy, Texas fried chicken. It really felt like home. I ordered the chicken sandwich, and it did take about 40 minutes for it to come out. I believe our waiter forgot to put our order in and realized about 20 minutes in, but we were forgiving because they were super kind and apologetic about it. \\n\\nThat sandwich was everything and MORE. Flavorful, hot, classic fried chicken with just enough spice (after some hot sauce addition). It was sooo good. I could see this being some amazing post-bar food. Like yes.\\n\\nMy favorite part? They were playing reggae music the whole time. I don\\'t know if that\\'s the norm, but whoever chose the playlist for that night was on point. \\n\\nCan\\'t wait to come back!', u\"Yum! Quaint space, friendly service, tasty food. The fried green tomatoes were a rather unexpected and scrumptious surprise only to be topped by the catfish & grits. If I lived close by you can be sure this would be on the weekend rotation. If I didn't finish every last bite of my bfast I  might have had room for one of the freshly prepared treats.  I guess I'll need to stop in again!\", u\"Seriously a guilty pleasure. I don't think its possible to go wrong with any of the options on the menu. Saturday 6PM, we waited probably 10 mins for a table for 7. Not bad honestly. \\n\\nFrom the front, you might think the restaurant is small but there is a lot more seating in the back! As we were walking to our table, we passed by the display of sweets and our mouths started to water. Honestly the donuts were glowing! \\n\\nThe menu is simple: fried chicken everything with whatever side you could possibly want. Just kidding, there's also catfish! The boyf got the catfish box with Mac and cheese while I got the fried chicken box with collard greens. The catfish also came with cole slaw. The chicken came with a biscuit. \\n\\nI thought I could skip the biscuit but omg, that was my favorite part! Based on my previous reviews, you should be able to tell that I LOVE BREAD. This biscuit was the perfect biscuit, crispy outside with a flaky buttery fluffy inside. I peeled each layer and savored the taste slowly. The fried chicken was not like your usual popeyes/KFC. Every bite had a good crunch and a juicy bite of meat. The box came with a breast, drumstick and wing. The catfish box was much smaller than expected... but definitely great while it lasted. \\n\\nThe collard greens was very standard, nothing spectacular... but the mac and cheese was phenomenal! By the time I finished the chicken and biscuit, it was too late for dessert. I forgot to leave room for the glorious desserts... super upsetting but gives me a reason to come back. \\n\\nWhen in doubt, treat yourself with some bang in' fried chicken!\"], u'104.The OX Tavern': [u\"I live close by so I've dined-in on numerous occasions. Brunch on the weekend is typically jammed during the cold months, though worth it even if there's a wait (usually short). Go for the French Toast or Chicken Fried Chicken... yes, it's definitely worth it.\\n\\nStaff is very friendly and attentive... atmosphere is very family friendly and has a neighborhood vibe about it... something that's quickly disappearing in Brooklyn. \\n\\nHad a tiny episode of food poisoning on a recent dinner date, so that's the only reason why I'm not going 5 stars here. However, I called in and they offered us free drinks next time we visit :)\", u\"The cucumber margarita is to die for!  BEWARE of the mussels. After two separate visits I ended up in the same place - the bathroom 1 hour later at home.\\n\\nThat place is intimate, dark and cute but the bar sucks. The blonde guy is good on the eyes but he isn't memorable enough for me to return.\", u'Came here last night with some colleagues for a wine down and had a subpar experience. \\nWe walked in and realized that their happy hour had just ended but decided to stay and check it out anyway. It\\'s a pretty small place and it was really busy, so we sat ourselves down. Our waiter came over and took our drink orders then food orders. The entire time he stood there, I couldn\\'t help but notice that he was being a little bit sassy than necessary. I tried to ignore it and have a good time with my friends. \\n\\nI ordered the Fish N Chips entr\\xe9e (which obviously comes with fries) but I asked anyway \"Does it come with fries?\" - he responded in a sarcastic way but I just brushed it off. \\n\\nWhile waiting for our food to finally arrive, he brought over the appetizers we ordered. When my meal came it was a plate of fish and veggies... with NO chips lol. My friend and I who ordered the same thing, try to get his attention to notify him. So we tried calling him over since he kept rushing past us.. and we told him about our missing fries. He told us \"Let me go check on that\" and hurried off again. I accidently dropped my fork and knife so I tried to get his attention again to ask him for a new table setting. He was just so rude and seemed upset to be serving us (I really wonder why). After waiting over 20minutes for the fries and a fork.. I got up myself to ask him personally if he forgot about my fork. He just brushed me off and pointed to where the silverware was kept behind the bar .. \"They\\'re over there\". I was really taken aback by how rude and abrupt he was being with me so I reached out to a different waiter to ask about my fries. \\n\\nAfter I sat down, I asked this other waiter what was the name of my original server.. and instead of telling me he asked \"Why?\". Now this was really frustrating because I was just so confused as to why we were not being given satisfactory customer service by anyone in this place. After asking him for my waiter\\'s name three times, he defeated and said \"Carlos\" and tried to explain that they were very busy and understaffed blah blah lah.  I could honestly care less about understaffing or being busy.. that\\'s still not a justification to be outright rude to your customers for no reason. \\n\\nAfter that, I was over the entire experience of this place. My friends continued to finish their meals and ordered another round of drinks. The second waiter took over our table and tried to do some service recovery. In the end they gave us a free shot, which is the ONLY reason why I gave them one star. I will never come back here again though.', u\"Good place to grab a bite if you're from or in Brooklyn. The drinks are great. Place is small and has a bar, feels cozy and friendly. People working there are very nice.\", u\"Though it may be tucked away in a nice location on Argyle and Newkirk, there are many things that made my lunch less than descent. For a tavern, it doesn't have but three beers on tap, of which are $8 each and without my knowing from the waitress, $1 more for 22 oz. instead of 16. My burger was cooked and seasoned well, however the half melted cheese patty was less than desirable. No chipotle mayo and a burnt bun were also not great. I looked to the fries, and though nothing wrong with them, unnoticed that the ketchup tasted just like pasta sauce. Just come for beer, not lunch.\", u'After my husband raved about their burger, I had to come and taste the food for myself. Unfortunately, there is a lunch and dinner menu. Instead of the alamo burger (Fried Egg, Sweet Onion Ring, Barbecue Sauce, Pepper Jack Cheese) for $16 and yucca fries for $5, I sadly ordered the incomparable turkey burger (ground turkey, house spices, herbed mayo) for $14. You just do not know how disappointed I was that I made the trip and would have had to wait 3 more hours for the dinner menu to begin at 5pm. Though the turkey burger was filling, it just did not satisfy my appetite. P.S. With one server during lunch hours, service can be a little slow so try to give a complete order as quickly as possible.', u\"Litty a f. This place is small but cozy, and perfect for that intimate dinner with a significant other. Or your friend. Or yourself. I don't know your life. If you have a huge party, be sure to call ahead because this place gets packed quickly during the dinner rush. We luckily were able to find seating on Friday night but don't test your luck if you roll mad deep.\\n\\nI got one of their drinks on the wall, a Tilt on the Windmill, which had St. Germain, Aperol, gin, lemon juice, and champagne. A bit pricey at $13 but boy, was it good. My friend seemed to like her catfish and crawfish etouffee and my Good Ol' Boy burger was incredible: juicy, savory, and incredibly well-textured. The fries were full-bodied and shoutout to the slightly sweet ketchup that came with my meal. \\n\\nDessert was an interesting affair: we ordered the gingersnap Oreos only to be told that this dish was no longer served with gingerbread but rather two chocolate cupcakes with chocolate ice cream. We subbed in raspberry sorbet and that was definitely a good choice. The chocolate cupcake texture sort of clashed with the cream cheese and honestly, the flavor combination was fine but I wouldn't go out of my way to order it. I'd suggest going back to using ginger bread because I think it would have been a better fit for the dish.\\n\\nOverall, though, very pleased with my experience here.\", u'Food and drinks are always amazing along with the excellent customer service. My husband and I come in at least twice a month it is a must!', u'I walked a mile and half for their Friday night Happy Hour, leaving the wailing Shabbat sirens of my hood in my wake. What I love about this place is that it\\'s nothing flashy or trendy. The decor is a little Southwest meets old European man\\'s social club, but it completely invites you in. The specials were $6 glasses of wine, $7 Schoefferhofer Grapefruit beer and well drinks of any kind. Two drinks is all I needed to chill by the window and enjoy my company. Our server Jim was in charge of every table in the place, which filled up quickly with babies and their parents at the tail end of Happy Hour, but he still managed to be attentive to us. While it is a little bit of a \"family magnet\" that didn\\'t take away from MY experience (can\\'t say the same for my date). I know I will be back for brunch or a post grad school beverage soon. Thanks, Jim!', u\"Pros: It's unique. They have specials and drink menus on the walls, and interesting decor. They have a ton of burgers to choose from, with the option of veggie (not just a frozen, disgusting patty) and fish. I liked my margarita. The service was great...fast and accommodating.\\n\\nCons: Neither of us were wowed by our food. We got a veggie burger and fish and chips. As stated above, the patty was great. But, the burger itself was a little boring. It had no toppings... And was essentially just a patty and bun. I also found the prices to be a little high for drinks. \\n\\nOverall, I'm eager to give it another shot. I was wavering between 3 and 4 stars, but ultimately went with 4 because of the friendly service and cozy atmosphere. I could see it easily going up or down a star next time based on the food.\", u\"Great place to stop by after work. It's pretty busy so you might end up sitting at the bars for food. I got the Cali burger and it was really good (a bit pricey though $12). It had avocados, tomatoes, medium rare beef patty, and some sprouts. Very delicious and it came with fries. I'm not a huge burger fan but the meal was definitely enjoyable.\\n\\nI ended up sitting at the bar and it was a bit congested at first but as long as you have good company, you won't really notice it. Service was great too! Food came out fast. I would come back especially if it's in the neighborhood\", u'Love this place so much! Highly recommend for brunch or lunch with a date or with family. Totally relaxed and cozy.', u'Beautiful little tavern. Had a thoroughly good night. Great service from guys behind the bar!! Cocktails were fantastic and the food was top notch. I rarely venture out to Ditmas, but will be coming back for sure. Chris thanks for the great cocktails. Good conversation and a lovely atmosphere! 5*', u\"I called for a delivery order they told me deliveries started in 45 minutes, i waiited to order. Called back and then was told it would be another hour. These are horrible business practices, tell the customers when you delivery starts don't bullshit them. I will never call or go back again, totally disgusted!!!!!!!!\", u\"They have good burgers and brunch! Usually for dinner there's a 30min wait... the homemade ketchup is amazing!!!!!\", u\"Its important that you know that i live in this neighborhood now. I'm very happy about this because i have access to superb and cool vibe brunch places like Oxcart, and everything is super close by so i can walk to it. \\n\\nOxcart is great, not very big, and also doesn't take reservations. I'm relatively new to this brunch thing but I'm getting accustomed to these places not doing reservations. Its fine, we have been good at timing it and getting there with only a few minutes of wait time. What i have not been good at... was choosing better food than my wife. Every time we've gone out she's managed to get better food than me. Like when we went here she got the Oxcart skillet, which was noticeably better than my corned beef hash, which was quite good, but not on the same level of their skillet. I wanna go back and try out the fish and chips... but also go back and get my own skillet! I'm gong back asap. Obviously.\", u'This restaurant offers many traditional and good dishes- burgers, fish and chips.\\nThe food was very good. I had the good boy burger, it was huge, filled with  lots of delicious and fresh ingredients.\\nThe burgers were unique and inspiring. Everything was great and all the portions were generous.\\nThe people who work here are very friendly and treated all customers fairly.', u'I\\'ll start by saying that I\\'ve gone here for years and this place has been awesome. But the last year it has really gone bad. I use to come here for brunch all the time, their bloody Mary\\'s are amazing. My friend and I would down plenty and grab a great burger.\\n\\nLast time I went for brunch, we waited 1hr for our food and the order was wrong, and cold. Waitress was rude, she never said they had trouble in the kitchen and never came by our table to check on our drinks or anything. I called it a fluke although my friend who lives closer to ox Cart did mention it was the third time it happened to him.\\n\\nToday I returned because my family was in town and they mentioned they wanted a good burger, \"The Alamo\" was the first thing that came to mind (one of their burgers). They had only the lunch menu, understandable so we ordered a small burger. My fam was served hockey pucks :( I mean one thing is medium well but seriously the driest meat ever. They are elderly didn\\'t say a word but I saw it in their faces. Personally, I had a dry turkey burger that I could tell was cooked in a skilled that had just fried/cooked fish, b|c turkey shouldn\\'t taste like fish.\\n\\nOverall today the service WAS AMAZING, blonde dude with a cool accent served us and he was SUPER attentive. So at least they are in the right direction. But as a patron/regular, super disappointing. I hope they get back to the old school OX Cart', u\"Okay, I am an advocate for local business and try to support all of them but what I experienced yesterday from Oxcart left a very bad taste in my mouth. When we arrived the place was packed which is typical for the place and usually means that the food is good. We were given a table by the door and decided that in lieu of eating in we would take the food to go....big mistake.\\n\\nWe proceeded to wait over 40 minutes for fish with chips and a burger! The credit card machine wasn't working but I couldn't hold that against the business. We left sort of happy only to arrive home to face the most miserable effort of making fish and chips that I have EVER tasted. Fries were hard and not flavourful. The fish batter was thick, oily, and hard. I literally had to take it off because the first few bites that I had were all batter (see picture). Once I removed the batter the amount of fish that was exposed was so small I could not call it an order! \\n\\nThe one thing that I do like here is the desert so I guess I will consider continuing to stop by to get that to go as it typically doesn't take the 40 minutes this mess took.\", u\"This is one SOLID burger joint. Being close to my house, this is one of my favorite spots to go to for a burger. Their service is awesome! Servers are quick to take your order and bring your food, and check up on you once during the meal to make sure everything is great. \\n\\nThere are a few appetizers - the chicken liver moose is a must get! It is very rich in flavor and is always served with soft warm bread as opposed to some places that serve it on crisp crackers. It comes with a small side of jam and a few cornichons. \\n\\nThey have about 6 burgers, plus possibly a special depending on the day. Their meat is always very juicy and the toppings are always fresh. They serve their burgers with their signature smoked ketchup so if you are not a fan, ask for a side of regular ketchup. Their ox-less burger is a great vegetarian option - which is one of the best veggie burgers I've ever tasted. \\n\\nFor those not wanting a burger, they have a decent entree menu as well. They also have some home made treats for dessert. There is a full bar with daily cocktail specials and about three or four beers on tap plus ~10 bottled beers.\\n\\nIf you're looking for quality burgers, I highly recommend coming here. Will be posting a few pics of my meal.\"], u'17.The Brooklyn Tree': [u\"I came in on a whim because I was really hungry and needed something close by, and The Brooklyn Tree didn't disappoint. \\n\\nThe burger on English muffin was very good, but I just need to Yelp about these mashed potatoes. They were so creamy, flavorful, and perfectly seasoned with a little bit of spice. I'd come back just for these!\", u\"We stopped here for lunch and I really liked that while the menu wasn't extensive they offer a good variety of options. \\n\\nWhen you walk in you quickly realize that it's just a small shop with good vibes and good food. \\n\\nI decided to try the veggie loaf sandwich with fries. The veggie loaf is really tasty it comes on a ciabatta roll with gruyere cheese and house pickles. I enjoyed how well all the flavors blended together. And the addition of the red pepper glaze was a nice touch. The fries were standard - but they came out hot. I'd definitely order it again.\\n\\nTip! Make sure to take a picture under the Brookyn artwork on the wall!\", u'This small spot is great! \\n\\nI just discovered it, and I will definitely be eating here again.\\n\\nI met with the owner/ chef who was extremely nice and you could tell he was passionate about his creations and food.  \\n\\nThe environment is really chill and laid back, but best of all the whole restaurant was VERY clean and tidy. Again, shows that the owner cares.\\n\\nI ended up ordering the Beet Burger with sweet potato fries and was not disappointed! So much flavor with such simple and fresh ingredients. The portion sizes were just right too. I left feeling satiated but not over stuffed. \\n\\nI want to come back and try the Meatloaf and Cheese Puffs!', u\"Pretty good food and a lovely atmosphere. I'm glad they have so many veggie items that are far more interesting than the usual hummus or grilled veggie sandwich. I went with the panko crusted tofu shnitzel sandwich with seasoned fries - legit. They're pretty reasonably priced, including a side with the sandwich, which is always good.\", u\"I'm so sad that this is my last lunch in America... The food portion is big and we didn't really get to finish it. I also love the smashed potato and my friend loves the home- marinated vegetable. The waitress was really kind and piece is reasonable. We were two and spent less than 40 dollars.\", u'We came here after hours of dancing and were starving! I ordered the tofu schnitzel which was absolutely delicious!!! My friends ordered grilled cheese and burger and all raved about the food. The staff was super friendly and patient with us as we stood there trying to decide what to order as it was a first time for all of us. I would definitely go back :)', u\"Let me start off by saying that Brooklyn tree is legit. Located right off the montrose Ave stop. When you walk in - it's a got a cozy and clean vibe with some head bumping music (in a good way music). \\n\\nI was able to speak to the owner that day and recommended the grass fed burger with fries. Had to also add in a Vietnamese iced . \\n\\nVietnamese iced coffee - I knew it would be legit because I saw they had the correct Vietnamese condensed milk and using cafe du monde. Definitely was doing it right. The finished product was ON POINT. Highly recommend.\\n\\ngrass fed burger - words can't describe it. I know it's just a burger but the flavor and toppings....legit. \\nThey are also being unique as they use english muffins as their buns and the aged white cheddar - spectacular. Holy moly good. Highly recommend.\\nSide - frenchfries - they were made to order. Crispy and with the sea salt. Really good.\\n\\nCheese puffs - man oh man. Just try it. Don't know what to say but just try it. \\n\\nOkay - so u can see that the food is on point - but what really sets the place apart? Service. Period. It's not a sit down restaurant with fancy waiters but the staff makes sure to come around to each table and asking how the food is and how their day was going. How can you beat that? You don't see many places that come out from behind the register to see how everything is. This puts them over the top and differentiates them even more. \\n\\nFrom being a Manhattan guy - coming out to Brooklyn isn't common but with this spot - Will be back again on the regular. Period.\", u\"My experience was just average. The burger wasn't spectacular. The English muffin doesn't complement the burger or sauce at all--it's actually quite bitter tasting. I wish I ordered the Mac and cheese that most people raves about in previous reviews. I will most likely return to try that.\", u'Such great food. Delicious sandwiches!\\nThe delivery is insanely quick which is not normally the case in new york. \\nTheir burger is amazing. Its the best burger in the area. It comes with a generous side of fries too. \\nAlso tried they cheese puffs which were good. They are soft and fluffy and come with a dressing on the side.\\nThe schnitzel sandwich is great and my favorite it the veggie sandwich', u'Great Food, its fresh and healthy! Quick delivery These guys always handle business stat!! Mmm mmm Yum!', u'Nice takeout! Very simple place in itself, but tasty food and polite service. Tasty salads comes with the meat as well \\nI walked out of there full :-)', u'The best! I would eat here every day! That grass Fed burger is good  A.F.!!  It really does taste better than the usual burger. Good job guys', u'good clean food with nice people working beside the counter', u'Kale & quinoa salad is great. The schnitzel sandwich is amazing. Nice staff. The perfect place for lunch and dinner', u'The chicken schnitzel sandwiches and platters are must , along with the sides like sweet potatoes fries.  The ambience is pretty good with a great emphasis on eco-friendly disposal system.', u\"My daughter polished the grass fed burger with fries. I had half of my meatloaf sandwich with potato fries. Soooo good. The rest I took home. She also had vanilla shake. Service is excellent. Food is always awesome. Didn't have time to take pics. We gobbled them right away.\", u\"The food is luxuriously simple, well crafted, refined enough to be comfort food, all served in a laid back environment. The salads are so much more than they seem. \\n\\nCan't wait to return.\", u'Rude staff i made an order on seamless. I called nobody know where my food was, the person who answer the phone gave me attitude and hang up on me. My first call they said food was on the way, half hour after they dont know. Stay away from this unprofessional business', u'Excellent spot for a semi-quick bite. i say semi-quick bc it\\'s not a deli-type \"make me a sandwich, i gotta run\", and it\\'s certainly not a formal sit-down restaurant. I live off the Montrose L stop so before i head home, I submit a pickup order and it\\'s always there waiting for me no more than 20 mins later. the ppl who work there are super friendly.  The Garbanzo Loaf and Tuna Confit are my go-to\\'s. Always consistent and delicious.  Their Tomato soup has the right amount of ricotta to thicken it up nicely and make it a great treat for the winter/colder weather.  And - no lie - their Kale Quinoa salad is the perfect side.', u\"A bit on the pricey side, nevertheless the grub was solid, healthy, full of flavor and most importantly very delicious.\\n\\nSo, if you're near the Montrose area of Bushwick Brooklyn, and are in the mood for a quick bite, The Brooklyn Tree is well worth a try.\"], u'116.Sea Wolf': [u\"Brunch at Sea Wolf was one of the better decisions I made a couple weeks ago. I was hungover, hungry, and craving something different and I certainly wasn't disappointed.\\n\\nI started by ordering a fish bowl, which was a nice fruity drink that came in a ceramic shark glass. So nice that I ordered it twice, actually. For my meal I chose the Devil's Mess and it was the perfect blend of seafood and eggs, served up by a very handsome waiter. \\n\\nSpeaking of the handsome waiter, we had lovely conversation, and it was clear that he was flirting with me especially after he wanted to do a tequila shot with me. I left him my number and he never called me! Why didn't you call me?!\\n\\nOtherwise lovely meal. I might have given it 5 stars if Prince Charming hadn't left me heartbroken...\", u'Tonight was my third bad experience at this restaurant, and although I might have held back in the past, this is where I draw the line and make a decision to not come back here. \\nFirst strike tonight was that a dish I ordered wasn\\'t available. When I ordered something else off the menu, a veggie burger, not only did it come out about thirty minutes later, but it was burnt beyond the state of being edible, with condiments on the side, for some reason. After sending the dish back, a manager approached the table and said, \"so there\\'s an issue with the veggie burger?\" I explained to him that this dish was burnt and when he asked if I wanted it replaced I said no, as it already took over thirty minutes and I do not wish to wait another thirty for the next one. His response to this was \"we are over capacity tonight\" \\nThis restaurant is located at prime real estate in Bushwick. It is in the midst of many bars and other restaurants and local hang out spots. I understand that Bushwick Open Studios is happening this weekend, which accounts for a larger amount of clientele. However, BOS happens every year, and given the location of this restaurant, the management should be used to a large rush of visitors by this point, especially on the weekends, regardless of a special event or any given Saturday. However useless and half assed this excuse might have been, it is also invalid. I understand that this is a sea food restaurant. A sea food restaurant that has chosen to expand its target audience to include vegan dishes on the menu. If that is the route you take, don\\'t half ass it. Don\\'t try to justify the fact that you burned someone\\'s dinner by saying that you are busy. If you do not think that your restaurant can accommodate for the other demographic of the neighborhood, don\\'t falsely advertise and then not deliver. Just take those items off the menu all together, trust me, it will save everyone, including the management, a lot of pain and headache. \\nI probably shouldn\\'t even have to mention that I left after my dinner consisting of French fries and a drink, still hungry and annoyed.', u\"I dropped by the outdoor area at Sea Wolf for a couple of drinks on a gentle evening (before heading over to House of Yes). Beer selection was fine. It's beer, so it was pretty much what I expected. I'm giving it a 4-stars just because I really liked the atmosphere there (both indoor and outdoor). It's across the street from some interesting street art, and the people walking by are also fun to watch. The service was great, too.\\n\\nI can't say much about their food, but from my informal (and arguably impolite) people/table/food watching, it looked pretty good. Folks seemed to really be enjoying this big tin seafood bowl thing.\", u\"Yum! Staff is on point with providing us with a free shot, as we were in a particularly fun and boozy mood on a Sunday for brunch. We already had 2 drinks before this, so you already know where this is going.\\n\\nSea Wolf is juxtaposed right beside many quintessential Bushwick spots. Art adorns the streets. The inside decor is very fun and quirky. \\n\\nFoodwise, I honestly don't think you have to limit yourself to foods found in the sea; they are good at pretty much all else. Their egg dishes and burgers all looked great, from what I saw at other tables.\\n\\n-- My friend had the Devil's Mess ($12), and it was huge and delicious; the perfect breakfast dish. It probably had 5 or more eggs in it.\\n-- The fried chicken that was served with the waffles ($13?) was seasoned well and a little spicy, so the flavors mingled perfectly.\\n\\nCome here for some food and fun, and be happy knowing it's not super crowded for brunch.\", u\"Located in Bushwick, Sea Wolf is a really interesting place. The area just seems vibrant and full of personality. Across the street, there are some really cool murals and street art that seem to just amplify Sea Wolf's position on the corner as somewhere you should check out. \\n\\nThe guys and I stopped by for a quick bite. Sea Wolf gives me the impression that it used to be a garage - the ceilings are super high. It's also well lit, and the service was great.\\n\\nThe guys and I sat at the bar and ordered oysters, which was really fresh. For my main, I ordered fish and chips. The fish was pretty big and not overwhelmingly battered to where i couldn't enjoy the fish. The overall ambiance here intrigues me and i'll definitely be back to check out the rest of the menu.\", u\"Great HH prices.  Good service. Good food for the price. Awesome place to chill, and catch up, or get your night started.\\n Enjoyed  the open for plan lay out, and the garage door walls that opened all the way up to the ceiling.  Great art around the way, but what do you expect you're in Williamsburg.  All in all a good dining experience will deffinetly  come back.\", u\"Although I've only been here during their happy hour, Sea Wolf is one of my favorite happy hours in Brooklyn (maybe NYC period). Ive never had to wait to be seated and the people who work here are very nice and the service is fast. I love the decor and how big and open this place is. When it's nice out being able to sit inside or have the garage doors open is awesome. \\nOkay back to this awesome happy hour that goes everyday from 4-7. $5 pain killers, dollar wings and oysters. There are some other options but those are my favorites. The pain killers are really good. Refreshing. The wings are hand cut so you get a flat and a leg. The oysters are fresh.\", u'I seriously love this place. Good fish and chips, yummy steam pot that can feed two people, daily specials are always fresh and well prepared.\\n\\nHappy hour is great with lots of drink and food options. \\n\\nThe bartenders and servers are friendly and remember you if you come by often.', u\"I do recommend you to come during happy hour between 4-7 for $1 Barcat oysters, $1 wings and $5 draft beers. \\n\\nEverything else on the menu seems to be overpriced for a small portion of food. $9 for fried zucchini? The host and servers were soulless. One waitress was walking like she had a stick up her rear. The attitude is through the roof here. \\n\\nWell, I'll just come back for oysters and beer!\", u\"This place is simply awesome! Came here on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. It's always great to go to a place that doesn't feel like a bland restaurant experience The Sea Wolf creates an atmosphere that transforms the attendee from New York to some tropical island... friendly staff, great drinks and delicious food cooked to perfection. \\nGreat for brunch/lunch.\", u\"This place just draws you in. I was walking by heard music  and saw crowd of people  eating. It just looked like a place I needed to  try. The service  was excellent and decor was on point. I had a pain killer frozen drink and Friday fish fry. Everything  was good but the fish, it just didn't do it for. I would definitely go back to try brunch.\", u'Cool restaurant with a friendly staff. We got the fish and chips and chorizo tacos. Super good! Fun place to eat at- inside or outdoor seating.', u\"This place has an amazing atmosphere, good music and surrounded by beautiful art, this is honestly what brought us here and the fact that it was full. The fish and chips were amazing hands down best I've ever had, the fries were very good and the fish was perfectly fried. We also ordered 2 Pain Killers which is their signature frozen drink, it's pineapple based and very yummy! My mom ordered the burger and it was cooked to perfection, just wish it came with a side of fries.\", u\"Went for brunch. Thought the Alaskan eggs Benedict was delicious. The hollandaise was on point. Definitely worth a try. The clam chowder was excellent. Bloody Mary's and mimosas are buy 1 get the second half off, so that was a good deal. Also ordered the charred octopus, which was fresh but barely had any octopus in the dish. It was also covered with tons of martini olive slices. A bit too overpowering for me. \\n\\nWould love to come back for their happy hour.\", u'Great service, good selection of beers on tap, amazing lobster roll.    :)\\nAll thumbs up !!!', u'This is the second restaurant at this location. Lorenzo\\'s before this didn\\'t do well and I\\'m not sure why. It\\'s an amazing space, corner location with super high ceilings covered in bricks, tons of cool art and knick knacks on the walls...I can go on.\\n\\nI came for brunch back in the summer and had their chicken sandwich and several \"painkillers\" which is their delicious signature drink - highly recommended. Their brunch was strange because they had almost nothing on their menu but oysters and some sandwiches. Service was just OK. This place is definitely all ambiance.', u\"When I hear Bushwick I think of hipsters, wanna bes  starving artist and crazy people who left west bubble fk to live like sardines and get on a packed L train with a unicycle (definitely witnessed that). I'm not familiar with the area but the pictures looked really good so I decided to try it. The atmosphere is really nice. There is inside and outside seating with lots of murals in the area. There wasn't no service besides being asked what to eat honestly. All of the servers seemed to be rather laid back and nonchalant so I'm guessing they get paid hourly. Now the food was pretty good.The seafood was very fresh. What's the reason for the rating? The price you pay for the food the portions are small as hell. A tiny lobster roll cost $26 and does not even include fries. Forget about a doggy bag you won't even need it. I don't complain about prices bc that's not how capitalism works but I was still hungry after paying $141 worth of food.\", u\"One of the first places I tried in Bushwick, Sea Wolf really draws you in with its high ceilings, ecelctic, flotsam jetsam interior, and quantity of outdoor seating.  It's also in a really vibrant area of Bushwick, which boasts a staggering density of public art murals and is next to a lot of buzzy bars and nightlife spots.  So, it's no surprise that it continues to be a spot where I bring friends that are visiting, usually for a few drinks and small bites.  \\n\\nAs others have mentioned, the frozen painkiller is a real highlight - I could probably down ten of those, brainfreeze and all, but they also have some other solid cocktail and draft options if you're more of a beer drinker.  Food-wise, I've tried the watermelon, feta, and arugula salad (stellar), bluefish dip (okay - not as spreadable as I would have liked), and the lobster corndog (good).  I'll have to try the fish and chips and the brunch sometime. \\n\\nHonestly, they could be serving seawater and I'd probably still stop in for a glass - it's such a welcoming spot.\", u'Randomly stopped in on a Wednesday afternoon because I didn\\'t want Artichoke Basille\\'s, which my friend made us drive from Flatbush to get. However, I immediately became excited once I saw Sea Wolf because I knew there\\'d be at least fish and chips for me to eat, which I was in the mood for. (I always want seafood.)\\n\\nAnyhow, we enter the restaurant and stand at the door where the reservation computer thingy ma-jiggy machine is--in a failed attempt to get recognized and seated. It wasn\\'t crowded so we thought \\'someone will be over soon\\'. My smart friend decides that we just walk in since we\\'d been there for about 2-3 minutes at this point. We walk up to the bar; there\\'s a guy there, but he doesn\\'t acknowledge us. Then there\\'s another man who is walking back and forth clearing tables and serving food who also doesn\\'t acknowledge us. Then there\\'s a big guy getting ready to pour some water who we walk up to and ask \"can we just sit anywhere we\\'d like?\" and then he suggests 2 tables we can sit at.\\n\\nFinally, we\\'re seated and ready to order, but there are no menus. Five minutes pass by--still no menus nor any water. At this point, we were cold (all the restaurant shutters were up) and ready to get back in my car and bump the heat! The big guy returns and hands us two menus. We order very quickly as to avoid waiting a long time for someone to remember our existence. \\n\\nNoticing that we were looking for a seat near the rear kitchen to avoid the cold breeze, a nice man with shoulder-length wavy, dark hair (who I am guessing was a manager), came over and asked if we needed anything. When we told him that we wanted to change our seating because we were super cold, he responded by closing the restaurant/garage shutters, which made a world of difference (and was so kind).\\n\\nFood: I ordered the \"devil\\'s mess\": shrimp, cheddar, red peppers, onion, jalapeno, baby spinach, mushrooms, scrambled eggs, and topped with guac. My friend ordered the deviled eggs and fries. My expectations weren\\'t set high for my dish because I don\\'t like that many things in my scrambled eggs, but I wanted to live on the edge. I was so glad I ordered it though because it blew my mind. It was very tasty and the guac wasn\\'t listed on the menu as part of the dish so that was a pleasant surprise! The deviled eggs were nicely whipped and seasoned. The fries weren\\'t to die for, but I enjoyed the greasiness nonetheless.\\n\\nSea Wolf definitely had potential to be 4, or even 5, stars but the service sucked. The restaurant had no more than 10 people dining when my friend and I got there (and 10 is pushing it!). I couldn\\'t tell you what the excuse was for the poor service nor, like a former reviewer, said the \"soulless\" people.', u'This is a big place by NYC standards.  Plenty of tables including several tables outside.  Music was something modern, not very loud.  Decor is rustic with nautical elements. Only a block from the Jefferson Street stop on the L train.\\n\\nStopped in for a quick cocktail - saw it by chance.  When the place I was heading to was not open, I circled back and hit the bar.  The kitchen closes between 3:30 and 4:00 so I did not try the food. Several interesting cocktails on the list.  Bartender was professional and friendly.\\n\\nOut of the way for me but worth a try if you are in Brooklyn.'], u'44.Brooke Street Wings': [u\"saw a friend post this restaurant on fb & decided to give it a try since its in the neighborhood. one word amazing! i ordered the 4 cheese mac & bed stuy wings .. soo gooooood\\n \\nalso met the owner, such a nice guy! can't wait to eat here again so goood\", u'I can attest that the wings are beyond reproach. They are amazing and I will put them up against anything I have had in the 5 boroughs. \\n\\nThe burger I had tonight was fantastic. I had a Kobe beef burger on a pretzel bun with bacon and aged cheddar. The flavor was outstanding and I recommend you take a trip down to 773 Lounge to pick up what Brooke Street Wings is putting down.', u\"The wings themselves are good. The flavors are great but it does have a flaw in my opinion. I'd say if the wings were a little cheaper they would be doing so much better in business. 6 wings for $10 ($11 on another flavor(s)) is to much. If the wings were around the $8 or so I'd buy them regularly. The owners would have to understand that they aren't the only wing joint with alcohol, b-dubs is packed all the time when I go. Anyways to finalize my review, the staff is friendly and food is great. I'm coming back but not to much. I would definitely recommend this joint to a friend.\", u'As everyone said the food is just excellent, and the price is very comfortable too, better than in any other places similar to this. Tasty food and any sports you want to watch( what could be better?)\\nSo I liked pretty much everything. Nice place!', u\"So after hearing about this place for a few weeks I decided to stop in with my son and boyfriend. Since the place just opened it was quiet. It was very clean and had good feel to it. The cook automatically greeted us and was very helpful and friendly he gave a detailed breakdown of the food served which helped make it easier. Though it isn't 100% kid friendly the cook definitely helped with providing my son with his chicken tenders and fries. I tried the BK Magic wings and the four cheese mac and my guest had the burger and mac combo with a side of fries. I must say the wings were amazing the mac and cheese tasted very rich. My guests also said that their meals were very tasty overall we had a amazing experience I look forward to visiting again.\", u\"Brooke Street Wings are among the best I've had in the city!  We ordered the lemon wings, bourbon wings, truffle mac and cheese, and kale caesar salad.  Everything was delicious, well portioned and well priced.  We met the owner as well -- you can tell how passionate he is about his food and how much he cares about everyone who comes to eat there.  Definitely worth the trip!!!\", u\"Mac and cheese is a go and the wings try the bam pepper impress can't forget the burger\", u\"The wings here are great. The bourbon wings are downright phenomenal, deliciously sweet with just a hint of savor. On top of that the staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is dope. And you get all of the sports bar amenities you like. Awesome wings, darts, good beer and NBA playoffs. It's awesome.\", u'Walked in here and wanted to make an order for something to eat and the lady told me no the kitchen was closed today, try coming back tomorrow...', u\"Amazing wing spot. The BAM lemon pepper wings were super on point. I've been looking for a good neighborhood wing spot for years and this was definitely worth the wait. Service was also excellent and very attentive. We came to watch a game and had an excellent experience as they had plenty of seating and multiple TV's. Highly recommend!\", u'Went here last night.  We really liked it.  Got the wings in bbq and bourbon, both great.  Especially liked the bourbon.  The burger was amazing soft kobe beef with crispy shoestring fries.  Would highly recommend this place.  Hope they get delivery soon.', u\"My husband and I were looking for a local spot to grab a quick bite and a few drinks. I remembered driving past this place and made a mental note to stop in. I'm glad we did. We ordered the Brooklyn Buffalo wings and 4 Cheese Mac. Everything was great. The wings were crispy, yet saucy and spicy. The Mac was just cheesy enough and flavorful. Forgot to take a picture of the food, it was so good; we ate it up so quick. We will certainly come back! I'm looking forward to trying some other wing flavors.\", u\"These wings are so amazingly good! I have gone here every night for a week because I can't get enough. The Brooke St. Team is amazing and accommodating, if you are in the mood for wings please go try the Buffalo or Bourbon!!!!\", u'I went there specifically to try the bourbon wings and was sadly informed that they were out. Got the regular wings instead and they were average. Too few wings for the price.', u'This place is located in Brooklyn. I live in Queens. I AM RETURNING TO THIS PLACE TOMORROW!. Darts and wings and a cool ass chef?! Brooke Street Wings is the tits', u\"Food was super flavorful and not ur normal back of the bar food. I had the truffle mac and cheese and wings and I literally scarfed it down because it was so good. The service was also good, the only reason I'm not giving five stars is because the wait was extremely long. Almost an hour. Hopefully because the food is super fresh and only one chef with time they will get a bit faster.\", u\"My lady referred this place to me through Instagram. We decided to stop by and at first we went past it because Brooke Street Wings is inside of a bar (drinks and wings... the concept works). We ordered the Truffle Mac n Cheese, Bed Stuy Bourbon wings (I'm from The Stuy so I set the bar high), and an order of Buffalo wings. The Truffle Mac n Cheese has a great smoke bbq flavor to it, the Bed Stuy Bourbon wings were gooooood, and the Buffalo wings were on point. We'll definitely be back.\", u'Love this place, Wonderful wings and extremely great and attentive service, Will definitely be back again!', u\"Got the Buffalo wings. They were delicious. I'm particular with the spiciness of my wings and these were great. They also had a really nice flavor, slightly different from your average Buffalo wing.\", u'Will definitely be returning. The food service was excellent. I really enjoyed my meal!! Thanks Brooke Street Wings!!! Keep up the good work!'], u'134.Pok\\xe9 Bowl': [u\"Delicious! Since I like salmon, I got the Salmon Lover's Bowl! Very filling for a decent price! I also got a mango green tea and it was a bit too sweet, but still very refreshing and good!\\n\\nThere were about 8 (maybe more) tables and plenty of seats. It was clean and chill.\\n\\nThe cashier and the rest of the staff were very friendly and helpful. \\n\\n5/5!\", u\"Their Poke is decent and the price is good for their proportions. It was my first time trying Poke here and it didn't stand out to me. You can add a lot of different unlimited toppings for your bowl. They have a combo special where you can get a medium drink and 1 protein choice for $10.95. The Yakult drink I ordered didn't taste very good to me. \\n\\nI think there are better and more authentic Poke places in NYC. Poke Bowl does its job of providing a nearby poke option in the Sunset Park neighborhood. Also, I think their name is a little confusing - Poke Bowl is inside Snow & Cream which serves rolled Thai ice cream, bubble tea, shaved ice and egg waffles. \\n\\nDuring the summer, you can eat and chill outside in their backyard.\", u\"I cannot agree more with Linda C. Good portion but not good quality. Their salmon wasn't fresh on both occasions. Their rice. Omg, don't get me started. It's not seasoned nor was it sushi rice. And it was freaking steaming. I honestly don't see how that's a good combo. Even the sauce they use can't mask it all. \\n\\nBut in all honesty, come if you're hungry cause you can put many toppings on it. But that's the only pro I see here. Even the staff members were a bit rude/annoyed when my bf couldn't decide what to put on it.\", u\"When Poke Bowl was introduced inside the franchise called Snow n' Cream, I was never interested in coming here. I always thought, it can't be that good, especially not compared to the many places in the city. I had a bad experience once in the city and I guess that made me hesitant to come give this place a try BUT my friends always comes here for lunch, and I finally caved in to give it a try during lunch time with my friends and I'm pleasantly surprised how good it was. \\n\\nCame here at 1pm on a Thursday and thank god for short lines and available seating! They have indoor and outdoor seating. \\n\\n1) You get to choose your bowl to be either rice (offers brown rice) or salad or a burrito. \\n2) Then you get to choose a protein of your own. If you want to add more than one protein to your bowl, there will be an extra cost. You get to choose from a variety of choices such as salmon, spicy salmon, shrimp, chicken, octopus, etc. \\n3) Choose your greens and veggies! I am a huge lover of anything green, so this is probably my favorite part. I probably get almost everything they have to offer from tomatoes, cilantro, green onion, mushroom, corn, avocado, etc.\\n4) Sauce. I only tried the special sauce which is basically spicy mayo to me. Pretty good. Not sure will I try other sauces or stick with what I know is good to me. \\n5) Toppings to choose from such as roasted seaweed, sesame, etc. \\n\\nI personally feel like the portion is good enough. Not small and not too big. If you want to be more full, I suggest getting the rice as an option rather than the salad. They also have a good deal, $11.50 for a bowl and a medium sized drink of your choice! Definitely will be coming back here again and hopefully it will still be just as good as my first experience.\", u\"Super happy that I can get poke bowls in my neighborhood now! Ingredients are so fresh here, fish are nicely cut, and sauces were on point! My first poke bowl here was back in last December when they first launched it and had their first promotion. I was really impressed with the quality and generous portions. I am pleased to let you know that this still remains true! Poke Rice Bowl, Poke Burrito, or Poke Salad, take your pick!\\n \\nI went in big with 3 proteins poke rice bowl option (of course!) - Ahi Tuna, Salmon, and Octopus. Toppings and Mix-In's are unlimited - so I went with avocado, green onions, cucumber, masago, seaweed salad, kale greens, cherry tomatoes and topping it off with roasted seaweed. For the sauce, I went with their special house Poke sauce. Everything was mixed in well perfectly and it was delicious! By the way, this poke bowl was a large portion but I finished it by myself happily to my very last bite! \\n\\nIt is always great to see that this is an experiment turn success! I will be back!\", u'Part of Snow and Cream.  Had a better experience this time. Went at 7:45pm for dinner and no line.   We created our own poke bowl combos which came with any medium drinks. Quick service.  Ingredients were fresh. This is the closest place in Brooklyn for a decent poke and affordable price.  Recommended and definitely go back.', u\"I love coming to this Pokebowl spot. It's so worth it to the pokebowls I go to in the city. You can get as much toppings as you want on your bowl. In the city things like avocado or seaweed toppings cost extra. Here they don't and its wonderful!! My bowl is always pack! I also love how they do combos pokebowl (1protein) with your choice of drink. Since I don't eat raw fish. It's worth it for me! I always get shrimp protein and a drink. The store also has desserts and hong kong waffles!\", u\"Service and food are great here. Why pay an extra $.50 to $1.50 for avocado when you can get it for no extra cost here! They also bave a combo where you can get a sushi burrito or poke bowl with one protein and a cold medium  drink for $10.95! That means you're paying only $2 extra for a drink, which is a good bargain. Great selection of ingredients to choose from. They also have drinks and pouches, you'll have to ask them about it when ordering a drink (I'm not sure if they charge extra for that). Good for lunch and there are also bubble waffles, shaved ice and other desserts to try when you're there. Will definitely come back again.\", u'For less than $13 a person you get a big bowl or burrito filled with fresh deliciousness (2 proteins) and any medium drink.  The sign outside says the combo (includes medium drink) is for 1 protein which was a bit confusing. Turns out that you can get a combo for any # of proteins and they just add around 2 bucks which is great for the type of drinks you can get.  We got bubble milk tea with red bean (sooo good) and 3 iced green teas - apple, peach and mango.  All tasty and refreshing.  This place is worth a visit.', u\"Nothing special. I tried the pre-made salmon lover bowl. It was a bad combination of toppings. On top of that, the fish wasn't the best quality. I probably had 5 tiny cubes of salmon in my bowl. I mean I ordered salmon lover for a reason but I got half a bowl of inexpensive toppings. Only good thing I would say is the unlimited amount of toppings that can be put in the bowl if I were to made my own.\", u\"So glad I can get poke in this neighborhood now with poke bowl. The menu is simple and you can pick and choose what you want. I got 3 proteins ( cause I was feeling extra that day), salmon, spicy salmon and tuna. They actually pretty good portions of the fish and the chunks are huge. Then you can choose as many mix ins as you want. I chose seaweed salad, avocado, ginger, and should've added more but there were so many options. Then you get a choice of sauce. There are also a lot that you can choose from. I ended up getting the poke special which is essentially a spicy mayo. I don't know why but the woman who made my bowl literally drenched everything in the sauce so that took away from the favors of everything else in my bowl. However, it was still good and decent so I will def be back!\", u\"been here 2-3 times and their poke bowl never disappoints. took one of my girls here for a late night meal and she got the sushi burrito. she was in loveeeee. there's a lot of poke spots near my office area in the city, but i feel like the ingredients at this location is a lot fresher and more consistent. it does get a bit crowded to get a nice seat, but overall a nice hang out spot. and i like how they have drinks and other goodies there as well. didn't get to try their other stuff but definitely will next time.\", u'Love this idea.   Love this place. Love the food. Love the price. Ya think I like it?', u'This poke spot shares the same space as the dessert place. Poke was fresh and unlimited toppings. Would come back.', u'I really liked this place. Very fresh and healthy. Be careful the Poke Bowel is inside Snow & Cream.', u'There are many choices of ingredients you can choose in ur bowl. But those are raw fish so becareful if u cant eat any raw stuff. But is a nice place to hang out.', u'I LOVE this place! Opens late and they serve dessert with poke. My favorite about poke bowl is they serve mini octopus as a protein, hint many other poke spots offer octopus. And they give larger portions with unlimited toppings(including avacado!)', u\"My friends and I have been coming here since the day they opened and have made this our usual spot to meet up for dinner. They are always running some sort of special or promotion, so make sure you check their Facebook page!\\n\\nI have been here for the 20% off promotion, the $10.75 combo (still going on) and now they have a wheel you can spin and win a prize if you spend over $10 (Mon-Fri 2pm-7pm). \\n\\nThere have been an uproar craze with poke and I'm so glad they have a location in Brooklyn. This place is so good and you have so many different options. You're paying for either 1, 2 or 3 proteins and all the toppings are unlimited. The ingredients are always fresh and they're really generous too! The poke special sauce is a must get!\\n\\nIf you're not in the mood for poke, this place also have drinks and dessert! The drinks come in these super cute pouches now! Will definitely be coming back!\", u\"So I've wanted to eat here for 6 months, but didn't know anyone adventurous enough to try it out. So today, after our dr appointment little buddy boy and I tried it out. It was fantastic. I had the spicy tuna poke bowl with avocado edamame rice mango crab and sesame dressing. Fantastic and delicious. Buddy boy had chocolate ice cream and waffle balls. They also had rolled sheets of ice that looked awesome. The decor was fantastic and no one made me feel guilty for being this white dude that had no idea what was going on. The staff was super nice and explained the process to me. This is a very fun little place, and one of the best lunch places I have been to in a very long time. I'd give 6 stars if I could.\", u'So many poke places opening up in NY! But the most closest one is here in Brooklyn... nearby 8th ave N train. Only difference here   Is that you pay first compared to other poke places in the city where you order then pay last lol. Lots of toppings to choose from and decent pricing'], u'18.Harmony Tea House': [u'Awesome Hibiscus Fusion Tea !!!\\nReally comfy vibe here \\nDefinite recommended !!!\\nVery hard to find a store like this.', u'As someone from Taiwan, we drink bubble tea everyday. Harmony tea has high quality above average bubble tea shops. Tea was fresh brewed all the times and amazing tapioca!  Highly recommend this cute place in Williamsburg.', u'Best bubble tea in Williamsburg!  Bright and comfy seating, with wonderful service.', u\"Great bubble tea! Really nice environment! Very clean and friendly staff. I'll definitely be back. Looking forward to seeing what this place has in store for the future. 5 stars!!\", u'This is a wonderful tea house that selects tea from different countries of world base on their taste. Carefully mix with ingredients and to creative rich and colorful flavors. It may take a bit time to wait since the tea house ensure each cup of tea is fresh and in good condition. Great quality, friendly price, highly recommended.', u'Extra surprise for our 3 today! Excellent location, nice host and best taste of the milk tea!', u\"Setting is sweet and welcoming. Lovely and passionate owner has great knowledge in her products! They have a quality tea selection from great and healthy sources, including some I've never seen before. I literally can't wait to try them all. I'm only getting cold brewed coffee today but even the coffee is banging!!!!\", u'The host is so nice. The tea here is selected carefully with great taste. I had an really harmonious experience sitting here and talking with my friends.', u\"I was very surprised about the tea and bubble's quality. They certainly know how to make authentic bubble tea. It's probably the best bubble tea in New York City.\"], u'203.Fairfax': [u'Great little spot in Greenwich. \\n\\nNice tapas options and a great glass of wine/small plate special for only $20!\\n\\nMost importantly the service was really quite nice. Phillip was very very attentive, fun and very well educated on both the menu and the wine list. \\n\\nHe patiently explained to my novice self what the \"Orange\" wine was all about and even offered up a taste. Its a unique flavor and I happily ordered a glass. \\n\\nThis would be a great date spot.', u'We all have that one that got away. The one you had perfect, romantic nights with, the one you started prematurely imagining sun-filled brunches with, the one you thought would always be there for you. And then they leave.\\n\\nFor me, that was Perla, the previous Italian restaurant in the space before Stulman converted it to \"all day wine bar\" Fairfax. Understated leather chairs have been swapped out for luxe couches and mismatched easy chairs, and there\\'s more cacti and quirky artifacts out then you can shake a stick at. The pasta-heavy menu has changed to a New York modern grab bag-- steak tartare! arctic char! chocolate tar(t)!\\n\\nHowever, what Fairfax kept was the flattering lighting, the 28-year-olds with perfect skin, and the sense that you\\'re exactly where you\\'re supposed to be, so I\\'ll probably stick around.\\n\\nI came in just after 8 to meet a friend after going down the wrong street three times (damn you, confusing West Village triangle). There were a couple of options available, and we opted for the cozy blue velvet chairs next to a window. We were worried it would be awkward with two other people sharing our table, but it\\'s pleasantly loud enough that you don\\'t accidentally interact with strangers.\\n\\nI snacked too much at work and my friend drank too much at work, so I went for wine while my friend went for food. The by-the-glass list is relatively short for a wine bar (maybe 7 offerings), but we can\\'t all be Terroir. I went for their Gruner Veltliner ($15) after a brief consultation with our server. My friend opted for the pasta with shrimp ($25).\\n\\nMy wine came out in 5-10 minutes and was crisp and dry. My friend\\'s pasta took at least 20. She reported it good, though it was a little oversauced. We spent a delightful hour or two here. Our server checked in on us but didn\\'t try to rush us out. The ambiance is still top notch-- the room is buzzing with good-looking young adults but it\\'s not too deafening or hectic. The bathrooms are very clean and have my favorite Malin+Goetz rum soap.\\n\\nI think this place\\'s opening was overhyped. I can see this being a convenient spot during the day, and I feel interested in it as a brunch spot. But it is quite expensive, and the whole casual living room shtick makes the experience feel unorganized and not as special.\\n\\nMostly, I just miss Perla. But if I want to feel like one of the beautiful people, I would consider paying the price for it again.', u\"Food is expensive for the portion sizes. \\n\\nCheese was good but they didn't make it...\\n\\nArctic char was cold when it came out. Bland too. \\n\\nWine was good but again it's not like they made it. \\n\\nDecor is better than la perla days but it's super loud in here. I don't want to have to shout at the person next to me. Can't they do something about the sound? Design oversight.\", u\"Tryin' to keep this quiet, but obviously doing a poor job by broadcasting its greatness to the ENTIRE WORLD.\\n\\nYou've gotta come here for brunch. Skip the loud, frenetic nighttime scene and cozy on up to the rustic tables and chairs at this apartment-style new cafe. \\n\\nMust get:\\n - the egg and soldiers: cheesy bread dipped in perfectly-poached eggs. Completely heavenly. Hungry just thinking about it!\\n- the raspberry almond crumb cake: like a linzer cookie but fresher and easier to eat (no powdered sugar!)\\n\\n5 stars!!!!!!!!\", u\"Perla Cafe just closed and reopened as this place, an all day cafe from the same owners.\\n\\nWhile they have a regular menu of food that you can make a meal out of, and full service, it has more of the cafe feel with communal tables and some smaller tables with mismatched seats.\\n\\nThe food is great like at all of Gabriel Stulman's restaurants, including the Cubano ($14) and the Spaghetti ($18).\\n\\nIf I'm ever around here before 11, I'd definitely come in to try the breakfast.\", u'Excellent cuisine and customer service! \\n\\nI ordered the white bean hummus which tasted just as delicious on its own as it did with the carefully toasted pita bread. I have to say, I was not expecting cauliflower and hummus to go together and was pleasantly surprised. I also tried the Da Mar prosecco which had a lovely sweet aftertaste!', u\"Great brunch spot. Extremely mellow, chill vibe, with good music playing. Menu has the normal brunch menu, avocado toast, bacon and egg dishes, yogurts, but got to try all 3 and all 3 were exceptional. I'd come here more for the vibe than the actual food. But the food is definitely very good.\", u'Great place to grab a glass of wine and a small plate. Friendly staff and cozy atmosphere.', u\"The revamped Perla. And of course, like all things Stulman, it slays! His restaurants are one of my favorite things about living in the WV. \\nCame in the AM for late breakfast and to do some work. More places like this need to exist. \\nChill vibe. Communal tables. Bar seating. Tables with comfy chairs. Felt like cafes I've been to in Stockholm or Copenhagen. A place you can have coffee or a glass of wine. A pastry or steak tartare. Anytime of the day. \\nHad the simple toast with pluots, rosemary and sour cream. Savory deliciousness. \\nGreat Stumptown coffee. Laid back service. (in a good way). \\nThere's nothing negative to say about this place. \\nAnd glad the same cool hip-hop art is still there!\", u'So vibey. The place looks and feels like the ideal West village apartment. The food is incredible and the service is very attentive. Highly recommend the burrata and cubano. This is the type of place where you can post up with your date on a soft brown leather couch.', u'Love love love it here. I\\'ve been three times in the past two weeks - for early-ish drinks, a boozey dinner, and lunch. And I\\'ll be returning on Friday for dinner. It\\'s a very innovative model, and a vibe that can\\'t be beaten. Beautifully and comfortably decorated. Staff is all extremely nice, has just the right touch. I\\'ve sat all over, and each experience offers something slightly different. Daytime feels more laid-back. On a Friday night, it felt a little \"scene-y\"; not a bad thing, but I prefer the daytime/week night evenings when it\\'s a little bit more chill.', u'We came to this place a lot when it was Perla but Fair Fax is the new and improved version.  Had few low key drinks and appetizers with friends. Portions are small but super delicious. We ordered the Burrata (amazing), spaghetti (also amazing) and the steak tartare (super amazing). The tartare is very delicious and probably my favourite out of the things we ordered. Will definitely be a regular here', u'Came in here solo to pregame a date and I must say I am impressed!! The bartenders are extremely helpful and the lighting is quite dim yet it somehow still feels bright. The couple next to me just got this hummus dish that looks incredible 5 stars', u'Nice snacks, solid all day menu. Very casual atmosphere with solidly crafted food. Good spot!', u'Really delicious food. As what seems to be par for the course at the all-day cafes that seem to be the new trend, we left hungry. Nevertheless, the plate-and-glass special during happy hour (before 7) was a steal. Very nice low-key vibe make it great for a date, but perhaps a bit too casual for anything more formal. Again, really delicious food.'], u'163.KarV\\xe9r Brasserie & Bakery Caf\\xe9': [u\"I'm a fan when it comes to their bakery department, exquisite and delicious. I originally wanted to give 3 stars, but the decor deserve this place to be visited. The food presentation is on point. We've spent $160 per a couple, and we've expected a little more OMG This is soooo good!! remark. We did love the escargot, three cheese croque and the KarVer pineapple dessert. \\n\\nWhat I absolutely disliked is my steak being cold, bartender who should try to master drinks outside of the KarVer menu, and the very slow service. There was one waiter going around all tables, but plenty of busboys and managers. \\n\\nI'm def. coming back to try other things on the menu but dear managers at $80 a person for dinner, let's try a little harder. Good luck and see you soon!\\n\\nPS When people are dining, there is absolutely no need to give them laser stares, it makes your patrons uncomfortable :P\", u\"God knows we need more cute coffee places with outdoor seating here in south Brooklyn, hence I am really rooting for this newly opened cafe. KarV\\xe9r definitely nails the outdoor seating but needs some improvement on the rest.\\nThis place has a ton of tables and a lovely view of Sheepshead Bay along with some trees and greenery. It's great to be able to grab a coffee and sit outside, while taking advantage of their free wifi. Coffee was decent but pricey and service was rather slow. It looks like they are still training staff because it took them a while to figure out how to steam almond milk for my latte. I also tried their flourless chocolate cake and it was way too dense and not especially fresh. This place definitely has potential but they need to step up their game when it comes to coffee, pastries and service especially at the high prices they are charging. \\n\\nOn the bright side they carry a large variety of gourmet packaged items amongst which I found my favorite Brooklyn made Nunu chocolates. Definite brownie points for that! I will definitely give them another shot because it looks like they have some interesting lunch items and because I'm a sucker for nice outdoor seating on a warm sunny day.\", u\"Came here for a quick breakfast....I was pleasantly surprised, it was a bit pricey but def worth it...I had chia seeds parfait, zucchini muffin and nitro cold brew. The coffee was nothing special but the parfait and muffin is what will get me to come back. \\n\\n2 of my girlfriends had the salmon tartine with an americano coffee; salmon tartine was delicious but the coffee they can forego.\\n\\nWhat was annoying about the barista was he kept serving people after us and especially when I asked 5 times when can we get our coffee. I believe he was overwhelmed being that it's a new spot and there were loads of people, so not angry about that just annoyed. \\n\\nUpside: cute little cafe with outdoors.\\n\\nDownside: street parking which means parking is hard to find. \\n\\nOverall, I'd come back again.\", u'Stopped by the bakery, the ambiance is lovely. The coffee was very good and there was a small selection of desserts. Tried a Croque Monsiur which was pretty good. Very friendly baristas and a nice selection of truffles and chocolates.\\n\\nHope to see a wider selection of desserts soon and looking forward to them opening for weekend brunch.', u\"It's a great place to experience something different in Sheepshead Bay.  Finally this neighborhood got a little taste of French cuisine.\", u'Great coffee! However, a very unprofessional staff. Got there at 7:30, they were closed. Even though their website and their door sign say they close at 8:00. It happened twice. Not cool!', u\"Because of the location , and the interior design I though the place will be good , but once we saw the menu - only eggs and sandwich's until 5pm and nothing more - and once we tried those eggs and sandwich's we realized that this place is horrible. \\nThe bread was dried as it was not fresh, the avocado toast was WAY too salty , and it literally took the waiter to bring us coffee 15 minutes and food another 15-20 minutes ... horrible ! Such a waste.\", u'Love the ambiance of the bakery and restaurant! Bakery has fresh (unique) pastries that are to die for and restaurant provides quality food with generous portions for reasonable prices! Not to mention the restaurant space is GORGEOUS! \\n\\nWent with a big group for dinner & below is what we ordered. Every dish was bursting with flavor and you could taste the freshness.\\n\\nApps:\\nSpreads & Grilled Breads\\nCheese Sampling\\nSeafood Sampling - Avocado Crab Parfait is so good!\\nFrench Onion Soup - Could eat this everyday!\\nBroiled Escargots - if you love garlic & butter - you\\'ll love this dish!\\n\\nEntree:\\nSteak Frites - Great flavor grilled to perfection!\\n\"Spaghetti\" Ratatouille - generous portion! \\nBouillabaisse - FRESH SEAFOOD that you can taste\\n\\nYou have to keep in mind that this place just opened. They are working out the kinks (which is normal for a new restaurant) but I expect great things in the future!', u'Uck, wasted $120.00; L.I. Beer and North Folk Rose wine was good, very good, small breads on table tasted fresh, then waiter served olive oil for breads but when I ask for ground fresh pepper, he did not know what to do with it LOL. So I explain to him, please sprinkle ground pepper on top of olive oil. Hmm, small mussels where served before salad., Server forgot where their Mussels  come from, they where served with fresh chopped tomatoes, garlic cloves on top, sauce was not salty enough. Fresh chopped garlic totally overpower sweet and tender mussels.  Escargot was not bad. Farro salad did not taste too good and left bad taste in my mouth. Automatic faucet and hand dryer in bathrooms nice expensive touch but I find it annoying. This restaurant needs professional knowledge of good cooking and service improvements.', u\"Horrible service. Mediocre food. They were half empty and still managed to mess up 3 separate orders, my father's steak came at the same time as desert. They then tried to explain it was because their printer wasn't working, like that was somehow our problem. McDonalds doesn't screw up this bad and has better service. Don't waste your time.\", u\"The restaurant is getting its footing. The waitstaff is lovely and very responsive. The food tastes good, but the portions are a little off. My steak frites had a mini-cup of thin fries, which didn't really balance with the slightly undercooked steak. Don't get their house-made sodas, it's a teaspoon of syrup mixed with flat water... The french onion soup is very tasty and on a cold day it warms you up perfectly. It's a nice place to hang out, and hopefully they'll continue getting better!\", u\"I love this place!  This is the Balthazaar of Brooklyn only far cheaper.  It is not as expensive as the 4 $ on the listing indicates. Should be 2-3 $.  Beautifully designed and no detail missed.  A few glitches are why I didn't assign 5 stars.  They are still new so hopefully they will work it out. Finding parking is a real pain here though. My Mom had the perfect burger on a brioche roll with  excellent frites, pickles and a delicious onion marmalade.  The roll was way too small for the burger. I had a Croque-Monsieur which was delicious but not well executed.  I asked the waiter if it came with frites  and he said no but you can order a side.  He neglect to say that it came with roasted potatoes.  It was drenched in bechemel and the bread wasn't toasted or crisp at all.  Next time I'll ask them to hold off a bit on the bechamel and toast the bread please.  I've had this in Paris many times and they definitely need to work on it.  All that aside, one of the owners came to our table before our food came to welcome us.  That was a wonderful thing to do.  He made us feel very welcome and at home.  We will definitely be back because we could see how hard they are trying to please. Sheepshead bay needs a place like this.\", u'The bakery is so nice here, Latte was perfect and the toast with shrimp was yummy as well! Great new addition. Staff were friendly.', u\"The chic ambiance of this cozy brasserie is perfectly paired with the masterful creations of Executive Chef Kemelman. At first glance the perfectly paired decor is complimented by the pristine display kitchen, exhibiting the almost mechanical precision in preparation of every dish. We started with the bread spread platter and seafood sampler, elevating our taste buds to peaks rivaling the Sierra Denali mountains. The fresh seafood lightly dressed in finely flavored sauces, finished with house pickled garnishes amplify the natural flavor of the food. Followed closely by the aromatic French Onion soup, taking us to a small quaint kitchen in a tiny French town. Warming the atmosphere with its delightful aroma and perfectly toasted cheese topping. For our main course the chef recommended the Bouillabaisse and Strip steak. Let's begin with the steak. Ordered rare, the steak was brought to the table perfectly aged and seasoned. Grilled to perfection with a consistancy allowing it to be cut with a fork. The Bouillabaise for lack of a better word was perfect. The seafood perfectly cooked and the broth silky and smooth in its texture. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone looking for amazing food, top notch mixology (emphasis on top notch), and service to match.\", u'I really wanted to point out that I enjoyed breakfast and brunch at Karver.  No other place in sheepsheadbay offers such a beautiful close view of the bay with water front.  Their tables with chairs remind me of Paris, and Parisian coffee, with people casually spending time outside chatting and relaxing.  I did not know what to expect when I saw their prices, which I think are on a high side, but I think it is worth it because the croissants were fresh given with our breakfast, small side salads fresh, and perfect eggs Benedict.  The service was outstanding.  Their bathroom is gorgeous with fresh  red roses.  I was impressed.  I highly recommend this place although I do not get impressed that easily.', u\"The wait staff is a bit disorganized. We waited a very long time for menus, and while doing so observed one of the busboys dropping everything in sight multiple times. Maybe he was new/nervous? The hostess took ages to help us. I'm sure the restaurant will work out the kinks eventually. Our actual waiter, Vladimir, was excellent, helpful, informative, and professional. As for the food, it was just ok. The escargot I ordered had a very intense sour flavor. I'm almost 100% sure the chef used store-bought minced garlic, which is marinated and has a distinct tart taste. Guys, please switch to fresh, I know it takes some time to prep, but it makes all the difference to the food. My friend's burger was decent but overpowered by too much blue cheese. If you are using good meat (which they are), don't smother it in something that hides all the flavor. My other friend's salad had undercooked beans and was too salty. The place is pretty new, so I'm hoping that the menu and service will be tweaked and these issues will be fixed soon. On a better note, the onion mini-croissant bread was super delicious, if a bit greasy.\", u\"Finally, something other than Turkish on Emmons Avenue!!!   Yummy French brasserie.  The Faro salad is probably the best salad I have ever had.  This place just opened, so they are definitely still experiencing hiccups, but I have very high expectations for what's to come.\", u\"Finally Sheepshead Bay has a destination restaurant! Although service was friendly but needed to kick into high gear, we had some seriously good food. Started with bread basket which had outrageous sweet/savory puff pastry, could've eaten 20. We then shared spreads for the table, all very good but chicken liver mousse was exceptionally smooth. Beet salad with goat cheese was simple and delicious. Entr\\xe9e was salmon choucroute, first-rate: generous portion on bed of cabbage and bacon pieces (so crave-able). Asparagus and carrots on side were perfectly cooked. Had bite of friends' chicken for two dish; simply prepared but so flavorful (although potatoes gratin were a little oily instead of creamy). Dessert we shared salted caramel mousse, amazing. Pleasantly stuffed, can't wait to return and try more! Great space, huge open kitchen, nice ambiance.\", u'Just open a month, and apparently still working things out.  The staff is well-meaning but a bit naive, especially when it comes to drinks and wines.  The menu is eclectic and could also use a bit of work: the lobster tatine is lobster salad on a piece of rye bread, the cauliflower cassoulet is more of a side dish than a petit plat.  The chicken for two at $50 is nothing spectacular.  May try the brunch which I was told is coming soon....'], u'198.DokoDemo': [u\"One of my favorite things out of food in life are takoyaki balls. Shudders and drools Homer Simpson style. Traditionally, in case you don't already know, they're wheat battered balls filled with octopus, cooked in a special pan, and covered with takoyaki sauce, mayo, and bonito fish flakes. It sounds scary but it's truly amazing. Came in with a friend and we split a large order (8 for $8.75 or you can do 4 for $5.75). About average pricing for these puppies, they never come cheap. Quality - honestly some of the best. It's hard to beat Otafuku or Karl's Balls but these are pretty neck and neck. They came out piping hot and we burnt our tongues multiple times over in anticipation. Creamy insides with plenty of octopus that was cooked at the perfect consistency - not too chewy - not too mushy. Oh, sweet jesus. \\n\\nThe seating is communal and open benches with stools. Plenty of seating for the smallish size of the place. They also sell noodles - Yakisoba and of course Okonomiyaki umami pancakes (which I also love but will have to settle with trying next time). Menu is simple but if you like those three things and traditional Japanese street food, you're all good. They also have actually over 90 locations scattered throughout Japan and this is their first location in the USA. I just hope it lasts longer than my long but not forgotten Japadog that used to be down the street.\", u\"Finally got to try this place last night with coworkers. Last night was one of those super hot and humid NY summer (but not summer since it's October...) nights. When we got into the restaurant, the AC was very weak and the restaurant was about twice as hot as outside. We had to immediately ask the restaurant manager to turn on the AC. \\n\\nThere were a slew of people at the restaurant when we got there - maybe around 5 or 6 folks. Anyways, the menu is quite simple. There are three entrees you choose from, and then a few sides. Drinks are also available next to where you pay. \\n\\nWe ordered everything on the menu, including sides of the matcha chips and the omelet. Everything on the menu is less than $9.75, so it's definitely affordable and reasonably priced being in the les. The octopus balls were delicious, and we wished we had gotten more than the smaller sized of it. The yakisoba was seasoned well and very freshly made (right there in front of you!) and portioned were good. The meat in the yakisoba was a little skimpy but the quantity is still a lot. The okonomoyaki was delicious! I haven't had much okonomoyaki in NY - only at Japanese inspired festivals throughout the summer - and to be able to find a restaurant that specializes in it is great. Lastly, the matcha chips were definitely unique. Couldn't taste the matcha flavor that much, but it was served right from the grill, so the heat was nice. \\n\\nDokodemo is definitely a quick stop and shop restaurant, so naturally, your expectations are that the food is ordered quickly, and done quickly. However, not the case. It took around 15-20 minutes, aka what it'd take at a sit down restaurant, in order to get our food. This is the only reason I'd give it a 4 instead of a 5. My advice to management is to work on their turnover rate on giving out food.\", u'DokoDemo serves some of the most authentic Japanese street food, including Okonomiyaki, Takoyaki, and Yakisoba.\\n\\nOwner Shin Takagi wanted to bring the authentic taste and flavor of Japanese street food to NYC, so he and his business partner Kazu Kamehara, who together owns 96 restaurants in Japan, opened DokoDemo in East Village early this summer. At DokoDemo, you can order favorites like okonomiyaki and takoyaki at the counter and watch the food being prepared right before your eyes in the open kitchen.\\n\\nSukiyaki Omelet\\n\\nTender slices of beef is wrapped with thin layers of fluffy egg omelet in this delicious, shareable side dish. The Sukiyaki Omelet is topped with generous amount of scallions. Eat it as served or drizzle some hot sauce.\\n\\nTakoyaki\\n\\nA fan favorite, the Takoyaki - or balls stuffed with octopus - has perfectly crispy exterior with soft, doughy interior. The Takoyaki at DokoDemo is made with octopus, cabbage, carrots, and flour batter and topped with bonito flakes, kewpie mayo, and sweet brown drizzle. You can either order 4 or 8 balls of takoyaki.\\n\\nYakisoba\\n\\nThe pan-fried Yakisoba - which can be topped with your choice of pork, beef, octopus, or shrimp with either the classic or soy sauce - is generously portioned. The dish includes a bed of grilled noodles with chunks of cabbage, pickled radishes, scallions, bonito flakes, and a protein of your choice.\\n\\nOkonomiyaki\\n\\nMy personal favorite at DokoDemo, the Okonomiyaki - or savory Japanese pancakes - was such a delight to the palate. The crispy surface and edges of the okonomiyaki was perfectly balanced with the soft, chewy inside that features batter with cabbage, radish, scallions, and other vegetables. Like the Yakisoba, you can top the okonomiyaki with four different types of protein. The dish is served with squirts of mayo, bonito flakes, and sweet sauce.', u\"East Village already has a ton of Japanese spots, not to mention Otafuku which pretty much offers the same three main items: Takoyaki, Okonomiyaki, and Yakisoba. The last time I've been to Otafuku was when they were still at their old location on Stuyvesant Street. In my opinion, DokoDemo is very comparable to the Otafuku from what I remember. I'm not sure how good Otafuku is at their new location since I haven't tried it yet.\\n\\nWhen I came in during lunch, the restaurant was fairly empty, so you could get in and out pretty quickly. They have some tables, counters, and stools to eat in the restaurant. You order at the cash register and they will bring the food to you at whatever table/counter you choose to sit at. They have an open kitchen so you can watch them prepare all the food while you ate. I saw one person preparing the octopus.\\n\\nTakoyaki - We ordered the 4 balls for $5.75. The takoyaki was very large and soft with tasty pieces of octopus. Only annoying thing for me is they put too much mayo on it. I really dislike mayo, so next time I think I'll have to ask them to not put any mayo at all.\\n\\nOkonomiyaki - For the okonomiyaki, you can choose pork, beef, octopus (+$1.50), or shrimp (+$1.50). My favorite okonomiyaki is from this restaurant in Pittsburgh where they use a lot of cabbage, so the pancake becomes very tender. I was hoping this was the case, but this had more cut up random vegetables and batter, and not too much cabbage. It was still a good pancake. Again, too much mayo. \\n\\nYakisoba - For the yakisoba, you can also choose pork, beef, octopus, or shrimp. I liked the taste of the wine in the noodles, but I think I would probably still be hungry after eating this. \\n\\nMatcha chips - I loved these chips! I think the name is misleading, since it doesn't taste like matcha at all. It tastes more like warm, Lays nori chips. They actually heat up the chips on the grill. It's $2.95 for a plate of chips, which I think is actually cheaper than buying a bag of Lays nori chips from an Asian supermarket. Plus the chips are warm.\\n\\nCabbage with garlic & soy sauce - We got this to balance out all the carbs we were ingesting. There was so much garlic in the cabbage, but it was very tasty. You'll probably have some bad breath afterwards though.\", u'I\\'ve wanted to DokoDemo ever since I saw this spot on the \"Hot and New\" list. If you\\'re looking for Takoyaki, you probably know about the other famous spot a couple blocks away. I wanted to give DokoDemo a try because this was closer to me and the quality of food from the \"other spot\" is not consistent. \\n\\nDokoDemo is not cheap. You even have to pay extra for shrimp in your okonomiyaki. However, there\\'s beef option here with no extra charge. Service is really good -- attentive and courteous staff. \\n\\nI ordered a beef okonomiyaki and 4 takoyaki. They make the food to order which ensures that the dough is not dried out or over cooked. Because of that, you do have to wait a while. I ordered the food to go and it came in these nice containers. Much better presentation than the \"other spot\".\\n\\nAs far as okonomiyaki flavor, DokoDemo\\'s flavor is slightly different from the one I\\'m used to. I can\\'t put my finger on it and I tried to dissect the food to try to figure it out. First off, there\\'s much more scallions in the DokoDemo version. The cabbage is also cut different which provides a different texture and crunch. There\\'s also these fried rice or something that gives a crunchy texture. The portion is also slightly smaller which is a bit disappointing considering it\\'s more than the \"other spot\". For me, the DokoDemo okonomiyaki fell a little short.\\n\\nNow on to the takoyaki. The takoyaki texture is much better here. The outside is crispy and the inside is soft and chewy. There are multiple and smaller pieces of octopus inside. Again, this is different from the \"other spot\" since that only gives you one piece. The takoyaki here is a bit more salty which I didn\\'t like. While I liked the crispy outside, there are parts that are also burnt. \\n\\nI would probably come back for the takoyaki to give it another try. However, with their prices, I probably wont come back often.', u\"It's a warm September Saturday night, and me and my party of six are looking to grab some delicious Japanese food in the East Village area. At first, we checked out Benemon right there on East 4th. It was too small to accommodate us, so we did some Yelping and found another place that does Japanese cuisine, DokoDemo.\\n\\nWhen we get there, we found that it had the space we needed to get all of us seated. Notably the place doesn't serve alcohol and doesn't do table service. It has more of fast-food vibe.\\n\\nAfter perusing their very small menu, we decided we'd give this place a try. The kind cashier took each of our orders. Most of us ordered the combination of the octopus pancake dish (Okonomiyaki) and octopus balls dish (Takoyaki). As we waited for our meals to get prepared, we drank some of their authentic Japanese soft drinks.\\n\\nOur orders starting coming out maybe 15 minutes after placing them. They came out about 3 minutes after one another. Each one of our meals tasted and looked amazing. The different sauces and items they used to garnish the food really work. The octopus pieces inside the meals were yummy.\\n\\nAs a group, we also noticed that the meals came out unbelievably hot  when they came to us. So it took us a while before we could actually start eating the food.\\n\\nFor sure, I can see myself coming back to this place again if I'm in the mood for Japanese food in that area.\", u'Best Takoyaki in town but they also serve a killer okonomiyaki. \\n\\n\"Takoyaki is a ball-shaped Japanese snack made of a wheat flour-based batter and cooked in a special molded pan. It is typically filled with minced or diced octopus, tempura scraps, pickled ginger, and green onion.\"-wiki\\n\\nUpon entering Dokodemo, walk left to admire the okonomiyaki and Takoyaki grilling in the open style kitchen, then order from the register and seat yourself. \\n\\nFaves: takoyaki and potato chips are served warm with nori (seaweed) on top.\\n\\nThe waitress will bring your order to your table. There\\'s not much seating so don\\'t come with many friends. But it\\'s BYOB, so that\\'s a plus. \\n\\nGreat place for snacking over beer.', u'Pretty solid Japanese joint for a quick snack. DokoDemo reminds me of my travels in Osaka where every corner I turn is a vendor selling Takoyaki, Yakisoba or Okonomiyaki. All dishes were made to order, guaranteeing that everything is served steaming hot, just like they should be! I opted for the takoyaki, yakisoba and matcha chips, and they did not disappoint! The matcha chips were amazing and addicting; if not for portion control, I think I would be munching on these all day.\\nThe yakisoba was a tad salty & oily for me but nonetheless delicious! \\nGrilled food such as these pairs perfectly with iced cold oolong tea or green tea, which they offer!', u\"Best Takoyaki in NYC. If you're a fan of this dish, then this is the best new spot to come. Also enjoyed the surprisingly sweet sukiyaki omelette and the matcha potato chips, which surprisingly have are uniquely tasty and come out hot. Would skip the okonomiyaki - too similar to the takoyaki and the takoyaki is much better.\\n\\n5 stars!!!!!!\", u\"I can see people lining up outside for  DokoDemo's takoyaki very soon. I have been to Osaka in April, and I will happily say that the octopus takoyaki I tried tonight was even better than the one I had in Japan. \\n\\nMost of the takoyaki I have tried in other restaurants lack the crunchy exterior texture. Not DokoDemo's. A nice crunch outside, hot gooey inside, and a big octopus piece. And that first bite must empower you with the ginger. Yes, DokoDemo's takoyaki has it all. The sukiyaki omelette was my second favorite. Sukiyaki was not too sweet and tender enough that it melted with the soft omelette. \\n\\nOctopus takoyaki, sukiyaki omelets, octopus okonomiyaki, matcha chips, and two drinks totaled ~$30. An awesome price for food in East Village. You pay directly at the counter and can watch the chef make the food in front. I am so glad this place is close to NYU. I will come back to try their other takoyaki variations. \\n\\nXuenie's recommendation: Octopus takoyaki and sukiyaki omelette.\", u\"Plane tickets to Osaka run about $900. So I'm psyched that DokoDemo can bring you there for under $10.\\n\\nThis spot is focused on three categories of classic Japanese street food: yakisoba (noodle stir fry), okonomoyaki (meat and cabbage omelette), and takoyaki (deep fried balls of goodness). These can be filled a wide range of meat: chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, and octopus. There are also a few fried sides rounding out the menu, as well as a fridge of Japanese soft drinks.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is very casual, with orders taken at the counter and the food being made right in front of you. You can take out or sit on stools at communal tables. It was a bit warm when I came in; don't know if their air conditioner is up to the heat of the open kitchen combined with New York summer.\\n\\nI went for octopus takoyaki, with 5 for $6.50. It was ready in about 5 or 10 minutes. My balls were gorgeous, with their requisite drizzles of mayo and a sweet teriyaki sauce and topped with aonori and bonito flakes.\\n\\nThe batter was delicious-- eggy and umami and loaded with octopus and green onion. Unfortunately, it was undercooked and fell apart completely while eating it. The octopus was very chewy... I had to go traditional for the first time, but I'd choose a different meat next time.\\n\\nNevertheless, I'm excited to try out the rest of the menu, and I love that this spot exists so close to me!\", u'This place makes yummy Japanese \"street\" food. They specialize in Takoyaki, Okonomiyaki and Yakisoba. The place was not crowded. I prefer it to be this way , but I am sure it will become popular soon. I think it\\'s a great place for a snack. The prices are not too bad, mostly under $10 (unless you add things). Takoyaki was my favorite. Sukiyaki Omelet was delicious but my stomach couldn\\'t handle the heavy oils from the fatty meat.', u'Since discovering Okonomyoaki in Japan I have been looking for a go-to spot in NYC. Look no further. DokoDemo does a great job making this meat and cabbage omelette (I went with the shrimp as my topping). The chef - a friendly guy from japan, told me he opened tons of these stores in Japan and now is trying it in NYC. I would say that in Japan they also have noodles, so its a little lighter of a meal in NYC. Nevertheless, for the price (Under $10) it was a great meal in a very chill atmosphere, no frills seating. Anyone walking toward the east village should stop by here for an authentic Japanese experience.', u\"When I first got to Dokodemo, I was surprised by how big the signage was. I was expecting a smaller spot, similar to those on St Mark's but I was wrong. Walking in, the place was fairly spacious and clean. Cooks on one end, tables and chairs on the other. What was awesome was that you have the option of sitting outside.\\n\\nI absolutely love Japanese grilled food and since I was super hungry, my friend and I ordered about 5 dishes: Pork yakisoba, Takoyaki, Okonomiyaki, beef Sukiyaki, and plum pickles. The plum pickles came out first. To my surprise, the dish is consist of cucumber with plum sauce along with other ingredients that gives it a smokey bacon flavor (could be the fish flakes). Next came the beef Sukiyaki. Ive never ordered this before and I was very surprised by the soft texture of the egg and how it tenderly wrapped around thin slices of beef. I absolutely loved it! Next came the Okonomiyaki which was very soft and had a doughy texture, which is how it should be. The dish I was anticipating the most for was the Takoyaki and it did not disappoint. It was crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. I noticed their version included more than just batter. It includes cut up vegetables that adds a more savory taste to the dish. As for the yakisoba, I felt the flavor was a bit too intense for me so it became my least favorite of the five dishes.\", u\"Great spot for Japanese street food, which can be rather difficult to find.  DokoDemo has takoyaki, okonomiyaki, and yakisoba for 'main' dishes and several other side dishes.  One of the side dishes, the matcha potato chips, was intriguing and tasted delicious.  For my main dish, I went with the okonomiyaki, which was wonderful, perhaps some of the best in the city!  While I did have to wait for a bit to actually receive my order, that is the nature of the beast when it comes to okonomiyaki as it should be cooked to order.\\nThe location had a very trendy vibe.\", u\"Came across this interesting new Japanesee restaurant while searching for a place to eat with my friends one evening. The place was cozy, but we were the only ones in. We had just the urge to try Japanese street food and what we got was better than expected.\\nWe had the Takoyaki and the Okonomiyaki, both of which were exquisite. The takoyaki are balled wheat flour typically filled with minced or diced octopus, tempura scraps, pickled ginger, and green onion. It was soft, tasty and declicious. We couldn't get enough. Each bite was enough to send us to heaven.\\nNext was the Okonomiyaki, which is a Japanese style pancake. Also very delicious. It was extremely savory and blew our minds how good it was. Definitely get it with beef, that is the pairing that goes best with the Okonomiyaki! \\nWe will definitely be returning here. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for Japanese street food. Try this place before it gets too popular!\", u'I came with friends tonight for the first time. They taste just like what u get in Japan.  Will come again for some more.', u\"Just visited once and already love this place. I'm from Japan but I've never thought I find the best Okonomiyaki ever in my life in New York City! \\nI ordered Okonomiyaki with beef, which was so rich but not heavy, beef was very tender and juicy, veggies are soft but crunchy, it was really the best! \\nThe place is very clean and simple, \\nI'll definitely come back again (maybe tomorrow!).\", u\"Nice bite to eat in east village. It's a serve yourself styled place, kind of fast casual. I tried the pork okonomiyaki, which was pretty flavourful. Serving size is on the small size. For a fast casual place the wait was not super quick, it took 15ish minutes to make.\", u\"The good: The food is as authentic as Japan. I've been to Japan many times, and I can honestly say that their food is as good as back in Nippon. \\n\\nThe Bad: The portions were small. Okonomiyaki is usually a huge pancake like dish in Japan that you can share with up to 4 people (at least most places I've went to.) Here, it was barely enough for myself. \\n\\nI also ordered Yakisoba, but that was too small too. I felt as if both dishes were appetizers.\\n\\nI might come back because the taste was very good, but the portion was a little too small. But I do hope they succeed, and I hope they get alcohol, too.\"], u'67.Dough': [u\"I've been to the stand at Smorgasburg twice but never to the brick and mortar.\\n\\nThat being said, my goodness these doughnuts are epic. At 3.50 a pop, one of these will put you into a food coma faster than thanksgiving dinner.\\n\\nHyperboles aside, the donuts I got were both great. The first was their salted chocolate (about a year ago) and it was near perfect, slightly dry.\\n\\nI went back today and got the dulce de leche with almond and it was incredible. Not sure if the preparation is different for the different flavors or if they had just improved overall. I guess I'll have to go back. OH WELL, MORE DOUGHNUTS FOR ME!\\n\\nSeriously, good deal for what you're getting and it's hard to find that at Smorgasburg. Bravo, Dough.\", u\"Personally not a fan of Dough's donuts. They're super bread-y, instead of soft and fluffy fried goodness. As a result, not only are they hefty by weight, but feel hefty (even when you just eat half) in your stomach.\\n\\nNot sure why anyone likes fried bread dough covered in too-sweet icing.\\n\\nPersonally, I'm more a fan of the light and fluffy Dunkin' Donuts over Dough's doughy fried dough.\", u\"Located on a corner, right across the street from the projects! Very small\\nSpot w/ NO SEATING! Straight Order & Bounce. \\n\\nI don't understand the hype! The doughnuts were ok, nothing special. They were big & filled with alot of dough. The shop was very clean & the register girl was friendly & informative! \\n\\nI tried 5 different doughnuts & they were ok & just ok. LoL I thought I was missing something. The doughnuts left me wanting more, it definitely didn't give me that satisfaction, like when I eat a Krispy Kreme right off the conveyor belt. Overall I Def won't be returning.\\n\\nFYI: They also sell Coffee, Tea & other assorted beverages\", u'These donuts are almost double the size of your average DD donuts and very \"doughy\" - as expected. Got the cafe au lait, hibiscus and the chocolate nibs donut and hibiscus was surprisingly my favorite (even though I\\'m a die hard chocolate fan). But they would be SO much better if they were fresh out of the oven, so I took them home and warmed them up for a bit. It\\'s a small store without much seating so recommend taking it to go. \\n\\nOverall, they make a solid donut but I still prefer beiler\\'s donuts in Philadelphia.', u\"Did you said DOUGH?! \\n\\nDoughnut Dough Doughnut Doug\\n On a Sunday afternoon  what Better that to endure a delicious treat made at the spot. What a Surprise they were playing Bachata!!!!! made me feel welcome and at home. The store is in a corner, you can't sit inside there's no space is a pick up store you can say,  on the other hand you  can pop a squad outside the store and enjoy this delicious pastry flavors From Dulce de Leche, Passion  Fruit, Salty Dark Chocolate, Nutella, Glazed (*my favorite*) \\nWe had them all!!!!!! The donuts are pretty good a little on the dough side maybe that's why it's call Dough, Ha! One can be share between 2 people. The reason  for my 3 starts is because they won't stay fresh for next day it got stale pretty fast. \\nHibiscus is one of the favorites but not for me, I like it a more in the plan side.  Not sure if I'll come back but if am in the area will deft stop by.\", u\"Dough is by Chef Fany Gerson and has been around since '10.  This place only makes small batches of handmade doughnuts  on a daily basis, so get there early, as flavors do run out!\\n\\nWe stopped by a little after their opening in the morning, and tried their Plain Glazed (made with pure vanilla extract and a touch of salt, this yeast doughnut was light, fluffy, and had the perfect ratio of the glaze to the dough), and a Blood Orange (a tart and sweet glaze with a candied orange slice on top, this was super pretty to look at and delicious to eat!).  Each of the doughnuts really tasted what they were called as, which was great!  The hubs, who is a huge yeast doughnut fan, loved them both and couldn't stop talking about them!\\n\\nThe doughnuts are pretty large in size and a great way to start your morning or have a snack.  I'd love to come back and try out the Lemon Poppy, Alfajor, Pumpkin, and the Hibiscus.  I also want to try out their 'doughka'! Note they also have cake doughnuts as well as catering options.\\n\\nThis is more of a take-out place; there's also a window into their kitchen where you can see the staff handmaking the doughnuts for the day.\\n\\n+tasty yeast doughnuts \\n+small batches of handmade doughnuts daily\\n+take-out only\", u\"This place was fine. Nothing to rave about but the donuts were cool. A little dry for my liking but they were big and the pricing wasn't bad. There are benches outside where you can sit if you'd like. The staff was friendly and of course service was quick.\", u\"Yes these doughnuts are ginormous and beautiful, but after trying several of their flavors I have concluded that they are more sugary than flavorful. I've visited the Brooklyn location and Urbanspace shop in Midtown.\", u\"This dough hole is hella magical.\\n\\nLet me tell you something: I am not a sweets person and I definitely don't care for donuts. I know. Fat girl doesn't like sweets. What a lie, right? Nope. I'm a savory type of chick, so I don't even think about dessert joints. I got fat off of fried chicken, not cake and ice cream.\\n\\nThe front desk girl at the hotel I was staying at mentioned Dough to me. I wasn't really interested in going, but her birthday was coming up and she's a sweetheart, so I made it a point of getting her something as a thank you. She recommended all of their donuts and I took her suggestion.\\n\\nOn my first visit, I got two passion fruit (I live for this stuff), two hibiscus, lemon poppy seed, and chocolate with cacao nibs donuts. I gave her a hibiscus and my coworker the lemon poppy and chocolate. Took a bite into my passion fruit and oh my god.\\n\\nI don't like sweet sweet sweet and I don't like cakey things and this donut was both! And I loved it! The texture was perfect. The flavors were nice. The little crunch of the dried seeds was too good. I would have preferred the taste to be a little more on the sour side, but that's it. A passion fruit donut with some Goya passion fruit nectar??? No wonder I'm on the verge of diabetes. So worth of it. They have one that I heard has mango, lime, and chili. How do I get that in my life?\\n\\nI went back two more times. First time I got the hibiscus, passion fruit, AND blood orange. It was too cute! That candied orange slice just out a smile on my face. That paired with a blood orange San Pellegrino? Oh yeeeeeees~ \\n\\nOn my third visit, they were an hour and a half from closing and running out of donuts fast. I had to settle for lemon poppy, dulce de leche, and toasted coconut. I went in with okay expectations, but I wasn't won over. The lemon poppy was really good, but the dulce de leche was overly sweet to me (which I'm sure it's supposed to be, I just have weak tastebuds) and the toasted coconut? Dry as hell. Never again. I also got some milk.. that was chunky.. was it supposed to be???\\n\\nBut besides that, this place is definitely worth the $40 Uber round trip. The people are nice, the music is popping, the bakers in the back are amazing at what they do, and the smells are heaven. Just an excellent place to get your sweet tooth fix.\", u'These donuts are a decent price and filling, but still, I have not been amazed. When do they have hot fresh donuts?? I wish I knew the time they have fresh ones right out of the oven??\\n\\nI tried the chocolate nibble, the cafe au lait, and the lemon poppy seed. I liked the lemon poppy seed because the lemon glaze was very lemony!\\n\\nThis location is cheaper than the Manhattan location by $0.25 by the way.', u'BEST DONUTS! No arguments, just facts.\\n\\nYou will not find a fresher, tastier, softer, more flavorful donut. There are places who flash their fancy donuts, but the flavor falls through, whether it\\'s too artificial or doesn\\'t taste like the flavor name at all, or it\\'s just rock solid and dry.\\n\\nThis place WILL NOT disappoint. Their donuts are being made fresh, ALL DAY LONG!! Bro, I kid you not, and you can watch from the inside of the shop because the kitchen is through the glass windows to the left of the store, and you can actually watch the process of the bakers hand-making each donut to perfection!\\n\\nFlavors include: blood orange, cinnamon sugar, chocolate cocoa nib, dolce de leche almond, plain glazed, cafe au lait, salted chocolate caramel, mocha-almond crunch, passion fruit, toasted coconut, hibiscus, Nutella, lemon poppy, and horchata.\\n\\nI\\'ve tried blood orange, dolce de leche, cafe au lait, passion fruit, toasted coconut. Hibiscus, and lemon poppy! And a special apple pie!\\n\\nEach had a wonderful flavor. The blood orange had a piece of candied blood orange slice up top. That was a wonderful touch on top of a strong flavor of blood orange and a soft donut. \\nThe toasted coconut one of my favorites had a wonderful coconut flavor and the fact that it was toasted was so delightful. The donut itself has a hint of sugar making it the perfect combo of a sweet topping and a soft plain donut. Not over powering not over sweet and never artificial.\\n\\nEach donut has something special to offer and as soon as it hits your tongue it takes you to a different planet, literally, its THAT good.\\n\\nMake this next on your \"go to\" list!', u\"There are two types of upscale donuts in the world, one of which are superbly mediocre donuts with a bland and uninspired base. Most places counteract this deficiency with fancy-pants toppings and try to pass it off as gourmet and, unfortunately, will charge accordingly. The combination comes off tasting like a cookie/cake-donut hybrid or just one dimensional in taste, with the topping(s) stealing the flavor show.\\n\\nThe other type are Dough donuts, with a yeasty base (in a good way) and all the available toppings compliment the base, making the each donut delectable! There are no artificial tasting ingredients, just pure bliss.\\n\\nSure, Doughnut Plant and Camden's Blue Star Donuts exist, but they're also not within 3 blocks of my condo. Don't get me started with KK or DD.. bleh!\", u\"Can I just say Yum! \\nI'm a doughnut fanatic and I'm from the west coast and we all know what that means. East coast doughnuts are mediocre. UNTIL NOW! \\n\\nWhenever I'm in BK I always stop and get my fix of Dough donuts. And if you haven't had them. Shame on you!! Get there now! And make sure to try the pomegranate doughnut. \\n\\nI only gave 4 stars because they are a small shop and sell a limited amount of donuts but they aren't limited on deliciousness I promise.\", u\"I just saw Dough was voted best doughnuts in the USA, and I couldn't agree more! I didn't even like doughnuts before, having grown up in Boston and eating dry crappy dunkin donuts. I tried the blood orange for the first time at Brooklyn Flea and fell in love. Since then I've been biking to this location and I've had the hibiscus, passion fruit, lemon poppy, dulce de leche, chocolate with nibs, and many more. Prob eaten at least 50 over the past 7 years. Writing this review is making me want to eat one right now!\", u\"The dough. I could probably end the review here but I'll continue. The dough itself is simply amazing not to mention the awesome flavors to choose from. They have everything from salted chocolate to hibiscus and everything in between like passion fruit, Nutella, and Cinnamon Sugar. There's not one bad donut here. Whether you're in Brooklyn or Manhattan don't go anywhere else to satisfy for donut cravings.\", u'When I was a student at Pratt I basically lived here, and every time I visit New York I trek to Brooklyn just for Dough! (I know there are locations in the city but love to visit anyways). Their doughnuts are fresh and you can watch them making them through the window. My absolute favorite is the Blood Orange, followed closely by the Hibiscus. I wish they would come down to Miami!! Iced coffee is also delicious! Missing you guys every day :)', u\"Doughnuts are very very good. They are fresh tasty and everything you would look for in a good donut.  My favorite is the hibiscus which is not overly sweet and unique and the chocolate salted caramel which is so yummy and chocolatey. \\n\\nThe service is alright but could be better. The man with the bandana at the register is a sweetheart. One thing I didn't like is here you are buying these pricey donuts and they legit throw them in a bag like really I bought three donuts couldn't box them nice? \\n\\nThe place is WAYYYYY TO SMALL. The line on a Sunday reaches out the store door and your either stuck waiting outside or your in between inside of the store and being stuck outside freezing. \\n\\n\\nDonuts delivery quality. I purchased 3 donuts for 8 dollars they are the equivalent to two donuts from Dunkin' Donuts. \\n\\nOh yea parking sucks.\", u\"What you need to know: \\n- I have made my rounds of the NYC donut spots and I have to say this is my favorite! \\n- What makes it so good? The dough is cake-like, yet so pillowy soft! The flavors are so creative, sumptuous and downright irresistible! And you get your money's worth ($2.75) here, doughnuts are 4 inches across! \\n- very friendly staff and accepts credit cards\\n\\nWhat you should order:\\n- Lemon poppy, cafe au lait, cheesecake, and hibiscus!!!\", u\"So October 29 2015 I decided to give up refined sugar and alcohol for a year. Yes, you heard that right. I'm totally one of those people who weirdly does all these food experiments because I like testing my resolve and discipline. Why? I'm not quite sure. Something about it makes me feel like if I can do that with the ordinary tasks of life like what I put inside my body, then it'll transfer to other parts of my life? This is way too much information. Sorry for the diary.\\n\\nAnyway, I was still living in Chicago but I up and moved to Brooklyn in late December 2015 because duh, I've BEEN Brooklyn before I've BEEN IN Brooklyn. (If you don't get it, you just ain't getting it...) Wanted to trade that Chi state of mind for that Empire State because if I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, am I right? (2016 was a terrible year, but I think that has more to do with the year than with my move or my giving up alcohol.) \\n\\nAnyway, so all year, I'm watching people talk about Dough and eat Dough and I'm just staying in my lane, eating carrots, even avoiding bread most of the time because sugar is in everything (and is probably killing America tbh). But everywhere I go, I see Dough. I see Dough at the BK fair, I see Dough at work offices, I see Dough in my dreams, and so it starts to haunt me.\\n\\nBut somehow by God's good grace and share force of will, I make it through the LEAP year - which again was a terrible year - without alcohol and most refined sugar. But sure enough, on October 29 2016, a couple of old friends and new friends meet me at this spot and watch as I eat my first doughnut (Sorry but like British English spellings are life even after almost ten years of partying in the USA). Anyway, so I eat this doughnut right, and I feel like I'm getting some kind of spiritual experience because in truth, as I was eating it, everything was beautiful and nothing hurt. I imagine this is what heaven must feel like all the time. Been back a few times and only a few, because trying to be refined-sugar smart these days. But if I want sugar in the form of a treat, and specifically a doughnut, I'm very likely to come here. \\n\\nSo, yeah, anyway, highly recommend.\", u'Doughnuts as big as my head. And oh soooo delicious!!!\\nThe service was prompt and the server was courteous.'], u'154.Sunshine': [u\"This is a pretty awesome spot for brunch. It's a neighborhood spot, but I went due to the good reviews on Yelp.\\n\\nMy friend arrived before me, and they were nice about seating him first before I arrived. That was a kind gesture because most brunch places make you wait until whole party arrives (the move is understandable albeit a little annoying).\\n\\nThe menu is standard brunch fare, but the service was super chill and friendly. I enjoyed my baked eggs in tomato sauce and my friend liked his egg Benedict.\\n\\nThey were also very cool with dietary accommodations!\", u\"We came here for a late brunch. Is it still called brunch when you eat at 2:30pm? \\n\\nIf I came by myself, I would have given Sunshine 4 stars. My Brussels sprouts hash was delicious. The poach eggs and smoked paprika were a nice touch. \\n\\nUnfortunately, my sister and husband were disappointed. My sister's medium rare burger was too rare, and she had to wait another 15 minutes for a new burger. My husband's medium rare burger was well done, and he didn't get the biscuits that he was craving. The waitress told him that they ran out as she served him his burger. \\n\\nMoral of the story: Don't order the burger, and if you come here after 2:30pm, you'll probably miss out on the biscuits.\", u\"Went Sunday 7/30/2017. Brunch.\\nI like the ambiance and seating. Nice laid back place. Good, compact menu. Got the burger and a cocktail. Cocktail was great. Like that the burger was grass fed beef but it was overcooked (ordered medium, was well done) and had American cheese instead of the cheddar I paid $1.50 extra for. Why do so many places have trouble with burgers? \\nI'd go back.\", u'I visited the restaurant on recommendation from my son who had visited before. The experience was not the same as his first visit. The grits came out cold and had to be sent back to be reheated. My son pointed out that the portion size was smaller compared to his first visit. My son ordered baked eggs and it came out soupy. The server was subpar and not pleasant.', u'Very friendly staff, nice atmosphere, great music, and the food was amazing!! I went for dinner and got the fritters, peach salad, and prosciutto flat bread. Loved all of it!', u'Came here for Sunday brunch and managed to snag the last seat outside--it was 62\\xb0F in February! Ordered the baked eggs and side of bacon with friend. Also got a Bloody Mary. Really like the Bloody Mary; the spices worked well together and it was just enough heat. It was also strong because a few sips in, I was feeling it and believe me, I can hold my liquor. \\n\\nThe baked eggs were delicious. Hot and flavorful. Came with toasted chewy bread--perfect for dipping into the tomato sauce/runny eggs combo. Bacon was thick and not too greasy. \\n\\nHighly recommend and want to come back for dinner/late night snacks.', u'Definitely one of the better eateries in Prospect Heights/Crown Heights. \\n\\nThe food is exceptional and consistent. \\n\\nHappy hour pricing is great. \\n\\nOn the first visit I had the Steak Frites which was excellent. Second visit had the burger, also a winner although my idea of MR differs from Sunshines. It was over cooked. \\n\\n\\nI would give this restaurant 5 stars but what hangs me up is the service. This seems to be a pooled house and multiple people come to your table throughout the course of the meal which is to say the least confusing. I can look past that- biggest issue is the lack luster attitude of everyone from the person that greets you at the door to the many people taking care of your table. \\n\\nTwo visits and on both occasions it seemed as if the staff had somewhere else to be and something better to do. I would expect more, service wise, out of an establishment that is boasting such well executed food. \\n\\nI am the GM of a bar/ restaurant and I consider myself a very polite and conscious diner. Unfortunately every thank you on my part was met with a \"sure\" and frankly our server seemed annoyed to be taking our order which on an average bill of $50 per head is very disappointing. \\n\\nWill definitely go again for the cuisine but if the attitude of the staff remains consistent I may not return. \\n\\nBon Apetit!', u\"Popped in there for brunch after taking a stroll in the BBG. We got in just before they finished serving brunch. I had the shrimp and grids and hubs got a burger. \\nI loved my shrimp and grids. I thought it was flavorful and creamy. The shrimps were quite large. \\n\\nIt was a nice surprise for my hubs because he didn't want to try this place at first. He liked his burger. It was solid! \\n\\nThe service was good. Our waitress was attentive. \\n\\nTook out a star because it took quite a long time for our food to come but it was worth it. \\n\\nWe tried to go back again another weekend, the wait was over 40 min for brunch. We decided against it. \\n\\nI like the decor inside. It's cute, chic, and rustic. It does give you a hipster feel.\", u'My friend and I walked around trying to find a good brunch place in the area and we were so thrilled to run into sunshine co. I loved the atmosphere walking in. I ordered the Brussels sprout bowl and it was to die for  never have I thought to combine that with potatoes eggs and peppers. It was absolutely scrumptious. My friend got the strawberry toast and that was the perfect light dish. Highly recommend this place!', u\"Husband said, half portions=half tip but should the server suffer for chef choices? \\n\\nCitrus French toast was fragrant if a little over sweet. The texture was a balance of sponge and crust- just what your mouth desires in French toast. \\n\\nI had the steak and eggs. One egg was a little undercooked, with slimy egg white bits.The steak was two inches by two and a half inches which they said was because it shrank from cooking. Ok. It was tasty and moist so there's that. The salad was fresh and evenly dressed. \\n\\nWe were seated quickly and the servers were pleasant. My server initially agreed that the portion size looked too small and asked if I had started eating- I had not- but he came back from the kitchen insisting it was 4oz of steak. It was typically priced at 16$ but oh so small. And the 4.50 a glass fresh squeezed orange juice which, yay, they didn't stretch with ice? It was half a glass tall so probably 4 oz too. I left hungry so I won't be going back.\", u\"We went for brunch prior to visiting the Sakura festival at the Brooklyn botanical gardens.\\n\\nThey don't really take reservations, but the queue moves quickly. They also are incredibly dog friendly and will bring your dog a water bowl (and ice) when seated outside. We sat outside, but inside the tables are all high tops, so if you don't like that kind of seating, its not ideal. \\n\\nHighly recommend the fresh biscuits/scones to start and the roasted Brussels sprout hash. My only complaint is that the hash is incredibly oily/greasy but the eggs are perfectly poached.\\n\\nOverall, very reasonably priced brunch with nice iced coffees. They only have soy or regular milk, not skim, but nice none the less. \\n\\nIf i was in the area again, I'd definitely pop round.\", u'This is a cute little place that is relatively medium in size. The restaurant has an elegant quiet pub vibe to it for a Tuesday night. The drinks are moderately priced and the food is decent. I will say that the appetizers can stand alone as a meal, if one just wants something small to nibble on. I had the goat cheese flatbread and french fries. Some may think that the flatbread may have too much goat cheese, but I am a HUGE fan of goat cheese, so it was not a problem for me. \\n\\nMy only issue is that the bartender and I had a slight misunderstanding about the service industry in NYC in general. He seemed to have gotten pissed because I did not agree with him. \\n\\nOh well there are plenty similar places to frequent in Brooklyn.', u\"Top-notch has spot for brunch. We arrived after the Brooklyn half and only had about a 30 minute wait (arrived ~11:30a). Everything on the menu was perfectly portioned and filling. We ordered biscuits to start and were in love with the buttery flavor and flaky consistency. These are perfectly sized - not too large and you'll still have room for your meal. \\n\\nFor the meal we ordered the baked eggs, Brussels sprouts hash, and the biscuits and gravy. Each dish had excellent flavors but I think the bacon and spice in the Brussels sprouts hash was the real winner. All well priced as well!\", u'Sunshine Co., you had me at \"10 minute wait\" on a WEEKEND for BRUNCH.\\n\\nThere\\'s probably already hundreds of reviews on the Brussel Sprout Hash but damn, that stuff is legit. Who knew bacon and paprika were soul mates with good ol\\' brussel? The bacon fat/bacon really sealed the fate of this dish. It provided enough texture and crunch to make this dish interesting. The paprika made it fun and non-green. Oozing yolk + bacon + bacon fat + savory brussel sprouts + crostini = YUM!\\n\\nIf you like ginger, get the fresh ginger soda. It\\'s seriously fresh and not that store-bought stuff. The candied ginger slice on top was a sweet and delicious treat.\\n\\nService was great. Everyone was attentive and very smiley. The kitchen staff might be on steroids because they bust out dishes like no other.', u\"One of my favorite places to go whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner, winter or Summer or anytime in between. From the waitstaff to the bartenders and the kitchen the vibe has a friendly neighborhood feeling with hearty food options that are pretty fancy despite their price. I've never had a bad time here and I keep coming back for more. Open late with HH right next to BBG and the Brooklyn Museum, wait time are never more than a few mins to be seated either. It's great, see for yourself. \\n\\np.s. Try the caprese salad in a drink (forget the name). Gin, basil, tomato water, balsamic spritz. It's insane\", u\"We came on a slow Monday night. We were barely acknowledged and had to wait a really long time to even order. Other tables had ordered and got their food before we ordered. The staff were simply chatting amongst themselves. The food was delicious, I just don't recommend this place if you have anywhere to be.\", u\"After exploring the Brooklyn Botanical Garden all day we dropped into this place before heading home and I am glad that we did. Finding the place wasn't hard, a local directed us to its location. The outside isn't overwhelming with personality however once you step inside the ambiance combined with the friendly staff makes up for this. I would love to see blooming flowers and maybe ivy outside around their outdoor dining area. \\nOur bartender, Brian, was brilliant with helping me pick out a drink. Walking me through how the various boozy cocktails were created. I finally settled on the Hemmingway Daiquiri which had a a tart taste but was enhanced by the liquor infused juice.\\nI cannot wait to go back during happy hour for more yummy french fries.\", u'Went there for a late night snack.\\n\\nI had the octopus and a glass of wine.\\nWhat a combination!  It was a nice way to wind down.  The food was very good!', u'Food was okay.  Drinks were okay.  Service was fine.  We sat there for a while talking and drinking..  But we ordered drinks as we sat.  Then they came and asked us if we wouldn\\'t mind wrapping up because they had a \"few parties\" in line waiting.  We said of course we would, we aren\\'t savages.  Then as we walk out there are like 4 tables empty, the outside seating is empty, and not one soul was standing there waiting.  \\n\\nWon\\'t be back.', u'The new Parmesan Crusted Chicken by @chefmartita is delicious and moist. The salad on the plate is excellent.'], u'53.Lolita Grand': [u\"This restaurant is a hidden gem on Grand Street in Williamsburg! \\n\\nI've been a few times and the lack of foot traffic is criminal. Some notes about Lolita Grand:\\n\\n1. The cocktails are top notch and made with care by the bartenders.\\n\\n2. Brunch here is fantastic. I've had Lolita Grand's take on a yogurt bowl... it was perfectly refreshing and delicious, a must have for any yogurt lovers :). They also offer a boozy brunch option, although I've never partaken I recall it being a great deal. \\n\\n3. The jerk lollipop chicken wings are some of the best I've ever eaten (and trust me I've eaten a lot of chicken wings).\\n\\n4. The restaurant space itself is open, spacious, and inviting with what I perceive to be a South American (perhaps Brazilian?)  influence. \\n\\n5. Service has always been quick and attentive... which isn't surprising since I've never really been when it was crowded. \\n\\nOne piece of advice... don't order off menu! My roommate and I ordered chicken wings (unsurprisingly not included on brunch menu) and got charged up the wazoo! Overall this place has potential to be great for everything... brunch, dinner, late-night, date spot, etc. just needs to start building up a solid customer base!\", u'A sunday night, we went with some friends to try this restaurant. There was a live convert of Cuban musics it was great. The waitress was really nice and the food was good. we tried the ACP bowl and jerk chicken\\n\\n+\\n- music\\n- waitress\\n\\n-\\n- not a lot of people inside to create at real energy', u\"The interior decorations were ADORABLE. That's what got me through the door, as I was waiting for a brunch reservation down the street and had 45 minutes to kill. I stopped in for a cup of coffee. It was dead on a Sunday at 1:00 pm...not sure if that's standard for them, or if it was just a dead day?\\n\\nThe staff was friendly, but not attentive. It seemed like they were nowhere to be found until we wanted our check. And I paid $6.50 for two luke-warm cups of black coffee. But I can't speak to their food.\\n\\nI would maybe give it another try if a friend wanted to go. Otherwise, I wasn't impressed overall.\", u\"I've been here four or five times in the past few months--always after midnight--and I just wanted to post a review because it is such an appreciated addition to the local scene, and it always comes through. \\n\\nI come here after work if I get out early (bartender in Manhattan), and I second what everyone says about the cocktails...also, their draft/bottle/can selection is really great--deep, not predictable, well-curated. I've had salads, burgers, sandwiches, and empanadas, and everything has been spectacular and I really appreciate that at that hour and after I've gotten out of work. \\n\\n(Nothing feels like spring mix+cherry tomatoes+store-bought/Cisco dressing..everything shows evidence of care, and--even if I am obviously the last customer they are going to have--I never feel shorted or rushed.) \\n\\nI can't recommend this to local night owls/industry folk highly enough.\", u'Nice staff\\nNice decor \\nWent for drinks, tried their remixed pi\\xf1a colada,  it was different from what I am accustomed to. It was pretty good, nice place for a drink with friends. I have not tried the food yet.', u'Came here last night with a friend during Grand Street Restaurant Week. Out of all of the restaurants in the area participating in Restaurant Week, Lolita Grand had the best menu. That paired with the great Yelp reviews made our decision on where to go very easy!\\n\\nI always love trying new spots near me.  Came here @ 6:30 on a Saturday.  The place was pretty empty.  Got a little busier as time went on.  It\\'s so damned cute and adorable in here. Seating is so cozy.  Certain seats give you a nice view of the kitchen area. The decor is new, fresh and bright.  Felt like I was transplanted to someplace totally other than Williamsburg!  Seems like they have a tiny backyard as well which I\\'m not sure if they utilize or not.  \\n\\nAs I mentioned previously, their Restaurant Week menu was huge.  Three courses for only $23 dollars. Can\\'t go wrong there.  It was very hard picking the appetizer and main course because everything sounded amazing.  I started off with the \"Crack\" Dip.  Huge pieces of crostini with a dip that consisted of spring vegetables and ricotta.  They gave this \"Crack\" Dip the proper name because it was addicting!  The crostini was perfectly crunchy to pair with it.  The portion was huge.  For the main course, I got the Cubano Especial.  Cuban sandwich and fries.  Cuban sandwiches are my thing so I know a good one when I have it.  It wasn\\'t the best Cuban I\\'ve ever had, but it was pretty damned good! Fresh ingredients and an interesting twist with the cheddar instead of swiss and pulled pork instead of the regular roast pork.  Came with an incredibly LARGE portion of fries that were extremely fresh and tasty.  Some of the best fries I\\'ve had.  The side of Salsa Verde was soooooooooo good!!  Wanted to drink it all. Was dipping the fries and sandwich in it.  \\n\\nSo, the reason I\\'m taking away one star and not giving it a perfect 5 is that of the service.  It seemed frantic and all over the place. Free soda refills.  They kept refilling our water and soda throughout the night.  Before I got a chance to say no more refills, there they were frantically refilling the drinks. It\\'s nice, but a bit much without asking. Specifically about the soda.  The place was empty, but the servers seemed like they wanted us out of there.  Why I have no idea.  They never took our appetizer plates away.  They kept switching my friend and I\\'s food.  When we were done with dinner she asked us if that would be all. I thought she meant main food wise, but she didn\\'t and brought the check out. We are paying for a three-course meal. Why would you not bring the third course?  They looked super annoyed that we wanted the Tres Leche Cake that we were paying for. We even heard them talking about it. \"Well, they WANT it\". Ugh.  That irritated me.  By the way, the Tres Leche Cake was delicious!  It was topped with rum soaked pineapple. Mmm!  As we got up to leave and said goodnight to our waitress, she just flat out ignored us.  One of the kitchen help saw and was quite embarrassed so he shot us a smile and warm goodnight. Something else that was also off putting.  Since the portions were huge, we left a lot.  They asked if we wanted it to go. We said yes. The waitress comes back with 2 cardboard containers and two plastic bags. Pretty much throws them at us and that was that. We had to bag our own stuff at the table. That was weird.\\n\\nSo, yes, only 4 stars. Besides the service, I enjoyed the food and atmosphere very much.  I definitely will come here again. If the service is different, I\\'ll bring it up to 5 stars. If you enjoy Cuban food with interesting twists that utilize fresh ingredients, I highly recommend Lolita Grand!', u\"Closer to a 3.5 Stars: \\nAll in all, this is a good place to grab drinks that you can also have food at as well. It has a solid drink list, good food, and great decor. I haven't tried the brunch deal though. This is both a good spot for a date night or for grabbing drinks with friends. \\n\\nFood: 3 Stars - The food options here are good and tasty, but nothing mind blowing. Just regular solid food - with very large portion sizes! The Cuban Sandwich  was huge, the Grande burger was a good choice\\n\\nDrinks: 3 Stars Much like the food, their cocktail list is good, they have some good options, but nothing too special and very standard. The Illegal old fashioned was good, and the Pisco queen could of been better. \\n\\nAmbiance/decor: 4 or 5 Stars - beautiful setup and feel. Gives a very intimate vibe that allows you to have a good conversation with whoever you are with, but also could allow for you to meet others. \\n\\nStaffing/Service: I'm going to say  3 here, but this could just be with new employees still getting adjusted. There were a few times when (even with not a large crowd) it would take a while to get someone's attention while some of the wait staff would be waiting. Again - not bad and could simply be new hires adjusting.\", u'Lovely addition to the neighborhood! Service is so sweet and the food is good too. Baja Bowl, empanadas and rounding the meal off with some daiquiris. Two thumbs up.', u\"Amazing new spot! Can't wait to go again. They featured a fantastic singer last night that really set the mood. Decor is gorgeous - historic, rustic and the back area is a perfect spot for a quaint date night. Owners are on site working and so hospitable and warm. The drinks are unique and tasty and all of the small plates we had hit the spot before a night out. Perfect spot to meet, greet, stay all night or pre-game. Thank you so much for everything. I come to the city a couple times a year and this is a must visit.\", u'Came here on a Saturday a little after 12.... STARVING and hungover from way too much to drink the night before. The place was empty and I needed some quick food.... this is NOT the place for quick anything.... considering my wife and I are the only ones here you would think a fast turn around... 30+ minutes for toast with jam... WTF! Currently still waiting on a burger and Cuban sandwich  for about an hour.... yeah not in the mood.. if I could give zero stars I would', u'What a cute place. I love the decor. We started with the chopped empanadas. It had a tasty dipping sauce. I had the jerk chicken plate. It was amazing. It was spicy enough and the portion was huge. I would highly recommend the restaurant.', u\"My homegirl and I was lookin for a bar where we could chill and just chat. Came on a Saturday night and it was oddly empty. Didn't try the food but the drinks... My god. There like 12 a piece and they are smooth but strong. The bartender for the night was very heavy handed. I like this place. Chill vibe\", u\"Hands down some of the best Cuban-food I've had in the area! Came here on recommendation from Dar 525 (owned by the same people). The drinks were phenomenal (Illegal Old Fashioned and Lolita Rita) and the Ropa Vieja was perfectly cooked.\\n\\nThe service is amazing - be sure to check this place out before it gets packed!\", u'Wonderful spot. Cuban food along with other more American and veggie friendly stuff too!', u\"I haven't had a ton of cubano sandwiches in my life, but this was the best one I've had AND it was huge AND it was reasonably priced.\", u'Great ambience and friendly staff. \\nLove the music selection\\n\\nWe went with a large group of people so I was able to try a lot of their menu. \\nThe Baja Bowl and ACP bowl are my favorite entrees. Good balance of greens,veggies and protein. \\nJerk chicken lollipops are amazing. Great flavor and texture. \\nMy favorite cocktails were the spicy margarita and guavacito\\n\\nLolita feels like a tropical getaway at a fraction of the cost!', u'Amazing food & service! The owner Clemente is so warm & friendly and all the severs are so nice. Highly recommend the empanadas, the burger, and guac! So excited to have this new spot in the neighborhood!', u\"I loved the atmosphere. Great decor and music. The drinks were strong and prices weren't bad. Being the foodie I am, I must say I was underwhelmed with the food. The empanadas were ok. I also tried the Jerk wings and my girlfriend tried the Buffalo wings .. not the best. They weren't seasoned well and lacked the punch one expects from spicy wings. I haven't tried their brunch. I'll have to give them another try. I hope I'll have better luck next time because it's such a cute spot.\", u\"I can't speak to the drinks, as we just got food. But honestly, the food was so bad. We got shrimp sofrito with rice. The rice was stale and unevenly cooked. The bacon wrapped plantains were inedible. The were dry with a werid BBQ sauce on them. The wings were fine, neither good nor bad. The kale salad was good. I wanted to like this place because I live across the street, but I'm a little bitter that I just spent my money on food that was so gross.\", u'I really loved flamenco Sunday . In addition to great dancing by aurora Reyes and singing and guitar playing by Basilio students are allowed to participate. There is such great talent ! I loved the ropa vieja and drink selection . This restaurant is conveniently located on the g and l lines and there is a bus from queens that goes there also . I highly recommend'], u'96.Cafe Mogador': [u'One word: \"wow!\" This place really has some good eats. It also has quite a nice atmosphere; dimly lit with plenty of table space and accommodation for bigger groups. I did have to wait around 30 minutes to get in, however, in hindsight it was absolutely worth the wait! \\n\\nBecause it\\'s a Moroccan place, I of course had to order the tagine which is what they\\'re known for. I got the chicken and my date got the lamb. We also got the falafel and the Greek salad as appetizers - both Mediterranean classics and two of my favorite dishes. \\n\\nTo start, the falafels were fantastic - on par with ones I have had in Israel. They were extremely crisp on the outside and soft and flavorful on the inside. They were delightfully green and tasted delicious with the zingy tahini that came alongside.\\n\\nThe Greek salad was pretty standard with two large feta slices on top - perfect to split between 2. \\n\\nOn to the tagine. Both the chicken and the lamb were so fork tender, they fell off the bone at the slightest touch. You also get to pick which sauce you\\'d like with your meat. I went with the chickpea sauce for the chicken and the prune/apricot sauce with the lamb. Both were fantastic, the prune/apricot was particularly good with the lamb as the sweetness balanced the gaminess of the lamb. \\n\\nWould highly recommend this place if you\\'re in Williamsburg and you and your friends enjoy fresh Mediterranean grub!', u'This place was popping on a Saturday night. We waited about an hour for a table for 3, but luckily we were able to kill time at the bar with a tasty drink. My husband had a glass of wine and I enjoyed their \"tequila tippy.\" \\n\\nThe meal I had is what will always stay with me; the most tender lamb shank I\\'ve ever had with the most delicious apricot prune sauce. Prior to being seated, I noticed more than half the place was ordering the lamb shank so I took notice. Alot of people were also ordering the hangar steak dish with fries. \\n\\nMy husband ordered the lamb shank too but opted for the green herb sauce with was savory rather than sweet like mine. I wish I had more of an appetite to try their appetizers and desserts, so there will be plenty of reasons to return!', u'Our server (Aliza I believe her name was) and the wait staff were all very nice here. The food I am sure is very delicious.\\n\\nHowever I had gotten food poisoning after eating from here so I might not be coming back.', u\"My brother and his girlfriend craved Moroccan food last night, so we searched, found Cafe Mogador, and we were happy. \\n\\nFirst, I want to compliment the very attentive serving staff, we were pleased and our water cups were filled frequently. \\n\\nOur mixed mezze plate and the falafel were simply wonderful, and we each had a smile on our face, agreeing that we chose a good spot. I really loved my Moroccan Mint Julep (you have to drink some sort of mint tea at a Moroccan restaurant, am I right?!). Our tagine and bastilla were wonderful, and We really enjoyed our orange cake and panna cotta desserts.\\n\\nThis is definitely a spot I'd like to revisit.\", u'There is a reason this place always has a wait -  It is a WELL run restaurant, with simple yet delicious food.  \\n\\nI highly recommend the babaganoush, and slather that ish on your entire meal.', u'The food was okay. Ordered grilled veggie with zatar and salumi cheese. The quantity was very less and the cheese was way too salty. Lebne along with pita was delicious. For entree we ordered the garlic cilantro paratha-extremely delicious, veggie tangine or whatever - hot and tasted good.', u'VEGAN REVIEW:\\n\\nIf you\\'re vegan or dining with a vegan friend, skip Cafe Mogador (unless you really dislike your vegan companion and want him/her to suffer). Alright, maybe \"suffer\" is a little harsh, but honestly there is nothing here for vegans. \\n\\nAs a long time vegan, I know the drill. A friend invited me to lunch here and asked if it was a good place for me. Before giving the go-ahead, I called in and asked about their vegan options from the weekend lunch menu which I was told there were \"many\", including falafel salad, the veggie cous cous subbed with rice (bc the cous cous is cooked with butter), etc. \\nWhen we arrived and were seated, none of the things I was told were vegan were on the menu! I was seriously confused but I ordered the only thing that could be made vegan - the Greek salad ... hold the feta AND croutons. The waitress gave me a \"wtf\" look and trust me, I felt the same way as I was ordering. I was ordering the most basic salad ever.\\n\\nMy plate of leaves come drenched in dressing (which I can live with) and covered in raw onions. There were 4 olives on the plate and they were not pitted so I had to awkwardly spit out the pits as I was conversing with this friend who I had not seen in years. Oh, and it was a $13 salad. I think it\\'s safe to say that no one - vegan or not - should order this ridiculously priced plate of leaves.\\n\\nOn top of the food issue, the people who work here are not very friendly. I read some other yelp reviews about the hostess at the entrance of the restaurant and I agree - she\\'s not a very welcoming hostess. If I was dining alone, I would have walked out right after my interaction with her. All in all, I wouldn\\'t recommend this spot to vegans and am seriously disappointed.', u'Discovered this cute Moroccan and Mediterranean restaurant while around the area in Williamsburg.\\n\\nWe had ordered the mixed platter, which contained hummus and salad along with pita bread for dipping. The pita bread was fresh out of the oven and still hot when served. It was really good! We also ordered the lamb and chicken as well, which was a pretty large dish so I would highly recommend sharing it.', u\"An old classic, the food is excellent here and you really can't go wrong. \\n\\nIt's not quite as authentic as you'd like, but for New York, it does the job. The service is really quite exceptional here as well. \\n\\nA must visit.\", u\"This is my bf's favorite restaurant and i cant agree more with him on that. there is always a wait so we try to go there as late as we can so we dont have to. Even at 930-10, there is still a short wait. They have a bar but its usually packed as well. We dont mind the wait though, the food is really exceptional and we dont go often. Its not our typical casual dinner spot, we prob come here once every 2-3 months or special occasions. This is a great spot for a date =)\\n\\n \\n\\nTheir menu isnt that big, but everything is so good. They have daily specials that change seasonally. We usually get their mixed platter as an app, that hummus is like amazing. If you dont like hummus, you will after having it cafe mogador. You need to try their tangines (they are known for their tangines). My favorite is the Casablanca. \\n\\n \\n\\nI dont find their food heavy or greasy by any means, its just so flavorful that you want to keep eating until you burst. Their portions are huge either, its just the right portion.You want to leave satisfied with your meal and not fall into a food coma afterwards.\", u\"This is a great multifaceted gem good for having a date or meeting up with friends for a good meal and drinks before a night out in the trendy parts of Brooklyn. \\n\\nThe menu is well designed to initiate the casual diner into the world of Moroccan cuisine and goes to pains to contextualize the different dishes by listing out the individual ingredients as well as having the servers be well versed in describing each different dish and making suggestions.\\n\\nThe interior is cozy and inviting with exposed brick, creating a very francophone atmosphere. Their wine selection is well thought-out and offers several reasonably priced options. This is definitely a place where you'll want to share a bottle or two of wine with your friends!\\n\\nOn our most recent visit they had a special duck which was delicious. I can't wait to return to try the chicken tagine, a signature Morrocan dish.\", u\"Cafe Magador is by far the best meal and waitstaff I experienced during our spring break Brooklyn/NYC vacation! My husband actually found this gem online and I am so grateful (even though he knows picking restaurants is my bailiwick). \\n\\nLocated in the hipster Brooklyn neighborhood that is Williamsburg, this place opened in 1983 and has a following. We got a table for 3 quickly at 10 am for Saturday brunch. Good thing too because shortly after the line with all the beautiful, young people (with money my poor 20something son added) trailed out the door. \\n\\nBefore I get to the food, let me just say this place had ambience, complete with mosaic tiles in the bathroom. Mirrors, china and a lovely bar as the centerpiece. I seem to recall a patio in back too but could be mistaken. The staff was by far some the most young professionals in service I have encountered. They were friendly and respectful even though it was clear we were not part of the beautiful set nor did we have cute Williamsburg babies in tow. \\n\\nSo, the food. I will let the pictures speak for themselves but the sides of home fries were crispy and fresh. We each had an egg dish. I loved mine which included a semi-spicy tomato Moroccan sauce. Other sides which make this place unique include hummus, pita bread, tabouli, and Arabic salad. I also splurged on a cup of the rich Turkish coffee - highly recommended! Be sure to swirl the grounds when you are done. I don't know how to read them but it's pretty. \\n\\nDefinitely add this to your eating list if you get across the bridge to Brooklyn. Great shopping and parks too.\", u\"Cafe Mogador is amazing on every level. The food is fantastic, the ambiance is lovely, the service is good, and its a NYC icon that has thrived for over 3 decades. First opened in 1983 in the East Village, it quickly became an integral part of the neighborhood - the place to go, eat, people watch, and socialize. Serving Moroccan-inspired food, it was as exotic and alluring for others as it was just the local spot for the East Village citizens. It eventually opened up another location in Williamsburg, which serves the same menu in a very similar setting and has remained very true to its original essence. Cafe Mogador adheres to the concept of if it ain't broke don't fix it. And it ain't broke.\\n\\nRarely will you find a time when Cafe Mogador isn't bustling. It's open from morning until late night, serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Though it's a very popular brunch destination, I cannot recommend dinner highly enough. There's scarcely a thing on the menu that I don't want to eat. And I want to eat a boatload of it. I want to eat everything and then more of everything. In true Moroccan form, you'll find three main types of dishes: tagines, couscous dishes, and mezzes. There's nothing not worth getting, so I don't know maybe save up your paycheck, go with a group of 10 people, and order one of everything?\\n\\nIn seriousness, I can't recommend the tagines highly enough. They have a chicken and a lamb shank on their daily menu, but the specials often include a vegetable tagine. This comes highly recommended and is so delicious. It comes with an array of beautiful vegetables: crispy leeks, carrots, green beans, potatoes, okra, onions, zucchini, and peas. In a really lovely, delicate broth. And it's served with herbed couscous on the side. The couscous is so good, not dry, flavorful, and super light. The portion it is served with may be enough for some, but I can't stop until I've had about the size of my face, so I'd recommend getting an extra couscous on the side. \\n\\nYou may be wondering what the difference between the tagines and the couscous dishes are. After all, you have chicken, lamb, veggie, and merguez options for both. Other than the ratio of couscous to protein/veg (couscous dishes have more couscous), in a tagine, the protein/veg is cooked and served separately in a broth, for you to combine with couscous as you please. In a tagine, the star is the protein/veg and you can an ample amount of it. You could even forgo the couscous altogether (but you'd be crazy to do that). The couscous dish, on the other hand, comes with the couscous and protein/veg served together, with the couscous on bottom and the broth having fully soaked into it. You can't really go wrong, but I prefer the tagine.\\n\\nThe mezzes are also not to be missed. As a person who rarely orders mezzes (they are often mediocre, over priced, and detract from the meal itself), I cannot pass them up at Cafe Mogador. The two I highly recommend are the spicy carrots and the cucumber yogurt, served with their homemade naan. It's pretty much I-want-to-eat-my-face-off good. Anyway, I think I've made the point. You just have to go. And if there's a wait, which there likely will be, then just wait. You'll be super happy you did.\", u\"Very happy with our dinner wedding anniversary shenanigans. Servers and the people are very friendly here and want you to have the best experience with Mediterranean food... Having been so many Arabic cuisine we ordered our usual Lamb Shank and rice. \\n\\nLet me tell y'all, Cafe Mogador does not disappoint with quality, quantity or their mouthwatering flavors. We were left drooling for more even after the somewhat heavy lamb shank meal. \\n\\n\\nWe had a free champagne drink courtesy of the restaurant for our anniversary, and may importantly a delicious floorless almond cake to end the night. Overall a Great experience at Williamsburg... Will be back :)\", u\"Apparently transphobic folk are welcomed here. \\n\\nTonight: Seating at the bar portion, tall white man makes transphobic remarks towards transwoman. Her friend calls him out on it. An argument ensues, and man gets extremely aggressive (he's probably twice as big as the women), threatening them. \\n\\nAfter altercation - where people legitimately worry the guy is going to start throwing punches - both women leave crying. \\n\\nGuy stays, barman keeps serving him, his name gets pumped up on the waitlist to get a table (probably in hopes of getting him out sooner). Patrons look in disbelief. \\n\\nSHAME. ON. YOU. \\n\\nYes. This is the first time I've written a Yelp review. It was that unbelievable a scene.\", u'I\\'m glad to have finally got the chance to try this place! One of my good friends lives in East Williamsburg and she always snapchats this place so obviously I was eager to try it! We went here to \"work from home.\" This place has wifi! Amazing!\\n\\nThe interior of this place is a dream. Very hipster, very aesthetic. She said before you would be able to sit in the garden, but no longer could. 4 of us ate here and we were sat right away. We ordered some Moroccan mint tea with half sweetness. It was super good. 3 out of the 4 of us got the Moroccan eggs and 1 of us got the french toast. The tomato sauce was suuuuper good and the pita was super fresh. Eggs were cooked to perfection. The service was amazing!\\n\\nI would definitely come back to try their other dishes but this place was a delight. You guys really know what you\\'re doing!', u\"My wife and I spend our honeymoon in Morocco and wanted to find a Moroccan place to eat at for our anniversary this year. Cafe Mogador was well recommended by our friends and we were not disappointed. The interior is an adorable cafe setting with a full bar as well, not unlike those which are so common in Morocco proper. There are only a few large tables and the seating is pretty tight in the main area so if you're uncomfortable being close to others or have a large group you may want to call ahead to see what is available. There is also a lovely garden area in the back where you can sit and eat but it was closed for renovations when we visited.\\n\\nAs far as our first-hand experience with Moroccan cuisine goes, this spot certainly delivered on flavor and diversity. The menu was filled with authentic Moroccan delicacies and everything we ordered was great. My wife had the chicken tagine, I had the sausages with roasted vegetables, and we both shared the hummus appetizer and Moroccan sweet tea. Our only small disappointment was that the tagine was not actually served in a tagine (as it would have been in Morocco. If you are unfamiliar, a Tagine is a Teepee-shaped cooking pot typically made of clay which a dinner is baked in. The top is removed for serving. Regardless, this was a small detail and the food inside was quite enjoyable.\\n\\nService was attentive and friendly. All-around we had a great time and would return. Be advised that if you come here and there is a wait, the only real standing room is outside.\", u'The food is sumptuous  My husband and I had the chicken tagine and bastilla. Also love the vibe. It has a nice environment.', u\"Friends and I initially wanted to go to House of Small Wonders for brunch, but the wait was ridiculous, so we stumbled here instead - thank god we did, because this place is just as wonderful...\\n\\nThe seating in the back reminds me of an Egyptian movie with magic carpets, exotic dishes, lush plants & cushions, and a beautiful stream of light to add to it all. I wasn't able to sit here because of peak brunch hours, but next time I will be back and eating in that spot :).\\n\\nAs for the food, it was flavorful and extremely filling. It was my first time drinking Turkish coffee and I highly recommend it for its novelty and flavor. It is sweet, strong, and a taste you won't be able to find easily. The hummus here is 10/10, and although a lot of dishes here are very appealing, you won't go wrong with any dish that includes hummus in it (get the Middle Eastern eggs!!). I ordered the Halumi Eggs and got a hefty chunk of cheese - certainly good for cheese lovers like me! \\n\\nThinking that what I ordered wasn't enough, and because I am a meat lover, I ordered the sausage which is good to share between 2. It wasn't necessary and out of this world, so one entree should be more than enough! Staff here were extremely accommodating and friendly, and did not make me feel like a total Middle Eastern nub since it was my first time trying this cuisine. They helped my party of 6 move over to a bigger table just as it was about to get busy.\", u\"We came here for dinner on a Saturday night and the restaurant was packed! The wait was ridiculous but somehow the food God's were in our favor and the 5 other parties of 2 weren't there! I ordered the small tandoor chicken and my friend had the lamb tagine and both were delicious! Mine was easily an 8/10 and my friends lamb was falling off the bone (nom)\\n\\n I'm a sucker for atmosphere and I really love the interior! Will absolutely be back!\"], u'20.Poquito Picante': [u\"This place is a hidden gem in Brooklyn. We found it on Open table and could not be any happier. We started off with the signature drink Poquito Picante. It was the perfect combination of Gin, cilantro, lime juice & Jalape\\xf1o. It was an excellent start to a authentic Mexican dinner. \\n\\nOur entrees were both chicken enchiladas. My husband had the Rojas sauce and I had the verde. Both of the sauces were homemade and you could tell, full of fresh flavors. They were very different but both amazing! The dinner also came with sliced avocados, radishes, feta and topped with sour cream. The 3 enchiladas were prepared to perfection! \\n\\nThis Mexican restaurant was hands down the best we have ever had. We can't wait to bring our family and friends here!\", u'Poquito Picante is the newest addition to the neighborhood, and it sure is a welcome one!\\n\\nThey have an extensive menu of Mexican favorites, and their cocktails are a cool $12.\\n\\nOrder the queso fundido with chorizo because it is damn good. And instead of corn or plantain chips, they give you tortillas as a side, so you can basically make mini quesadillas.\\n\\nFor tacos, we shared the al pastor and the campechanos (chorizo + carnitas). The tacos were delicious. So good that I actually returned during Atlantic Antic and had their carnitas and suadero (brisket) tacos again! \\n\\nLike most of the restaurants on the north side of Atlantic, they have backyard space as well, but we sat at the bar.\\n\\nSpeaking of, special shout out to Octavio, who was running the bar by himself and also took care of us since we sat at the bar. He was super busy all night, but made sure we got everything we needed!\\n\\nDefinitely looking forward to coming back!', u\"When guacamole is served six inches atop the brim of your bowl, you know you've just landed at the $$$$$$ Mexican spot. \\n\\nI only got to try the enchilada and the guacamole with chips here and both were divine. The enchilada is full of flavor, is juicy, saucy and everything your palette could hope for all at once.\\n\\nSO good - I highly recommend.\", u\"My friend and I came here on a Saturday around 11pm. Guess what.. they were still serving food! \\n\\nWe got the shrimp tacos and chicken quesadilla. The chicken quesadilla looked really different and small however it was so good, we both enjoyed it. \\n\\nThe shrimp tacos are a bit spicy but so well seasoned. Really delish! \\n\\nThe staff was nice. Two guys by the bar didn't really do anything expect stand there while one waited on the tables and did everything .. basically. \\n\\nThe backyard area is very cute and def great for a warm day. \\nThe menu isn't very large but the bar is fully stocked. I found the prices to be a bit much but the food was delicious so quality over quantity all day.\", u\"I always start with the guac when I try a new Mexican spot, and I may be a bit of a guac snob but I have to doctor up the dip every time (no one adds lime or cilantro anymore). The guac at PP was absolutely delicious! I'm not a vegetarian, but I shared both the veggie tacos and enchiladas which were amazing. I would come back just for drinks and the guac, though our meal was pretty good as well. The space is limited, so I recommend sitting in the yard.\", u\"This is the best Mexican food I have ever had! I went the last night and everything was delicious from the guacamole to the steak tacos. I highly recommend everything on the menu the margarita was the best I ever had. I can't wait to go back.\", u'Came here for dinner with my husband and it was very good!  The loco corn was so delicious- I really enjoyed the kick it had to it that I was not expecting!  The shrimp tacos were also very good- who would have thought- chipotle works so well with shrimp!\\n\\nTheir liquor license is still pending but once it is approved I bet this place will become a neighborhood go to.\\n\\nThere was no wait to be seated and the staff are extremely attentive. \\n\\nIt looks like they have a good brunch menu as well- we will be definitely coming back!', u'Best Mexican restaurant in the area! Tacos al\\nPastor and Enchiladas were very flavorful. Drinks were good too.', u\"We have been waiting over an hour for some tacos. They're out of guac. And mezcal. Nobody else has been served yet either. In the whole place. Hey... order just showed. But it's not our food. Going great so far. Maybe skip this place.\", u\"Every time we order from these guys it's a hassle. Tonight, it's been an hour & a half after ordering and still nothing. Tried calling them back several times but phone just rings off the hook. The charged my credit card so I know order went through.\\n\\nOnly reason I keep ordering from them is that the food is pretty good and we need more food like this in the neighborhood. 4 or 5 star food. 0 star experience.\", u'Shrimp tacos come with the best chipotle sauce ever. Everything tastes great here. And this is one of those rare places that still makes a straight-up margarita (or you can order on the rocks), not that slushy icy thing you get at most places.', u\"I went here last night and color me impressed!  The three margaritas they are testing out are OUTSTANDING and the quality of the dishes was on par.  For our appetizer, I was in the mood for something heart attack inducing, so we ordered the chorizo queso fundido and it was delicious.  For the main courses we went with the chicken chiles rellenos (very solid) and the pollo a la braza (so flavorful).  \\n\\nThe service was some of the best I've had in recent memory and I am already looking forward to returning.  I would encourage others in the neighborhood to stop by!  You won't be disappointed.\", u'A little hidden treasure in Brooklyn. The scenery in the back is quaint and nice. The food is GREAT! I ordered the best shrimp tacos ever, my wife had a delicious quesadilla, or friends had carne asada and we all were thoroughly satisfied. Planning to return when we come back to NYC.', u\"A hidden jewel. One of the best Mexican/TexMex restaurants I have been to in the Northeast. The chef's Oaxacan style shines through dishes like Chili Relenos. The salsa trio is to die for...literally with the Rojo style harbenero salsa. Their signature (and namesake) cocktail is world class...a delicate balance of spicy and sweet. As an aside, yes they do have a liquor license so those holding off on going need not worry anymore. All and all, this is a must visit. And to top it all...the wait staff was extremely hospitable. It made all the difference.\", u'Really amazing guacamole!  If you like guacamole, you must try it here. \\nOutdoor seating area in the back was very cute and cozy. My toddler enjoyed walking around the yard, which kept him busy most of the night. \\nOur host was a gem. Super sweet and accommodating. Rating is 4 stars b/c we had a time limit placed on our table without advanced notice.', u\"Great new addition to the neighborhood. It's hard enough to find late night eats around here, much less gourmet tacos! The Shrimp\\u200b tacos were off the hook, and definitely gonna try the others next time, or come back for brunch\\n\\nArtemio is a good host, and has opened a lot of bars around the city, so I expect once their drink program starts it will be margaritas all night long.\", u\"This place is great! There was only one waiter so there was a bit of a wait to be attended, but he was very nice and attentive(didn't catch his name) Had dinner out in the backyard, very cute and chill ambiance! The margaritas were good and strong, guac was delish, and I had the veggie enchiladas which were sooo good:) I would def come here again and recommended this place!\", u'Amazing Mexican food and great drinks mixed by the extremely friendly bartender. We tried the Poquito Picante tacos, the al pastor tacos, the both corn options and the guacamole. Everything was excellent!', u'My husband and I enjoyed our experience in Poquito Picante. We enjoyed the delicious meal and its presentation. The service and ambience were quite pleasant. We ordered guacamole, red snapper and shrimp tacos. All of the dishes were amazing!', u\"I was craving tacos the last few nights and like to check out new spots in the area...\\n\\nCame across Poquito Picante and they did not disappoint! It's currently BYOB but they plan to have a full bar soon (can't wait for the margaritas)!! \\n\\nFor food I ordered an elote and the shrimp tacos. VERY delicious!! The elote had a nice char and subtle heat to it. I also nibbled on some chips and salsa as I waited for the food, and my bf with bodega beers, to arrive. I love a place that has fresh, warm chips and great salsas. \\n\\nDefinitely gonna come back for brunch and to try one of the specials plates and Al Pastor tacos!!\"], u'157.Milk And Roses': [u\"Milk and Roses is somewhat isolated on a lonesome stretch of Manhattan Ave, but worth the trip, as it is one of the coziest bar/restaurants I've ever seen! Other reviewers have pointed out the books and piano, which are very charming. It feels like an Italian cafe got mixed up with an antique store and someone's living room. There are a lot of candles twinkling on the tables and fairy lights in the garden. It was a little chilly when I came here for drinks, but the outdoor garden area looks so nice, a very tranquil and photogenic dining spot. \\n\\nBesides the ambiance, the staff were all very friendly and relaxed. This is especially nice since the place is so intimate, it feels like you're sharing the experience with the other diners and servers as well. \\n\\nThey have a modest selection of imported wine and beer, seems to be focused on cocktails. There are some unique options, including a creme brulee drink. We looked over the menu, hoping to get a light snack to share, but we weren't too excited about the options, so decided not to order food. They don't have any appetizers or bar snacks, just meat-heavy entrees and a variety of salads. What they lack in food, the atmosphere more than compensates. \\n\\nAs others have noted, Milk and Roses is cash only and not cheap, so be sure to bring some bills.\", u'I was looking forward to this restaurant due to the good reviews and when I arrived the ambience was very promising, but it was all down hill from there. I ordered the seafood stew, which I found a piece of plastic in that I could have choked on. When I told the waitress this she joked about it but offered no apology and did not offer to comp anything on our bill.\\n\\nBeyond the piece of plastic, the dish itself tasted bland and I later felt stomach pains caused by it. My friend ordered the chicken and was equally disappointed due to it being very dry and bland.\\n\\nI will not be going back here due to the poor service and the lack of care and flavor put into my meal.', u\"A friend and I dropped by for a drink on a pleasant Thursday afternoon, and I'm a fan!\\n\\nOpting to sit in their garden, we each enjoyed a Boysenberry Blues and glasses of water under beautiful late summer foliage.\\n\\nFurthermore, the service was friendly.\", u\"We had our first brunch here. The outside garden is magical. \\nThey had a decaf coffee for me and a delicious Milk and Roses cocktail for my partner. \\nWe wanted to have a light brunch. Fortunately, everything on the menu looked rather small and light. \\nI got two eggs in English muffin and my partner got smoked salmon with asparagus. My dish was great, it came with a side salad and a pickle. The Smoked salmon dish was smaller. It came with one runny egg in a shell and crostini and a side salad. There was no spoon to eat the egg or perhaps there is another way to eat that dish. We didn't know. \\nThe staff was pleasant as usual.\", u\"Warning - **Cash Only**\\n\\nIf you need a place for an intimate/romantic setting, this is THEE place. Friendly staff and dope setup. Can't find much places with couches and booths in NY these days. Backyard is nice and big with seating for big groups. Parking is easy breezy. Came here only for cocktails which were mediocre. Can't wait to try their food next time.\", u\"It wasn't a hot summer so I went to backyard for lunch. Although there were alot of people in the garden, it didn't look too crowed thanks to the spacious space. I had, chicken and pancake, Italian style Shasuka and ravioli and shared them with my friends. Food are ok, not bad not too good. But I liked them because they were less salty then other places in NYC. \\n\\nOne more thing; CASH ONLY.\", u\"I love love love Greenpoint!!!! Everything here is all locals and great tasting food and drinks. Here the service is perfect and the ambiance is even better. Cocktails could be a little stronger but that's just me. The employees are super personal and helpful. Order the pan seared octopus and Brussel Sprouts with bacon. AHHHH PERFECT!!\", u\"I live in Harlem. My best friend lives in Astoria. Neither of us just-so-happen to find ourselves in Brooklyn, but we still choose to meet up at Milk & Roses time and again because it's as close to perfection we've found in this city. It's a little pricey and very out of the way if you don't live or work in the area, but the ambience is everything. It's dark and cozy without feeling dingy. It's classy but understated. It's small but not tight. It's a cafe but also a bar, and transitions smoothly into happy hour in the late afternoon. There's a book-lined interior, and also a back garden. \\n\\nBring a book, or a laptop, or your BFF, or a date. But don't tell too many people because I'd hate to see this spot get busy; the calm is half its appeal!\", u'After many other restaurant ideas got rejected, I had to pull this from my bookmarked of gems. As expected, it delivered!\\n\\nA candlelit dinner surrounded by a collection of books, it delivers on the charm and makes a great date or dinner party. There is a backyard/garden as well for the summer.  There were a few moments of \"wow\" in regards to the food. Salmon tartare was fresh and well balanced with the other ingredients that it was simply delicious. It\\'s a must reorder on my list. I had the cod as my entree. The cod was surprisingly lighter than anticipated. While the cod wasn\\'t as filling, the food was very tasteful.\\n\\n*This is a cash only place, but there is an ATM machine in the back*', u'Milk and Roses is a wonderful romantic dining experience in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. We were there for a holiday dinner among friends. I loved the candle lit dinner, the old books lining the wall and books being stored with the alcohol in the bar. Our hilarious waiter/manager who kept joking us, especially about one side that never came. \\n\\nThe best dishes were juicy, cilantro mixed salmon tartar, the hearty creamy parsnip and potatoe based beef stew and the crisped medium rare duck breast. The duck sat on top of this bed of rich farro, red currents and roasted pine nuts. This mixture was harmoniously made so they melded in your mouth as a crisp crunch and sweet sour nuttiness. It was amazing! \\n\\nThe crispy cod was not filling for a lot of my dining companions but it was tender. The bone marrow appetizer was disappointingly small (one half of a bone sliced lengthwise for $15).\\nThe drinks were very affordable: $3 green tea, $6 for a beer and a shot. Whereas the food prices varied.\\n\\nThey had a beautifully lit backyard with picnic tables in the back for warmer days of brunching. \\nThe manager was kind enough to let us take our group photo in the back! Thanks! We will be back (when its warmer).', u\"::CASH ONLY:: I was in the Greenpoint area looking for dinner and Milk and Roses came up as a viable option. Milk and Roses has a striking interior, with an off-key piano, Chesterfield couches, and dusty bookshelves lining the walls. However, on the warm Friday night I came, most guests were directed to the backyard, adorned by a blossoming cherry tree.\\n\\nService was admittedly slow that night. There was really only one person taking food orders (and clearing plates and filling water, it seemed like), so everything felt like it took a while.\\n\\nThe cocktail menu is interesting and on point - they are all $12, and I got the Milk and Roses, which had pretty floral adornments as well. For food, I got the chicken liver pate. It wasn't anything special, but it was serviceable. The bread was toasted crisp and the pate spread just fine. I had a bite of my friend's lamb entree and I thought it was delicious. I was less impressed by their peach (?) bread pudding type dessert - soggy with no variation in texture to break up the mush.\\n\\nAnyhow, it appears that the menu is seasonal (or that the website is outdated), so I wouldn't mind stopping by if I happened to be in the area.\", u\"Great garden, delicious food. Their cocktails weren't too sugar-heavy as they sometimes are. I'm also a sucker for libraries, so the interior of this place was right up my alley.\\n\\nThe garden was great, not just a rectangle outside with a few potted plants here and there, it's really overgrown and broken up in a gorgeous romantic way. Little tables under trees, hidden behind trellises... I would bring a romantic date here and if I had a birthday in the summer I would also have a party here.\", u\"I really wanted to love Milk and Roses after reading wonderful reviews about it here, but I had such a bad experience here today.\\n\\nMy friend and I came for brunch around 1:45pm (sunday). Luckily, we did not have to wait for a table and got to sit outside in the garden. We were able to order fast (smoked salmon omelette and french toast), but it took us over an hour to get our food. We were not served water for over an hour as well (despite the waitresses coming over multiple times to check on us and reassuring us the food will be out shortly, which were all lies). We were offered complimentary mimosas or coffee for the long wait (nice of them to do).\\n\\nI'm so confused how a simple omelette and french toast could take over an hour to prepare. There were other tables, but the wait was ridiculous. The waitress also told us the side of bacon we ordered would be on the house, but we ended up getting charged for it anyways.\\n\\nYes, the garden and decor is lovely, but I left not knowing if the food was good because I was starving or it's subpar and not worth revisiting.\", u\"Oh my gawd this place is delightful. \\n\\nMy bestie brought me here because I'm a librarian and I love books and hidden gardens. We stepped through the main dining area of bookcases and old leather seating to the garden oasis in the back. It's like you've escaped and found a secret garden. No, it's like you entered Francis Hodgen's Burnett's novel paradise. \\n\\nAn adorable Brit was our waitress, and she was very attentive to our mimosas (they were bottomless - which was provided a perfect sleepy buzz for my bus ride home to Boston). Even after we'd paid the check, she and her colleague maid sure our glasses were filled.\\n\\nI got the chicken and waffles, which may have been my best brunch choice yet. The chicken was crispy, tender, and succulent, and the waffles were supple and a sweet counterpoint. They also serve coffee with their brunch deal - and it's a giant americano that won't leave you wanting for caffeine. \\n\\nIf I lived in Brooklyn, I would take up permanent residence in the back on Sundays. Go forth and brunch happily Brooklynites!\", u\"My girlfriend was annoying me to go to Milk and Roses for months and we finally made the trip out to Greenpoint to have brunch in their outdoor garden. Loved the vibe here and the outdoor space is definitely a rare find, even for Brooklyn...felt like we were transported to a foreign country.\\nThe cuisine is stated as southern Italian but there's also some French influence. I liked the fact that everything is locally sourced and mostly organic. Also the capuccino was perfectly made.\\n\\nStarters:\\nBombolne: fluffy but rich, unfilled \\n\\nMains:\\nCroque Madame: their bread is DELICIOUS so definitely get this or one of their other sandwiches to try\\nPasta with chicory and fava beans: they were out of fava beans but still went with this and it was perfect for a summer day. Very refreshing\", u\"I went here on Saturday night, and I'm now completely obsessed with this place. Upon walking in, they were super friendly and offered us the best seat on the big couch. It was the most comfortable I've ever been at a bar. I absolutely loved the decor in here too! And it was a nice volume inside, as opposed to most other bars that are so loud on a Saturday night.\\n\\nI am still thinking about the cocktail I had two days later. If you go here, you have to get the Apple Pie drink. It's incredible, and the whipped cream really makes it. It's the most unique drink I've ever tried. And the rest of their cocktail menu looks amazing too. My boyfriend had the Spicy Sailor cocktail, and it was delicious. I wish that I could have tried one of everything, but I'll definitely be back soon!\", u'Delicious Pana Cotta, extremely romantic back yard and great cocktails!  Great place for romantic date night!', u'Good place for a drink, maybe during happy hour when the prices are sane, but the food is terrible. We had a vegetable risotto for $24 that tastes like absolutely nothing.', u\"Absolutely adorrrrable little cafe - luckily we went just before the cold hit so we were able to sit outside in the patio. \\n\\nI had what I believe was the best french toast I've ever had in my life! I very rarely order sweet breakfasts cuz I feel like it's a treat (even though I eat sweets all the time, I know my logic is crazy) BUT! I am so glad I did! \\n\\nMy sister had a sandwich that she really liked as well. \\n\\nOnly downside was that someone else was smoking in the outdoor seating - worst thing for a food lover trying to enjoy their food!\", u'Incredible service, fantastic food, and a beautiful backyard. Perfect summer dinner spot.'], u'114.Mayfield': [u\"After doing an extremely grueling boot camp in the morning with my two roomies, we decided to treat ourselves to a hearty delicious brunch at mayfield. I love franklin Ave and the new storefronts that makes it a foodie paradise. \\n\\nWe got seated immediately for three which is unusually heard of during Saturday brunch. After weighing out the pros/cons of what we wanted to eat, we decided on our selection. \\n\\nFun fact: their orange juice is like crack. It's freshly squeezed don't know where they got their oranges from but wow!! \\n\\nMy kale salad was what I needed the crunch from the apples and the nuts complimented the ricotta cheese and the fried egg and the yolk running through as a secondary dressing was great!! Plus the side of smoked salmon I needed for a protein refuel!\\n\\nSince today was a good day we sat back in their patio and they have a huge sun guard so it was kept cool!\\n\\nMy friends got the shrimp and grits and the smoked salmon omelette. They were heartily satisfied. Can't wait to go back. I'm so glad to call this my neighborhood spot!\", u\"This place is a hit AND miss for me. I love the kale salad and some of their other things are okay but there are a few things that need fixing:\\nI've gotten the fried oysters twice and both times have thrown up because of it--so I learned my lesson there lol. \\nThen I got the Tongue hash and I think that was it for me and Mayfield. I've been a local and come here very often and that dish killed it for me. The tongue was so undercooked that it was disgusting. I even swapped plates with my husband and he couldn't stomach it. So--Avoid that plate. They still charged us for it even though the cute server with bangs was told that none of us liked it or could even manage to eat it. This server is great at selling but if someone seems hesitant about tongue--you should probably suggest another meal. \\nOn another occasion I ordered two coffees. They brought us a single French press that filled each cup less than halfway--Then they charged us 8 dollars for what was basically a single cup of coffee. What the actual fuck. \\nSo--get the kale salad and an Albari\\xf1o and you'll be happy. But don't toy with their attempts at fine dining. They fail there--the steak is great though. Tiny tiny oysters. Hahaha. This place got me feeling a lot but I definitely am not coming back much more--except for that damn good salad.\", u'Go ahead.  SPLURGE.  Your tummy will thank you!\\n\\nI came for happy hour and ordered the oysters on a half shell for $1, a few cocktails, and then got TKO, which was delish and boozy with that spicy kick, and then the 1/2 sized mushroom ravioli and steak tartare. \\n\\nOysters, were just SO. GOOD. Fresh, well shucked with the usual accompaniments, and, unlike some places where they serve second rate oysters for happy hour, these were crisp, clean and obviously freshly prepped to serve.  \\n\\nMushroom Ravioli: Do you ever CRAVE a well made, fresh ravioli swimming in a delectable sauce and finished off with the right touch of cheese and seasoning?  This dish delivers all of that and more.  Oh my goodness.  I had to stop myself from licking the plate the sauce was so good!  A woody, savory, not overly salted and creamy mushroom sauce coats the perfectly al dente ravioli stuffed with a creamy filling and accompanied by wild mushrooms for an extra texture.  I have had DREAMS about this ravioli.  NOTHING compares to it.  My only wish was that I would have ordered the full size rather than the half!\\n\\nSteak Tartare: Equally delish.  It was a good portion size and came with a properly dressed (not soggy, or skimping on the vinaigrette)  green salad, quail egg to add to the creaminess of the tartare and a side of horseradish yogurt for that tart/funk to round off the dish.  \\n\\nThis is and will continue to be my go to place for any visitors or anyone who asks where to go for a delicious meal. The service was impeccable, ambiance perfect, and it was the perfect dinner to a rainy, miserly night.', u'Came to Mayfield for my Birthday because I heard they have a really good crudo. Sadly it was no longer on the menu but I still had a great time. \\n\\nThe whole restaurant is has a very warm feel from the dim lights natural wood tables and exposed brick. It feels very much like a contemporary romantic America Restaurant. \\n\\nAnd thats what it is. I really liked the menu even though because of dietary restrictions to nuts and pork about half the menu was off limits for me. The kitchen would have been happy to make changes but sometimes substitutions change the whole dynamic of a dish. \\n\\nI ended up having the fried oysters to start which were the best I have ever have. Other restaurants fried oysters are sometimes still slimy but these were crunchy and served with smoked salmon over some kind of slaw. \\n\\nFor an entree I had the trout which was honestly pretty disappointing. They de-boned it like experts but the flavor was a bit on dimensional. It was salty and between the pan searing and the fried fingerling potatoes it was a bit oily. I wish there was a fresh or vegetable component added to the dish. That would have taken it up a notch for me. \\n\\nAll in all it was still a nice dinner and the service and drinks were spectacular. I will definitely be back especially when the crudo is back on the menu.', u'Mayfield was a nice place with well done food. I had the House Made Tagliatelle and the fried Oysters and I was very happy with both. The flavorful bourbon cocktail  was icing on the cake. I liked the environment (even though I was sweating down my back ) and the staff were very kind, helpful, and accommodating. I would gladly come back here if ever I was hungry  near Franklin again.', u'Easily one of my favorite restaurants in the entire city. Atmosphere, great food, awesome cocktails, happy hour, and lucky for me its close to home. Its one of those spots you almost dont want to tell people about because you just want to savor it all for yourself and ensure you never have to wait long on a table. Although, if you come on a Friday/Saturday night you will surely have a wait a bit. Bottom line, Ive tried almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed.', u\"The atmosphere at Mayfield is gorgeous.  It's a nice place to have an intimate dinner with a date or a fanciful happy hour with a girlfriend that turns into a decadent dining experience. I experienced the latter.\\n\\nMy cousin arrived a little late, so I got a drink and was reading a book.  This place has a casual-upscale vibe.  I could see how someone could be a regular here, but it's decor is so classically beautiful that it feels like you're somewhere else...  Anyway, my point is that I read a book and the staff didn't make me feel awkward for doing something non-food related as I waited for my guest.  While I was reading, I ordered a drink and a few oysters to get started.\\n\\nWe both love oysters, so that oyster happy hour is was lured us there.  For a buck a shuck, let's just say we went wild.  Even still we proceeded with dinner.  Since the oysters were filling to some degree, we both ordered pasta dishes.  Both were delicious and I now see that both are no longer on the menu.  I appreciate that this restaurant has a menu that changes on a regular basis.  To me that shows, that this is a restaurant that cares about it's food and is willing to take risks in the name of my tastebuds.  I'm sure I'll be back for another oyster happy hour, so I'm looking forward to trying something new.\\n\\nOur entrees were great.  So much so that we were willing to try dessert even though we both were pretty full at this point.  We had the S'mores Semifreddo by recommendation of our waiter.  I had no clue what a semifreddo was and wanted to order a safe classic like the ricotta donuts but our waiter was really selling the semifreddo.  I'm glad he did.  It was too good.  It's was rich, creamy chocolate kind of thing.  Just up my alley.  Rich enough to be satisfying and wanting to share it with someone else.\\n\\nWe had an awesome experience at Mayfield.  My cousin wanted to go back two weeks later, but my wallet wasn't ready.\", u\"Seasonal & local food always taste better to me. \\nAnd with casual, relaxing settings of Mayfield, this is a place you want to go to have a great dinner, drinks & conversations.\\n\\nIt's a decor that always warms my heart: brick, wood, warmth of lights & candles. Just simple idea that make you feel at home.\\n\\nWe sit by the window and watch street life go by while waiting for freshly shucked oysters, Happy Hour price - meaning we going to eat a lot of raw, salty, briny deliciousness on beautiful half shells...\\nWe ordered few other dishes to share - and while sandwich turned out a bit too rich for our tastes, Tuna Crudo was a dream that reminded me of lunches we had on coast of Mexico... Fresh, tangy, light and full of intermingling flavors, with watermelon, cucumbers, mint & marinade that just made it into summer in the bowl...\\n\\nAmazing drinks were poured to accompany our symphony of food - there are few places that create cocktails as masterpieces, and Mayfield is certainly one of them. \\nI am pretty much convinced it's liquid magic swirled in a glass around that ice cube.\\n\\n...Oh, the memories of summer... \\n\\nI need to come back to Mayfield soon. Very soon.\", u\"3.5. Came here for brunch with a friend before heading to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. We were seated at a table tucked next to the window, which was awesome for natural light filtering in. The vibe was kind of like the Smith if you've ever been, but more hipster... nice wood floors, tiling on the walls, and exposed brick. Food was solid.\\n\\nWe got the fried oysters, spoon bread, kale salad, and poached eggs pretty much all to share. The fried oysters came on a bed of greens and smoked salmon, which made it a really great appetizer value-wise. The oysters were also fried nicely and complemented well by the salad and smoked salmon. The spoon bread was an interesting... bread pudding / corn bread mix type thing, slightly sweet and slightly savory. It was really like a much moister corn bread, but quite good. Not the most flavorful thing. The shredded kale salad came with apples and a cream dressing, and was good. The poached eggs were on a some ham and a fried potato pancake, served with mixed greens and home fries. All in all, the food was pretty good and filling, but I don't think it anything particularly special. \\n\\nBecause we were in the corner it was hard to flag down servers, so I would have liked if they were a little bit more attentive to us.\", u\"Had brunch at Mayfield on Saturday afternoon while visiting Brooklyn. I ordered the House Corned Beef Tongue Hash.\\n\\nQuality\\nI was in New York City for the weekend so I was following the lead of my buddies for all food selections. On Saturday afternoon my friend suggested that we try out Mayfield for brunch. It was a bit later in the day so I figured I would be ordering lunch, but as soon as I saw the House Corned Beef Tongue Hash, I knew that would be my selection. A mix of tender meat, potatoes, and veggies with two poached eggs on top, a mustard hollandaise, and rye toast created a delicious mixture. I was not sure how I would feel about the mustard hollandaise, but it turned out to be pretty amazing. The highlight of the meal though was dragging the rye toast through the remains of the bowl and soaking up the delicious juices. I will say that my friend ordered the Patty Melt and I must admit that made me feel like I made the wrong selection.\\n\\nQuantity\\nThe House Corned Beef Tongue Hash comes in a good sized bowl with two pieces of toast on the side. I came in hungry though and I definitely felt like I could have used a side dish to go along with it.\\n\\nValue\\nAll the prices on the menu seemed pretty reasonable. My dish was about $15, which may be a little high for a breakfast dish, but the unique flavors make it worth that extra few dollars.\\n\\nAmbiance\\nMayfield is located in Brooklyn in an area known as Prospect Heights. Compared to the nearby businesses it has a much more hip and modern feel. Inside you can tell they left much of the original design in place. Red brick and white tiles line the walls and a beautiful wooden floor give it a cool feel. The inside area stretches longways with an open kitchen towards the back and a bar area in the center. It also seemed like that had a small outdoor patio open in the back. They were playing a great mix of indie rock music in the background, which really matched the vibe of the restaurant. Everything was great except the fact that it was unbelievably hot inside. At first we were seated towards the back and we assumed that the heat was coming from the kitchen. We ended up moving closer to the front, where we learned it was actually just obnoxiously hot throughout the entire restaurant. It honestly was hard to enjoy a meal and conversation because of the heat, and the room temperature water didn't help at all either.\\n\\nCrowd\\nThe restaurant was pretty busy for brunch on Saturday afternoon. It was full of couples and small groups of friends having food and drinks. It was a younger crowd and it had a very trendy style.\\n\\nService\\nOur waitress was great and was very charming in her descriptions of the food. Her midwest perspective was endearing and she helped our small group have a good time.\\n\\nParking\\nThere was street parking directly in front of the restaurant, but it was a bit of a challenge to get a spot. It took us two laps, but with persistence we were finally able to final sneak into one.\\n\\nExtra\\nMayfield was a good brunch spot that could have been better if not for how hot the restaurant was. I enjoyed the food, felt that it was reasonably priced, and thoroughly enjoyed the service. But there is nothing to ruin a meal like feeling uncomfortable in the environment and the sauna-like temperature made it that way.\", u'This a brunch spot in a borough and part of town where it\\'s competition exists on every corner. There\\'s no shortage of good food in Brooklyn and in this section of Brooklyn in particular. \\n\\nThat said the meal and drinks here still stand out! \\n\\nCorned beef Hash with a runny egg is a dish I have craved on hung over mornings for over a decade. Normally I would eat it, slumped half way over a diner table with a luke warm coffee, grumbling words to a dining partner in equal hungover pain. That said, it\\'s a tradition I love. \\n\\nBrooklyn food spots, and brunch spots in particular, have a unfettered 5-10 year tradition of taking classics staples of the middle class kitchen and dining table and \"upscaling\" it into a act of criminal hatred and disregard for fans of the original.  \\n\\nWhen I saw \"Corned Beef Tongue Hash w/ a Poached Egg and Hollandaise\" on the menu, suffice to say I approached with the caution that you approach a hungry bear. Yet still, I was hungry and painfully hungover, if ever there was a time my diner staple, it was now. \\n\\nI placed my order and nursed my bloody as I awaited what I was sure was disappointed and anger for hipster brunch culture. The bowl arrived and I was pleasantly surprised that at the very least it looked great. My instagram would surely induce a jealousy, even if the meal was not worth of it. \\n\\nI placed my fork in and broke my egg. The yoke ran; yellow and nearly gelatinous. A great start. I let the goal soak for a moment and then venture my first bite ...\\n\\nElation is a short version. It was a stunning bowl of food. Flavorful, delicious and perfectly balanced. I could have eaten it all day. Seriously, a standout bowl of food in a sea of anger inducing homogeneous \"brunch staples\". \\n\\nDon\\'t miss it!', u\"I stumbled upon this place for a last minute brunch spot in Brooklyn and found it to be charming. Immediately upon arriving at around noon, the place seemed packed and there was a wait, but lucky for my friend and I, there were two spots open at the bar. I think that was the best part of the entire experience, no wait time, and being seated right by the bar and having a great view of the kitchen and watching them make the food. \\n\\nI ordered the fried oysters, eggs benedict, and the peach puree mimosa. I think my issue with all the dishes was that I was not very impressed. They were good but I didn't find them spectacularly delicious. In all honesty, the food was just A-Okay. The issue was that the portions they provided were small in my opinion. The salad took up half my plate for the eggs benedict, which masked the amount of home fries they provided. The homes fries were red, which I assumed was because of a special in-house recipe, however, no details were provided on the menu. I liked the eggs benedict, however, the hollandaise sauce was not very impressive and was somewhat sour. The fried oysters were alright as well. I felt that I was eating mostly shredded cheese, which covered much of the dish as well. My peach puree drink was good, I actually liked that very much.\\n\\nI enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant. It was cozy and urban, staying authentic to the Brooklyn feel. Service was alright. While we did not have to wait for seating at all, it took a while to get out orders taken and food served. Then again, we sat at the bar so there is always that factor when getting service. \\n\\nOverall, I did enjoy my brunch but it was mediocre in my opinion. I perhaps would only come back for a brunch special or a happy house.\", u'Is this place as Superfly as its name suggests?\\n\\nIf that descriptor means solid food served up in a comfortable dining space with a happening atmosphere, then why yes, yes it is:\\n\\nI first tried this spot back when it opened and then forgot all about it.  Not sure why except maybe New American cuisine is pretty low on my list when it comes to attempting to figure out where to dine out.  I often find it muddled and boring, and guess maybe I\\'m more of a purist, but I digress.  Because I\\'d definitely return for a meal here.\\n\\nHubby and I grabbed some seats at the bar and shared a couple dishes:\\n\\nKale Salad:  They know how to treat this polarizing green with the TLC it needs to shine here.  Its tough center ribs were removed and the remaining leaves were cut super finely.  I have a feeling the shreds were then \"massaged\" to soften them up and make them more pleasant to chew.  I know all this crazy sh*t because this was very much like a Kale and Ricotta Salata Salad that I make at home, but with the addition of shredded apples.  Delicious, though perhaps on the small side for $11.00.\\n\\nFried Chicken Sandwich topped with Slaw plus Fries:  When we asked our friendly bartender to help us decide between sharing the Fried Chicken Sandwich or a Shrimp Po\\'Boy special, he enthusiastically recommended the former.  So we went with it.  And honestly, \\'solid\\' and \\'well-executed\\' are the two adjectives that leap to mind.  Totally something I\\'d be happy to eat again, but not more than that.\\n\\nSo yeah... I liked the energy at this spot and the food was good, if not especially life changing.  Am hoping to return to try the \"transcendent\" Burger Peter D. raves about.  Can you dig?', u\"Grilled ramps (5 stars): with pickled mushrooms, Parmesan flan. As cliche as being obsessed with ramps is, I'm still obsessed with them, and Mayfield does an amazing job with this hyper seasonal dish. Can't get much better than grilled ramps, but coupled with an umami packed sauce, the acidity of the mushrooms, and meltingly smooth flan...I'll be dreaming about this dish for the rest of the year.\\n\\nSpoonbread (4 stars): light and fluffy, just a tad sweet, crispy outside.\\n\\nSoft shell crab pasta special (3.5 stars): we also can't resist getting soft shell crab whenever it's on the menu. This rendition was solid, pan seared, crab was on the smallish side. Crispy onions and sugar snaps paired well for a springtime dish. Pasta was a bit too overcooked for our taste\\n\\nImpossible cake (3 stars): creamy flan over what tasted like a dense super sweet chocolate cake pudding. If you're into really sweet and rich desserts, this one is for you! It's just usually not the direction I tend to lean toward. \\n\\nService- 5 stars! Came at just the right times to take our orders, and food came out swiftly. They also have a cute outdoor seating area in the back, although it looks like there were only a couple tables there.\", u\"Went here for dinner with a gal pal to catch up a little while ago. She recommended this spot and another, I checked Yelp and ultimately chose to go here. Lo and behold, it was the right choice!\\n\\nThe decor in my opinion tips more towards an upper scale kind of casual. It was kind of loud in terms of ambiance so conversations were a little difficult to hear across the small table but the atmosphere would make for a nice intimate dinner date. Food was delicious! I had the fried buttermilk quail as my main entree. \\n\\nThe experience was lovely and I'm so glad to have gone here. I want to go back and try this place out for brunch but parking around here is horrendous. I was circling for maybe half an hour, although I admit it was during dinner time, so peak hours for this restaurant as well as the neighborhood definitely factored into that. Just something to keep in mind.\", u'We came here for brunch at 1:30pm on Saturday and were seated immediately. The vibe was all over: I saw large families with babies, young people with parents, 20-30 somethings like us.\\n\\nMenu was wonderful, although a bit pricey: +15 for most entrees. \\nI had the shrimp and grits, which was wonderful, aside from 3 aspects: 1) It was too much food. I hate feeling like I\\'m totally stuffed. 2)the grits we\\'re wayyyy too buttery, making an all-too-rich meal. 3) the shrimp had their tales on (idk what cuisine standards are, but I didn\\'t enjoy having to get my hands all gritty and greasy to take them off). Perhaps I was just too fussy?\\nMy friend had the beef tongue hash, and said it was \"one of the most satisfying brunch entrees\" he has ever had. I tried- really nice soft texture and the perfect amount of food. He also said the the mustard seed hollandaise was revolutionary.\\nMy other friend had the poached eggs with grit cakes, and also cleared the plate. Service was lovely. Would definitely go back for dinner/drinks.', u'Love this place. My whole goal was to find a oyster happy hour near my house and the goal has been achieved! The oysters are $1 each (6 minimum) I had 12 and I was super happy! The are fresh and delicious and I like the vinegar/onion dressing.  I am not sure the difference in types of oysters I will say these tasted more salty then others I have had, but not in a bad way.\\n\\nAfter the oysters I ordered the fried chicken sandwhich which was great, though my fries had a piece of hair in them so that killed the rest of my appetite. I was able to get a new batch but I just packed everything up at that point.\\n\\nThe bartender was great and kept me company/entertained while I was there which is always nice. It is definitely a place I will visit again.', u\"I'm back to update because I STILL LOVE MAYFIELD. They have this tuna burger on special sometimes that is RIDICULOUS. Oysters are still the best around. Service is great. Wine is good. Beer is good. ITS ALL SO GOOD.\", u\"What happens when you combine great atmosphere, food, and service? You know for certain that you've arrived at Mayfield. I picked this place on a whim, not that I don't trust other reviews, but I wanted good food in Crown Heights. They did not disappoint. The shrimp and grits with a side of collard greens and scrambled eggs were perfection on a plate. I was only a little creeped out at the shrimp looking up at me from the plate....yikes. But I cast him and his friends heads off and got about the business of eating. And it was worth it.\", u'Was pretty excited when we randomly walked in that they were doing a happy hour.\\n\\nEverything is amazing.\\n\\nThe burger, the food, the vibe.\\n\\nPlease bring this concept to my neighborhood!'], u'13.Sweet Chick': [u\"Wow is all I can say to describe a dining experience here. I have to admit this isn't the best place for fried chicken, but the combo of chicken and waffle with the magical butters makes it all worth it. Rosemary butter, strawberry butter, and honey butter accompanies your order and wow, it really does enhance the taste of everything. At one point I considered putting some of that butter in my bloody mary to enhance that experience too but the bartender was very generous with the bourbon.\\n\\nAlso tried the eggs benny and man, that biscuit base if delicious too. Would love for a sweet chick to open up in Southern California.\\n\\nWe came a little after they opened on a Sunday morning and it was already a 45 minute to an hour wait, but we saw opening at the bar and went straight in.\", u'I\\'m a pretty big fan of Sweet Chick\\'s Williamsburg restaurant, so I was naturally quite happy when I saw they were opening up a new location just up the street from me on Flatbush Ave. The Williamsburg spot has a \"rustic chic\" vibe to it, but the Prospect Heights location definitely looks & feels a lot cleaner and more modern, with a neon-lighted sign over the bar and sleek wooden benches. Nonetheless, the ambiance is still the same-- fashionable waitstaff, hip-hop blaring over the speakers, hand-drawn menus.\\n\\nI came here on my own for brunch on a Sunday at 2 pm, and waited over an hour to be seated as a party of one. The space is not much larger than the Williamsburg location, although the bar is first-come first-serve. Classic New York brunch experience... not for the faint-hearted if you don\\'t have a reservation.\\n\\nSweet Chick\\'s signature dish has to be their chicken & waffles, and to be totally honest it\\'s all I\\'ve ever ordered from their restaurant. Their chicken is covered in a delectable, perfectly seasoned crust, and tender and moist on the inside (even the chicken breast was quite juicy). The waffles are fluffy, not too dense, with a great buttermilk flavor. (Note: Sweet Chick does flavored waffles-- like apple cinnamon, rosemary & herb, etc.-- during dinnertime only. Only \"original\" waffles before 4 pm.) The waffles come with three types of flavored butters (berry, lemon, and rosemary & herb) which are all wonderfully fragrant and pair perfectly with maple syrup!\\n\\nThe only real thing that detracts from this place is how loudly they play their music. I understand that it\\'s part of the restaurant\\'s \"brand\", but I see so many families & groups of friends that stop in here for a meal and wonder how they can even hear each other over the music. Maybe I should just get hearing aids?', u\"I came for the fried chicken but the waffles stole the show. My bacon cheddar waffles were the perfect mix of sweet and savory in a light fluffy package. They came with a divine trio of flavored butters including lemon, berry and herb. The fried chicken was good but not the best I've ever had. You only get two pieces when you order the chicken and waffles. I highly recommend the crawfish hush puppies. They were a tasty and substantial appetizer accompanied by a heavenly remoulade that I couldn't get enough of.\\n\\nThe wait Friday night was 30-40 minutes for a table for 3 except that we got a table for 2 with an extra folding chair stuck practically in the entryway. Still the food was worth it and the ambeance was fun and lively.\", u'Been to the one in Williamsburg so excited to try the new one on Flatbush.  I arrived in time for the \"in between\" menu.  Glad that chicken was on it!\\nNice vibe, friendly servers.\\n\\nChicken and waffles ( rosemary and mushroom)- ok these waffles are so friggin good - might be best ever!  Holy smokes they are good with that butter!  That is definitely a 5.\\n\\nThe chicken was good (3). but those waffles....\\n\\nLemonade- hit the spot goodness!\\n\\nGiven this is brooklyn- the definition of hotness- sweet chicks needs to up its hot sauce game.  Franks with the label off just doesn\\'t cut it.  Get some locally sourced hot sauce that makes the chicken jump off the bone.', u\"Sweet Chick might be my new favorite brunch spot. My boyfriend and I went to the Park Slope location on a Sunday morning (about 11 AM) for brunch, and there was a 30 minute wait. I'm so glad we decided to wait! The inside of the place is cute and intimate, and looks like it used to be some sort of garage. I love the pink neon sign that hangs behind the bar, and the Motown music softly playing in the background. \\n\\nI wanted a tomato juice, but they only had tomato juice with bloody mary mix so I settled for that. It was really really spicy, but very tasty. My boyfriend got a cold brew which he really enjoyed. I ordered the shrimp and grits, my boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles, and we got a side of fruit to split. The fruit was an assortment of berries and bananas, which I really liked since fruit sides tend to be that bland assortment of melon with a chunk or two of pineapple. My boyfriend really liked his chicken and waffles, which came with a fun assortment of different butters. The shrimp and grits were HEAVENLY. Even though I was more stuffed than a Christmas goose by the time I was done eating, I was sad to see my plate empty!\\n\\nOther than the amazing food, the service was also great. Our server was super friendly and checked up on us often, making sure we always have plenty of water. I'm definitely looking forward to coming back here often!\\n\\nNOTE: if you're planning on paying with a credit card, make sure you bring your ID with you!\", u\"I first heard about this spot from a good friend of mine who said while passing on the bus she saw Sweet Chick which looked new and it was crowded we should go check it out. I actually decided took her up on her offer unfortunately she couldn't go with me due to other plans so i went with another friend.  \\n\\nWhen we go there you could tell it was something to try it was already crowded and there was a bunch of people waiting.  Our wait time was 45 minutes to an hour. We finally got a call to be seated but was asked if we wanted to seat by the bar which i was fine with. Sweet Chick we have amazed me i felt like i had a party in my mouth this  was the most delicious meal i have had in a long time. We had chicken and waffles and Sweet Chick waffle. \\nThe waffles tasted light and melted it your mouth , the chicken was crispy and nice and very flavorful.  The syrup was to die for i have never had such delicious syrup. Sweet Chick you made my day i will be back for more.\", u\"Love this place.\\n\\nI had been, years ago, to the one in Williamsburg, so I was super excited when this new location in Prospect Heights. It's much more accessible from where I live and much bigger than that location. \\n\\nAlways in the mood for chicken and waffles, which they specialize in, a friend and I ordered that. For the waffles, they bring out three samples of butter (honey lemon, strawberry, and herb) and some delicious maple syrup. It was finger licking good. The chicken was seasoned and cooked perfectly (VERY IMPORTANT), and the waffles were fluffy and warm and not too thick, as if Goldilocks had taste-tested. It was the perfect amount of just right\\n\\nFor drinks, I ordered the bloody mary (with tequila) and my friend ordered a mimosa. The bloody was pretty good, not the best I've had but drinkable. I didn't get a second. Instead, I decided to try out the mimosa. It wasn't that good either. The sparkling wine was very dry, the orange juice wasn't that great and it was warm, from what I remember. Again, not the worst but not something I want to order again.\\n\\nNevertheless, the bad drinks didn't stop the show and it won't keep me from going back.\\n\\nTIP: For brunch, expect some kind of wait time--up to an hour? Don't come starving. Give them your name, walk around, and they'll text you when the table is ready. Also, get the chicken and waffles. Two orders actually. Bring one to me. Thanks!\", u'(3.5) So I\\'ve never actually been to any of the Sweet Chicks, despite the first location being just about at my doorstep. Came here on opening night because we were hungry, and, DUH, chicken and waffles!\\n\\nI had the classic 2 pieces of chicken plus a waffle of my choosing option. I chose the spiced pecan waffle. Dining mate chose the Louisiana Hot Waffle from the speciality options, which comes with spicy chicken pieces and a plain waffle drizzled in milk jam (i.e. sweetened condensed milk)\\n\\nThe chicken pieces were SMALL! Noticeably smaller to my dining mate who has been to both the other locations. We joked about what happened to the chicken shipment on the way to the spot...\\n\\nSize-value perception aside, taste was ON POINT. Crispy, juicy, flavorful chicken pieces. But, the waffle was the standout to me. The fluffiest and like least guilt inducing carb load waffle I\\'ve had in awhile (maybe ever?!) I\\'d come back just for the waffles for sure. And of course, the butters. BUTTAHHHHH! Wild Berry, Lemon, and Herb.\\n\\nWe also had a side of brussels sprouts with almond slivers. Delicious, BUT caramelized and heavily roasted, so don\\'t look to this for your daily portion of green veggies or to make you feel better about your entree choices in the least.\\n\\nLastly, skip the spiked lemonade, nothing special to me.\\n\\nBut otherwise, it\\'s great to have a location of theirs \"deeper\" into Brooklyn. I\\'m not mad at it, but I was less than blown away too for a first time diner.', u\"Came here with my girlfriend when I got rejected by the Woodland resturant due to their lame dress code on Saturday nights (Can't go in with shorts)\\n It turned out to be a great decision! Those  cheddar bacon waffles are amazing and their drinks are pretty good! Definitely would recommend this place to anyone who loves chicken and waffles. Oh and the music was on point! Nothing better than eating chicken and waffles to some trap music\", u\"This spot is amazing!! ... my first time coming into Sweet Chick today .. did not know what to expect was welcomed by a nice lady didn't catch her name .. she got us seats and we sat down ( I actually came here with a friend ) . Got the menu , and bam ! All I wanted was chicken and waffles .. I must say was spot on . Waffles was soft and delicious , the syrup hit the spot with the waffles .. also they add three flavors of butter on the table in case you want .. I didn't care for the butter but thanks .. \\n\\nThe chicken came off the bone nicely , and it was delicious as well juicy if I might add . We also order on the side mac and cheese ... I loved loved loved it .. it was not to cheesy and it was well prepared. My friend got the chicken sandwich and fries .. the fries were actually good . \\n\\nThe drinks .. I had two Bellini and the Queen of New York I could say my friends .. this is now my new home .  \\n\\nLove the cozy ambiance and the staff that works there good job . Def won me over .\", u\"So the food was amazing no doubts about that ! They would of had five stars if the glass bottles they use for water weren't dirty :( I poured the rest of the water into my glass and it was black specs in my water and it made me lose my appetite luckily I was done eating by that time but it really turned me off! If you are loooking for amazing food you should try them just check your water before you drink it\", u\"I saw the grand opening for this restaurant and love chicken and waffles, so I came here as soon as I found out they were open. I came here for dinner around 8:30, which actually had a 45-minute wait for a table of 2. However, they had available spots at the bar, which you could order the full food menu from, so we picked that option as we were quite hungry around that time. The ambience was very chill and reminded me a little bit of 90s LA with the neon lighted signs. They were able to open the windows/walls to the outside which was also nice. Service was great, and the chicken and waffles (OH MAN). I ordered the chicken and waffles with cinnamon apple waffles. SO. GOOD. The waffles were the perfect amount of fluffiness with a hint of sweetness from the cinnamon sugar. And the chicken itself was great and crispy. It had a great amount of flavor, and each chicken and waffle dish came with a thigh and a breast piece. I will saw though that my chicken breast was slightly dry, but went great drenched with maple syrup and my waffle. My friend ordered the Nashville chicken and waffles which was just a little spicy with milk and jam flavored waffles. I think they smothered his chicken with butter, so his chicken breast wasn't dry. I couldn't taste the jam flavor in his waffles but I definitely tasted the buttermilk. Again, his waffle was as amazingly fluffy as mine. The only complaint that I have about the dishes were that I wished that there was more chicken in each dish for $17. \\n\\nThe day we came here for dinner was actually my friend's birthday, and when I asked the waiter if they did anything for birthdays, the owner actually came out later and surprised us with one of their desserts, a blueberry cobbler with mascarpone ice cream. Which was incredibly nice of them because after a lot of going back and forth with the dessert menu, we actually decided against getting dessert, but they surprised us with it anyway! Great service and food; I will definitely be back.\", u\"I was a sucker and ordered a $11  Kale BLT. While it wasn't mind blowing clearly  folks don't flock here to eat rabbit food. It's probably know for the chicken,the variety of waffles and butters.I was all waffled out by this point and my body was screaming at me to $ get to my healthy eating. Nothing like a pile of Kale topped with thick cut bacon to help me get back on track. The bacon is always the star when paired with boring Kale. Would love to have the greens brought alive with lemon, avacado,and some spices then maybe a winner.\\n\\nClearly the kale cost more in Brooklyn. Kale is Kale. My next trip here I will leave covered in syrup and butter. Loved the neighborhood and atmosphere. Easy to find steps away from the train.\", u\"I've eaten at the other Sweet Chick locations around the city and always walked away full and happy. So I was excited to hear that they were moving in down the street here in Prospect Heights.\\n\\nWe've visited a couple times since opening, for both brunch and dinner. The vibe is friendly and bustling. As always, get the chicken and waffles along with some mac n cheese (and those cocktails . . . ).\\n\\nThe best compliment I can give the new spot is that it is just as good as the others. I can't wait for them to add some outdoor seating and open those big garage doors. \\n\\nWelcome to the neighborhood!\", u\"3.5 *.   Is it tasty - yes. Then again... it's fried chicken. Fried Chicken is always tasty\\nI think the food is quite good actually - the chicken was moist and flavorful, waffle nice and fluffy, mac and cheese has nice complexity of flavor.\\nSo why just 3-stars? It's too damn expensive for what it is. $17 for 2 small pieces of fried chicken and waffle. $9 mac and cheese. $6 lemonade (which was good and fresh, but common)\\n\\nI may be back. The atmosphere is very nice, especially on a summer day when windows are open. Seating is nice and open. Service is pretty good. So it can be a nice way to enjoy a meal.\\n\\nBut I just have trouble getting over paying $40 buck fried chicken, mac and cheese and lemonade.\\n\\nSo in fairness - 4 stars for food, -1 for price. Somewhere in 3.5 star range is fair\\n(perhaps I'll go back to try other dishes. No problem upgrading the rating if other dishes can offer more value or more flavor profile)\\n\\nPS. What's the deal with checking id when paying by card? Never had that happen in Park Slope...\", u\"I was excited to see this new Sweet Chick location in Brooklyn. I love the Williamsburg location but I was excited to see this one open because it is much closer to home. It was a Monday afternoon, so we came for the weekday brunch. For a Monday there was a good amount of people there but we were seated right away. They do have high chairs for the little ones. I ordered the original waffles and chicken which was very good. The waffle was light and crispy and the chicken was seasoned well. My sister got the apple cinnamon waffles and chicken. Those waffles were really good. Think I'll try one of the flavored waffles next time. The staff was nice and attentive. Cant wait to come back to this location again. The restaurant is small like the other locations. I probably wouldn't come here with a group bigger than 4 people.\", u\"Came in on a Thursday afternoon, obviously not busy since it was 11:30am only. Was seated immediately but after 5 minutes realized they forgot to give us menus. So i stood up and grabbed the menu. Other than the menu situation service was great. \\n    I came here for weekday brunch with my best friend and obviously we were comparing with other great eats. I thought the chicken was seasoned really well but chicken meat itself was super dry I watched in pain as my girlfriend tried to salvage the chicken by dousing it in syrup for her chicken and waffles. My shrimp and grits wasn't bad but needed more seasoning the sauce was a bit bland like a light tomato pepper soup. Shrimp was cooked perfectly (Thank you!) \\nThis place made me really really miss SoCo.\", u\"Being first-time, working parents in NYC often means there isn't a lot of time to go out and just chill, however we managed to do so this afternoon thanks to this spot... Awesome place, awesome food, awesome staff!!!... the host was extremely accommodating and sat us at a table where we could park our stroller without us having to ask, our server was knowledgeable and polite, as mentioned before the food was exactly as expected, and delicious! Thank you!\", u\"I ordered the fried buffalo chicken and spiced pecan waffle. It was delicious. But really spicy. The general taos chicken was spicy. So I'm guessing anything that's suppose to b spicy is really spicy. The atmosphere is nice. Mixed crowd. Good music vibe. A little loud where h feel like u may have to yell for others at your table to here you. The water taste like tap in a fancy bottle tho. The prices are vry reasonable. I would go again.\", u'To be honest these are the reviews I dread most. The reviews where you\\'ve visited a new location for an up and coming chain hoping for that same spark yet leave disappointed. Truth be told it was an \"interesting\" date night. That being said no one likes a waitress who seems bored or annoyed. Throw in a dash of uncooked rice, bland sides ( Mac&Cheese , Collard Greens) , a sad tiny drink made for a toddler and the ambience of a bad rap battle whose contestants were lost in the twilight zone then hey that\\'s a recipe for disaster. Seriously you guys at this location have to do better. \\n\\n   I have to say I really enjoyed my Williamsburg location visit much better. It was the reason we wanted to visit Sweet Chick at it newest location which is close to home. Moving on, guys what is up with those small chicken pieces? Is this borderline fine dining ? If so plate everything as beautifully as the octopus dish. Hopefully this isn\\'t the norm . Perhaps it was a bad night? I would like to give this place the benefit of the doubt but this evening has me fixing these bland sides and hoping my chicken grows while being reheated . Right now Sweet Chick has left a sour taste in my mouth.'], u'19.Taiki': [u'Stumbled upon this lovely Sushi Chef, Taiki owned petit restaurant after an local event. Way later dinner time of 9:15pm than I wanted but tstk tstk aside it was my birthday! Besides two other tables, we were cordiality yet warmly entertained by both our lady server and Taiki himself! Visually minimalistic but full on texture, flavor, and perfect temperature. \\n\\nWe had the knockout 10-spice and lime crusted Edamame, Toro Tartare, Deep Fried Monkfish and chef special Sashimi Omakase + NegiToro and UniScallop rolls. Ok the Hokkaido Scallop wrapped in Nori was pure buttery bliss and Aji and ChuToro just were cut with a bit of bulk and tapering off to a fine stream of freshness. Chef continued with SalmonTobiko Toll and ended this culinary bed wetting goodness of,  of course, fluffiest almost pastry-like Tamago with a birthday candle (yes I turned one as in F21)\\n\\nThe Chef Owner was all convo and laid back since we were the last customers closing the place and disclosed his previous position at Bond Sushi which in my opinion had gone downhill from mass discount exposure. You can tell he\\'s a chill and laid back and wanting to make not so much \"Sushi of Jiro Dreams\" journey but great food skills and appreciation a la Brooklyn vibes. \\n\\nThe music from Senegalese to Portuguese pop lent an audibly interesting landscape which we throughly enjoyed. \\n\\nWe will be back, Taiki!! K-dog in tow....', u\"So we're cheaters. I admit I felt bad about it but got over it since it was sanctioned by my wife. Actually, it was her idea & reservation. We went to try a new sushi place a bit of the path. \\n\\nWas it worth it? You bet. \\n\\nVariety is the spice of life they say and we're such sushi lovers that not having a deeper bench didn't benefit us in the least. So enter Taiki. \\n\\nWe dove right in and ordered the Gazpacho & yellowtail sashimi salad. Both great starts and the Gazpacho gets an extra bump because it's so not what you'd expect, but in a really good way. The sashimi salad melts in your mouth. I mean, it's ridiculous. For our mains we had to have the blue fin toro tasting. Then we opted for sushi of Japanese yellowtail, golden amberjack, salmon & toro scallion roll. It took a bit of time to come out but our server was so on top of things it didn't matter. Water filled consistently and appropriate check-ins. \\n\\nWhen it did come -all we could say was wow. That and where'd it go. Yes, we are it all, possibly too quickly. After digesting we realized we had to do a second round. It may have been gluttonous but it was worth it. \\n\\nIt's only been around a little while and not in the usual mix of Carroll Gardens/Cobble Hill/Gowanus restaurants. But if you're after fresh fish that melts in your mouth check them out. It is glorious.\", u'I wanted to love this place and was really looking forward to going. The main reason for the two stars on this - was that the service truly didn\\'t match the price. This is quite sad, because the food truly was delicious.\\n\\nAtmosphere: A quiet walk through Boerum hill will lead you to this super cute, clean, whitewashed brick interior with fairy lights and greenery. The Chef greets you with a big hello and a smile. Our party of 3 was sat in the back - I think every table in this place is a nice one.\\n\\nService: We were greeted within a few minutes with some water and instructed to take a look at the drink menu. We ordered Sake and wine. When I asked about the profile of the Sake - I was told it was great. We ordered the corn and mushroom risotto for an appetizer -and then the server recommended the Edamame. Since we were hungry - it was a good idea. The edamame was delicious - the risotto, ok. We ordered our entrees at the same time,(2) 10 piece Sashimi Omakase and (1) 10 piece Sushi Omakase. I mentioned that I hated Makerel - and he said \"Well we are so busy tonight, we are running out of all of the fish - we will see what we can do\". Pretty crazy that you pay $50 for a tasting menu of the best - when you might just be being served the leftovers. The waiter pretty much disappeared after that - no water or drinks for a while. 90 minutes after our order - dying of starvation - the server let us know that it would be ready in 10 minutes. Clearly, we were forgotten about. \\n\\nThe food came, the server drilled over the types of fish - but not super sure about which was which. The Sushi came out as a 5 piece - and I asked if another plate would come - and he was like no this is it - oh wait - no it will come out later. Just strange.\\n\\nThe fish was buttery, delicious and well cut. We paid. $300 for 3 people - I have had better service at Gramercy Tavern -- or Applebees.', u\"Can't believe I forgot to write a review.....we ate here after my Japanese neighbour raved about it and she was right !  Love the ambience - the white painted brick - the clean feeling - nice lighting with plants. Very modern and unpretentious. And the food was not typical sushi bar food. The chef/owner clearly has his own vision and creativity and also excellent quality.\\nWe had the delicious edamame and the uni scallop roll was so good we ordered another.\\nI had a beautiful cold sake and my husband had beer. Will definitely return.\\nIt was very pleasant to sit at the counter and watch the chef\", u\"Delicious, melt-in-your-mouth sushi. Highlights included the seared belly sushi trio (see picture - we ordered two), and the uni scallop roll. I also lived their innovative use of shishito in a sushi roll! Service was fine and the restaurant itself is beautiful and peaceful. Only downside was how pricey the food was and portions were small. I could've kept eating and eating but my wallet just couldn't handle it!\", u\"I am just handing out these five stars right now. Come get them while I'm feeling nice.\\n\\nMy dad took me to Taiki as a special treat. As a broke millennial, sushi is not something I can easily come by. So I was prepared for this meal. My dad happens to know Taiki, the head chef, so he just asked Taiki to give us whatever he thinks is best. I love doing this because I certainly trust the chef more than myself.\\n\\nI was sitting at the bar so I could see the whole process. It's an ART. It was incredible to watch him calmly make one order after another. I cannot actually name everything I had but all of it was really beyond anything I've ever had. The fish is not too fishy but still carries so much flavor. The texture was always on point. I had an eggplant appetizer dish and the flavor was the perfect mix of sweet and salty. They have a dessert that was insane. I can't remember it right now (will update later).\\n\\nI was very shocked that someone came in and started asking about vegetarian options. I love my veg friends but I gotta keep it real right now. Don't go here if you can't eat fish. It's just kind of .... pointless! The true experience of this place is appreciating the fresh fish. This is not tofu teriyaki bento box type of place (love me some of those as well, not throwing shade) so there are way fewer options. But if you want to be in the presence of Taiki, I understand you ;)\", u\"Chef Taiki has such a charming character you will fall in love at once and not only his character, his sushi is his character itself..! The interior is unique yet not overly designed. Very simple and cozy. Not like one of those snobby restaurants you would not want to go back again atmosphere wise and price wise. I'm always excited to go to eat at Taiki. Best place to be in the neighborhood!!\", u\"One of the best Japanese restaurants I've been to in the city! Amazing service and food. Jonno was a terrific server. His appreciation of Taiki's  food and hospitality was superb. Definitely coming back again.\", u'We sat at the bar and had the summer miso and ten piece sushi. It was all delicious and beautifully presented.', u\"Surprised that a new restaurant can immediately find a spot amongst the best Omakase in New York, but here we are. One of the more intimate sushi bars in the city, the main attraction is the bar itself, where chef Taiki works his magic and masterfully dispenses tasty morsels from the sea.\\n\\nWe had the extremely reasonable $60 Omakase on our visit, and every piece was stellar - no misfires. The tuna and uni, in particular, were very strong and induced us to add a negitoro and uni/scallop roll to our evening, and neither disappointed. \\n\\nThe monkfish karaage appetizer was completely standout and a welcome take on the chicken dish. We'll be ordering that again. We went before the liquor license came through, but we're eager to go back and try what they offer there too.\", u\"Don't understand what the hype is about. We love finding new spots and usually yelp is on point. But at Taiki we were truly disappointed. The menu is extremely limited and rather pricey. I don't mind an expensive meal if the restaurant is special. Not only did everything take forever but the toro roll had to be sent back. The miso chowder was interesting and the salad was fresh. Sushi pieces and uni roll were average. They should also hire more knowledgeable servers.\", u'Loved our recent meal at Taiki. A great space, wonderful staff and truly delicious food and drinks. The monkfish, crispy rice, omakase and sake sangria were excellent. A not inexpensive but very welcome addition to the neighborhood.', u\"I came here on a moderately busy night. It's a cozy spot, very sophisticated and inviting--great lighting. \\n\\nWe wer promptly seated by our bubbly server, Abilene. She was clear and attentive but not overbearing. \\n\\nThe Food was clean, well presented, and tasty! \\n\\nLooking for fly japanese with good service? Check out Taiki Fa'sho~\", u\"Delicious. Excellent sushi chef. The edamame is addicting (which is hard to do). The atmosphere is soothing; service isn't ideal but it is good. I also lived in Manhattan for 11 years before moving to BK so I am used to everything happening quickly. It's relaxing and each dish is very good. I highly recommend.\", u'Probably the best edamame I have EVER had and the sushi was top notch. We got the omakase and we\\'re both floored by the quality of the fish and the rice. \"Belly three ways\" was AMAZING and the staff was so so nice. Thrilled that a really good sushi place is in our neighborhood! We will be back for sure.', u'Great for my fiance and I\\'s first \"omakase\" as it isn\\'t that pricey. But I believe the omakase here is always the same sushi selection so when we were up for the next omakase, we looked elsewhere for a more varied experience.', u'Low key home town sushi place. Chef was cool and funny, love watching him make sushi, fast and precise movements. Affordable prices like in most sushi places I go to. Make sure to order sake, goes well with salmon sushi', u\"South Brooklyn has developed a well deserved reputation  as a destination for high-quality restaurants of diverse cuisines. Taiki, which arrived in its Gowanus location two weeks ago, adds another sushi establishment to the select group of restaurants that define some the character of these communities.\\nThe gold leaf restaurant name sobreposed on chalk serving the times, set the tradition-conscious but also adventurous tone of the sushi bar, right at its front door. Once inside, diners can choose to sit at one of the nicely spaced tables - no need for fighting for elbow space - or at the sushi bar, where they will witness Chef Taiki himself in action.\\nThe sushi Omakase menu offered attractive prices ($50 for a 10-piece), for which Chef Taiki delivered a great selection. The sushis were traditional and in line with what you expect at high-end sushi places. Impeccable fish cut the right way, seasoned and served over a bed of warm rice.\\nThe menu also offers an inventive selection of appetizers, twisting Japanese staples to include novel techniques or ingredients to bring out better flavors. Mussel shishito peppers, and the miso chowder (its thicker and heartier than traditional miso) were great surprises, full of flavor and fun.\\nWe visited the restaurant the day after they received their liquor license, and the only two alcoholic beverages options were Aishi beer and one variety of sake, which turned out to be very good.\\nThis is a very good restaurant that brings a new class o sushi dining to a neighborhood that hadn't seen it. The prices are inviting, and anyone should save to visit this place. It's an absolute delight for mind and soul.\", u\"Omakase to me is when you sit in front of the sushi chef and they serve you piece after piece and dinner ends up being about an hour and half at a minimum because you're taking your time enjoying every piece, having some sake, and chatting with the chef or chatting amongst yourselves.  This was NOT the case at TAIKI.  Their version of OMAKASE is really just chefs special sushi.  It was not served piece after piece.  For $60, it was a glorified assembly line sushi deluxe order.  Definitely not the true omakase experience that you get at places like CAGEN or ONODERA.  OK, maybe it's not fair to compare this place with the likes of CAGEN or ONODERA.  Fine.  I will compare it with the omakase at UOGASHI which is more in the price point of this place, but still I think that was 10 times a better omakase experience than this.   Fish quality was average here.  The toro had some tendons in there that were not handled properly.  There was a bit too much rice in the sushi.  Rice quality was a bit hard.  The ikura which was not part of the omakase turned out to be quite good and the only memorable piece for me.  It was marinated well with a hint of yuzu.  We had the tamago brulee with yuzu sorbet for dessert and it was good but I feel that there was a bit too much brown sugar torched.  The egg turned out a bit too wet for my liking.  The Chef was not very engaging or attentive.  We tried to get his attention to order extra sushi and had to really make an effort to do so,  The waitress was somewhat passive aggressive.  She popped up and interrupted our conversation several times.  ONE-DONE!\", u'First thing to note is the decor. The menu is short and sweet. Sushi is very good. The neighborhood needed a place like this.'], u'77.ChowTime': [u'This is by far my favorite restaurant in Coney Island when it comes to Chinese and Vietnamese food. I have ordered delivery from this restaurant and have went in person. Delivery is quick and service is amazing. The Vietnamese sandwiches are by far the best items on the menu. My favorite is the chicken Vietnamese sandwich. I highly recommend it! The beef pho was delicious. Their Chinese food tastes way better than your local Chinese restaurant. I guarantee it! Also make sure you get the bubble tea! 100% worth it!!!', u'I am not so sure why the reviews are so high for this place because I experienced the antithesis. Perhaps maybe it is because I ordered delivery...I am not really sure, but gross. The Chinese food was oily and, and the Pho was just not good. I can appreciate that they delivered it all separately with the bean sprouts on the side and the broth on the side, but the noodles were rubbery and hard to bite through. The roasted pork was fatty and rubbery. I figured I would try two different things and share with my colleague: Pho and Shrimp and Lobster sauce with pork fried rice. We took a bite of each and chucked it in the garbage. Never again.', u'You should try the pho. And their dumplings are good too. Quick delivery. Huge quantities. Definitely worth every penny.', u'I went there for a nice healthy lunch of vegetable pho today and it was REMARKABLE . I grabbed a menu to order from them going forward. The staff were very nice and everything is very clean. Definitely one of my fav pho spots. Also the prices are extremely reasonable for the servings!', u\"I was very happy with my delivery from ChowTime .  The Shrimp Rolls are crazy good.  The beef pho was packed perfectly. , The cliantro lime, and bean sprouts we're all fresh, not that brown dissapointment you may normally receive. The pho broth was rich and piping hot. There was brisket and fresh eye round with the onions, scallions and rice noodles.   Could they have sent some Sriracha, yeah....But I have it.  Hoizon?   Got that too...Just  sharing all the details so you have the right expectations.  Mostly because I think this is a good quality food spot and I'm glad they deliver to Bensonhurst from Coney island. Good food good delivery. 5 stars in these categories\", u'Chinese restaurants nowadays are nothing like authentic Chinese food. They favor to how an American would like it hence why I never order Chinese food until ChowTime opened. I\\'ve been dying to try it for over a month and when I did, I was beyond impressed. The food is fresh and despite the wait it was so worth it. I haven\\'t tried food from a small Chinese restaurant like that in a long time. Every \"Chinese restaurant\" should look up to ChowTime. I ordered a spicy shrimp fried rice and my boyfriend ordered a general tso chicken. Give this place a try next time you\\'re at Coney Island!!', u'I was hungry for Vietnamese food recently and found this gem with 15 minute walk from my hotel. I went there and was presently surprised as it has the appearance of typical Americanized Chinese restaurants but the taste was far from it.  I ordered Pho Beef and chicken dumplings. I gave 4 stars as the dumplings were deep fried and not what I am uses to from living in China but still very tasty. The Pho Beef reminded me of other beef noodle dishes ive had in Asia plus they give lots of bean sprouts and Chinese parsley to add to your liking.  Great place to eat especially for take out.', u\"We've ordered from here a few times now. We have tried both Chinese and Vietnamese food including sandwiches and all were great. Fresh food, good prices. Very accommodating to my no carb diet.\", u\"Chow Time has a very interesting menu from vietnamese cuisine to chinese cuisine. When they first opened up for online delivery, I was pretty psyched about it as they do have a pretty big menu - so you don't get bored of your day to day lunch options. I had really liked the Pho here, however there were a few times where my order came and the noodles were not Pho, but instead were some kind of hard noodles (wasn't a fan of that). If the can stay consistent with the recipes and ingredients, I would be ordering from here more frequently. Service has been very friendly and the food arrives promptly.\", u'Super cool spot for Chinese & Vietnamese food! I highly recommend the fried chicken dumplings with buffalo sauce, it was amazing taste\\uff01Get quickly and the people were very nice there too.', u\"What a disappointment. Place is tiny, not properly organized. The entire space smells oily and if you walk in and out, you will smell like oil for some time. The food? Pho is not original and taste oily. Feel bad for the cooks who don't even have enough space to cook or even sit.\", u\"Had it again, ordered Pho for delivery (I've never done this before for Pho).  Probably one of the best Pho I've had in a while in NY.\", u'Speedy and friendly service. Highly recommend to visit this spot! Try the broccoli dishes.', u\"Food is great, delivery super fast. And the prices are unbeatable. It's better than take-out other places for sure\", u'Omg ! Great food at a great price ! Everyone is polite . I would definitely come back again with friends ! ! Highly recommend to visit this spot !!!', u\"I came here yesterday for my Chinese food cravings!! It's definitely worth a try if you're around Coney Island. I came for pickup and the service was fast. I tried the Triple Delight and it was so good. It came with Pork Chops (my favorite part of the dish), fried egg, sausages and some cucumbers/carrots/ tomatoes. So so worth it for it's price.\", u\"It's a new spot in the neighborhood so I went in to see what they offered. It seems to be a family owned business. They were all extra sweet. Karen is so adorable and helped me to decide on getting the lychee tea. It was great. They had some options on the menu that I would love to explore so I took a menu to go. I'm definitely going back to get the fried rice and try out the coconut bubble tea.\", u\"Awesome awesome awesome.  Good old fashioned Chinese food.  You know the one with brown fried rice with egg.  Not that yellow stuff the other Chinese restaurants pass off that is horrible.  I had the pork fried rice and didn't use any duck sauce or soy sauce.  That's how good it was.  I had the Singapore Mei Fun and it was delicious.  The only complaint was that the egg roll was drowned in grease.  So much that it spilled out of it.  Hence the 4 stars.  That's an easy fix so definitely give them a try.  I have never tried  Vietnamese food so I can't speak about that but it is on my agenda to try.  Enjoy!  It's worth it and prices are fair.\", u'Family owned small shop by the trainstation, everyone is extremely friendly, the food is great, so far I ordered beef mei fun(rice noodles) beef with broccoli and shrimp with broccoli, the viet sandwich was alright but everything else was great.', u\"The prices here are amazing for the service and product. Hot bubble tea wasn't advertised on the menu, but they made it for me. I am always disappointed by hot and sour soup, but continue to order it at places, in hopes someone will change my mind. CHOW TIME changed my mind. This hot and sour soup is the best I have ever had. The egg roll is simply divine as well. Crispy, flakey outside and tasty insides... perfect ratio and factors. If I lived close by, this place would be my regular spot with out a doubt.\"], u'171.Coney Shack': [u'The location is loud and open area with picnic tables which is so-so, but it is WORTH IT for these tacos.\\nAlso the tacos are pricey! $5 each or 3 for $14. But it is WORTH IT\\nI wish I took a photo of these beautiful tacos. I had one crunchy fish and two pork. The pork was soooooo delicious and the fish taco was beautiful and good and huge. I love it. I hope they have this in the city somewhere?!?!??!?', u\"The BEST fusion of its kind.\\n\\nMy partner and I stumbled upon this place and have been scouting it's location closer to manhattan! \\n\\nThey are usually located in Coney Island, but there have rumors that they are no longer there. Not to Fear! Recently, they have been popping up in the urban spaces located in the garment district near Time Square. \\n\\nEvery time we go, we always order the Crunchy Fish Taco. The piece was fish is fried to perfection and is accompanied by a delicious sauce, slaw and green onions. At this point we've tried them all and this is the reason we always return.\\n\\nAs for the other tacos, the Calamari is great as it is made to order along with the lemon grass grass chicken and grilled pork. They also have asian inspired hot dogs and entrees that we are also interested to try.\\n\\nGrade: A\", u\"Amazing tacos.  Full flavored perfectly cooked.  Calamari is cooked to order.  So tender and delicious. \\n\\nIf you've been to Nathan's to say you got a Nathan's then move on to Coney Shack.  So good\", u\"These guys serve up some really amazing tacos and hot dogs. I stop by there place as often as I can for their Crunchy Fish tacos - just can't get enough of them. I have tried the other tacos as well, and while they are all very very good I always come back tot he crunchy fish.\\n\\nThe service is super friendly as well. They love to make small talk and joke around about their collection of hot sauces available for you to try on your tacos. Now if hey say one of those sauces are spicy take them at their word and be careful or you might end up not being able to taste anything for an hour and sweating profusely. I warned you, and they probably did too.\\n\\nIf you can't find the time to visit their location in Coney Island you will be happy to learn they participate in the LIC Flea and Food (in Queens), Broadway Bites (38th & Broadway), and the Bryant Park Winter Market. These markets open up at various times throughout the year so make sure you look up the times in advance.\", u'One of the best tacos you can have in nyc. I got the garlic chicken taco and it was unbelievable. Tortilla was fresh, the pickled daicon was a nice touch.\\n\\nI also tried the pork burrito. It was delicious. The tortilla was perfect and held everything to together very well. They toasted the tortilla too. The pork was delicious and flavors worked well. The only criticism is maybe there was a little too much rice in it but it is still good!\\n\\nCome here if you are in coney island!', u'Not sure if they closed down or what it is, tried going for lunch for the past month and there was a sign up every time saying under maintenance. Any one have any updates?', u'Damn Daniel! As they say in ancient Greek. \\n\\nHOLY PHUC, is what it\\'s called, and that\\'s what you will be screamin\\' after the first bite. \\n\\n#foodgasm, #mouth-watering, #addictive, #foodporn, #perfection-personified, #life-changing, #best I have ever had, #to die for, #out of this world. Those are just a few of the hashtags floating around social media when describing Coney Shack\\'s fish / hotdog concoction. \\n\\nYou want to know why? Just listen to the ingredients, and you will understand:\\n     It starts out with a beef frankfurter, and a beer battered crunchy fish - basa from the catfish family - in a hot dog bun (yes, you heard right, fish in a hot dog!). Then it gets Sprinkled with some pickled red onions, and drizzled with three types of sauces: tomato basil creole sauce, scallion oil, & lemongrass aioli. To put \"the cherry on the cake\" they top it with a four cheese blend. By then, the Brulee torch will come out, and finish the job by melting the cheese, adding the burnt texture that makes their hotdog creation so irresistible. \\n\\nIn simple words, despite the HOLY PHUC having a wide range of bold, and contrasting flavors, the flavors, somehow, balanced each other out perfectly. The individual flavor notes still came through, adding an extra dimension of heartiness and satisfaction to the dish. \\n\\n_________\\n\\nI know what some of you might think. Here we go again with yet another gimmicky combo! (Burgers in Rice buns, etc.) I mean c\\'mon, how on planet earth is this not a recipe for disaster?!? With all the contrasting and conflicting flavors in it... Truth be told, I was skeptical as well. Till I took the first bite. \\n\\nThe flavor of the burnt crispy cheese on top, \\nthe fatty flaky fish taste, \\nthe freshness of the soft bun, \\nthe rich umami flavor of the frank. \\n      Include in all this, the exotic flavors, that the three sauces bring to the table, and it\\'s a full on Orchestra. Though playing to different flavor notes, come together in harmonic rhythm to orchestrate a truly unique and expansive flavor profile. \\n\\nWhat\\'s ironic, is that this unique gastronomic masterpiece is sold, out of a food truck, in an unassuming spot, not far from the Coney island boardwalk. So go grab some before the lines become bigger, and prices higher.\\n\\n~ Cash only\\n~ Food truck\\n~ Holy phuc, & fish tacos are a must try\\n~ It\\'s adjacent to the DMV building\\n~ Really hard to find parking in that area\\n\\n#I\\'mout\\n#Bon-app\\xe9tit\\n#I\\'llbeback', u\"I got to try the fish taco at the NYC Taco Showdown event, and it was quite delicious! The outside is very crispy and the fish is fresh and tasty. Lots of vegetables complement the fish, and the sauce is light and not too overwhelming. A good balance of vegetables and meat for sure. I don't think I would be willing to pay for a taco at the actual food truck though; it doesn't seem worth it to me.\", u\"So they finally started coming down to the FiDi and it was definitely worth the wait!\\n\\nOK, so I didn't get to try their most popular items, like the burritos or bowls, because they were out of rice, but I did help myself to a Chicka Dog for $6. \\n\\nFirst, you might ask, how do they run out of rice? Yes, there were logistic and man power problems on full display when I visited their cart the day I went. Unfortunately, they had to turn away many customers because of their lack of ingredients and, to make matters worse, they were short on people so the wait for food just grew and grew and grew. \\n\\nSecond, $6 for a hot dog? Yes, I paid $6 for a hot dog from them and it was freaking awesome! The Chicka Dog was an all beef dog topped with garlic lemongrass chicken, pickle, diakon, cilantro, long pepper, lemongrass aioli, sweet chili spicy mayo, onions, toasted sesame. That's a lot of ingredients, but it mixed so well and it was a very delicious dog! Even though there were so many ingredients, the dog was normal sized. I wish they had cooked a jumbo dog because it would have been so much more worth it then.\\n\\nI'm hoping the truck visits the FiDi again sometime soon because I'm still dying to try one of their burritos as their menu made my mouth water.\", u'This time I went for the tacos. I ordered the fish, chicken, and calamari tacos. And they were pretty delicious - my favorites out of the three are the fish and calamari ones, the chicken one is great and flavorful; but I have a seafood bias. So those are my top choices.', u'An outing into Coney Island with the fianc\\xe9e and what\\'s the first thing we do? Open up Yelp and see what\\'s good out here!\\n\\nYes, there\\'s the original Nathan\\'s Famous stand but I\\'ve had Nathan\\'s. We don\\'t venture out often to Coney Island--shoot, it\\'s our first time--but we wanted to try something good. Something delicious.\\n\\nEnter Coney Shack. You can\\'t argue with its high rating cause it deserves it.\\n\\n(!) WHAT WE GOT: The three taco special: Lemongrass chicken; Vietnamese shortrib; Crunchy fish, and the Holy Phuc hot dog\\n\\n(!) HOW IT DID: The tacos (3 for $9)... oh my goodness, they were amazing! My honeybunny, who\\'s Vietnamese herself, was skeptical and wondered how these Vietnamese ingredients would do on a taco. She, like me, was very impressed by all of them but was pleasantly surprised by the lemongrass chicken. She said she\\'d never been down for a chicken taco but I was like, \"Bebz, have you never tried DelTaco\\'s chicken tacos?? Come on...\" The Holy Phuc ($5), I don\\'t know if it was that we were kind of full already but I thought it was too much.... would\\'ve traded that one for another order of tacos haha.\\n\\n(!) WHERE IT\\'S AT: It\\'s not a flashy stand. Honestly I was worried we passed it or it was closed but it\\'s past the police and fire station. It\\'s located at the end of a parking lot past another food stand.\\n\\n(!) TIDBITS: $9 card minimum, but I presume you could get cash at this store next door but I\\'m not sure. Or better yet, if you don\\'t meet the minimum, order more tacos. You won\\'t have any regrets!', u'Amazing hot dogs and tacos! We happened to be around the area and wanted to eat something quick and small. \\n\\nThank god for Yelp!! My friend found this place and we decided to stop by for a quick bite. We ordered the chicka dog and it was amazing!! I got to try some of the other good stuff like their tofu taco and fish taco and also amazing. This place is a hidden gem and it literally is a small shack! You must check it out!', u'2 words. Fish. Taco! I could have eaten 10 more if I stood there long enough! Also had the lemongrass chicken and the 5 spice calamari (skip this one a little low on flavor compared to the other 2). The spicy Melt was crispy and flavorful, the sauces are amazing, the chefs are super nice. \\n\\nI was shocked there was no wait at a stand like this but it is a ways off the boardwalk and you may not notice it unless you were looking for it. All trips to coney will now include this place too', u\"I missed my chance to go to Coney Shack last summer, back when it was consistently listed as one of the highest rated places in Yelp Brooklyn. So I finally made my way over during the Mermaid Parade. After all, who can turn down Asian fusion tacos?\\n\\nIt's one guy inside a cart parked in an alley next to a convenience store. He was supposed to open at noon, but he was running late and was super apologetic about it. Ended up waiting 20 minutes for him to open, but once he started going, food was coming out quick and it was totally worth it.\\n\\nThey have all sorts of tacos available, at $3.50 each or three for $9. I'm a sucker for a good deal (against my stomach's better judgment), so of course I housed three tacos.\\n\\nI went with the beer battered fish, Vietnamese beef cube shortrib, and the garlic lemongrass chicken. That was the order I ate them in, and also the order of my prference. The fish taco was probably the best fish taco I've ever had. It was fried Asian style, so with tempura for extra crispiness. The lemongrass aioli on top was just wonderful. All the flavors went together really well.\\n\\nThe shortrib taco was good, but was way overshadowed by the fish. The beef was marinated well and the spicy mayo gave it a kick. Would do that one again.\\n\\nThe lemongrass chicken taco was kind of boring, but was a solid taco.\\n\\nLove that they have a ton of hot sauces available for you to use. There's also a picnic bench in the parking lot so you don't have to stand around and eat like a loser.\\n\\nAll in all, the praise that Coney Shack gets is well deserved!\", u'\"HOLD THE DOOR.  HOLD THE DOOR.  HODOR.\"\\n\\nI have found the one place in all of South Brooklyn to bestow my first 5 star review.  This is quality eats for cheap.  A tiny food cart tucked away at the corner of a parking lot(and to the right of the DMV bldg), easily missed, but definitely NOT to be missed, has answered my prayers.\\n\\nThis is a one man show- he answered the phone to give me directions when I got lost(what\\'s new?), he fried me up some fresh fish, and he accepted my offerings of cash & blood.\\n\\nAbout 5-8 minutes later, I was given a heavenly looking delight, the Holy Phuc.  A hot dog topped with beer battered fish, sprinkled with onions, cheddar and layered with tomato basil creole & lemongrass aioli sauces.  My best advice: open your mouth wide.  You need to experience all these ingredients together.  It will deliver a nice roundhouse kick to your face.  The only kind acceptable outside of a Karate Kid movie.\\n\\nAs I was pressed for time, and I mean I was en route to dinner- ha!- I did not get to experience the tacos.  Since they offer the flaky fish covered with crunchy batter in taco form, I\\'d recommend getting that.\\n\\nYou can sit your bum down on one of the few picnic tables and have your day\\'s worth of meals here, or grab and go.  Coney Shack is the reason for the long lines at the DMV.  Did you accidentally shred your license?  Time for a replacement.', u\"I've wanted to try this place ever since I saw the great reviews and pics on Yelp. However, I'm rarely out in Coney Island so it took me a while. I finally had a job out that direction and swung by on a frigid winter night. Its definitely a shack. They were not just saying that. I did see picnic tables behind it. So during the summer you would have a place to sit. Now for the food.I wanted to order everything on the menu. However I settled for a Calimari taco and the Holy Phuc. Wow!! Both were so good. The taco was perfect. The hotdog had so much going on. Some tangy, some salty, a little sweet. I loved it!! I'm rarely in this area. However if I ever am I will definitely be back. If you are even slightly close to this place and hungry I definitely reccomend it!!\", u\"Is this place still open? It's the second time this summer I came all the way to Coney excited to have their food (loved them last summer). Last time there was a concert so you couldn't get in to the food truck without paying cover. Today everything is closed! Yet Yelp says it's open. Please mark this location as closed or update the hours as you are wasting people's time.\", u\"Awesome crunchy fish tacos, best I've had in a while. Not too salty which I like and sauce on top went well with the fish. The caramelized pork is also a hit for me.\", u\"Cinco de Mayo means I need tacos today.. I confess I'm more a traditional Mexican taco type of guy, and was searching for those, but short on time, in the neighborhood, so went out on a limb here.. And do glad I did!! \\n\\nConsider theses tacos the creme de la creme of the taco world. Gourmet style ingredients and combinations that would be entrees at a traditional resturant, portioned out to fill fresh soft tortias. I did an order of the short ribs, garlic pork, calamari, and the crunchy fish.. My favorites were the crunchy fish, which was awesome due to the textures and flavor contrasts of it, I see more of these in my future. The fish was perfect, fresh & crunchy.. The garlic pork being a close second, very flavorful, easily eaten without worry of any tender morsels escaping, a problem I had with the calamari and short ribs.. The calamari themselves were awesome and should be sold by alone, unadulterated.. Maybe with a little dipping sauce.. It's that good. \\n\\nEven though I ate four tacos, I don't feel as if I'm weighted down or binged on junk food, as some taco experiences have in the past. The tacos are topped with all the freshest ingredients, many veggies, so I guess they provide balance to the bolder ingredients, and make me feel I made a heathy choice. \\nDefinitely check them out if your in the area.\", u'I was legit just out here to go to the aquarium, but I got hungry on the way and happened to open up Yelp. Very happy that I did! Coney Shack is not just delicious-- it\\'s fun and creative. So often, \"fusion,\" is weighed down by being pretentious, when it has the opportunity to be fun and irreverent. This is a punk take on korean tacos, which for better and for worse, are kinda their own genre now. These tacos are much, much better than what you\\'ll get at, for example, Korilla, The taco fillings are a cut above-- the pork belly just a little bit crisper, the battered fish just a little lighter and more flavorful, but the composition really sells the whole thing.\\n\\nI also very much enjoyed a hot dog there, the legendary Holy Phuc. It is a little bit of a stunt, with the hot dog and the battered fish and the many toppings, but man, the whole thing really comes together. Highly recommend.'], u'188.Tasty Garden': [u'A Haiku for Tasty Garden:\\n\\nThe dumplings are great\\nThe service is very sweet\\nI wish them good luck!', u\"Not sure if this place is a garden but it certainly is tasty.\\n\\nThey make everything to order and what comes out is mighty delicious and piping hot. \\n\\nDon't pass this place up!!!\", u\"Hell yeah Tasty Garden has it going on!!  Fresh handmade to order quality ingredient dumplings..  Soooo good.  Simple menu - a selection of dumplings (duck, beef, pork, shrimp, veggie..  ) and wontons (shrimp and pork),  noodle dishes (Dan Dan noodles and Peking noodles.. Freaking good!!) and soups. Everything on the menu needs to just get in my belly. I love the homemade quality of the food and simplicity of this cute shop. Tiny shop with a few tables and stools (this is not fine dining everything is served in takeout containers which is just fine by me!).. Tip: if there are no tables and you want to eat right away they'll run your food over to Josie's Bar next door ... Or grab you food and take a stroll toward Ave B and find a bench or table in The Creative Little Garden. Totally reasonable prices for the quality and quantity of the food.  Open 12p- 10p. Go wrap your teeth around some delicious dumplings !\", u\"I can't think of better dumplings in NYC than the dumplings at Tasty Garden and I've lived here my whole life. I walked into what felt like their living room, watching them make super fresh dumplings in the kitchen. The flavors are so fresh and explosive. Get the wonton soup, there are so many wontons in there!!! I always hated how little other restaurants put; but not only are there so many, the quality in each bite reverberates through your entire mouth.\", u'This place is amazing.. first the people in there or super nice and friendly make you feel like you are at home... The food is amazing they make it whit love.. I tried the dumplings and a soup I was surprised how all the flavors explode in my mouth. I fell in love with the place and have to come back to get more.', u\"Great food at REALLY reasonable prices. Open kitchen in be back is almost reminiscent of the Californian In-n-Outs where you can see the food being prepared. In this case, it's a batch of dumplings or perhaps a bowl of wontons; a good bargain for your money either way.\", u'The handmade veggie dumplings were fully filled with a vast array of fresh veggies. Mushroom, carrot, leek, kale, onion, garlic, ginger and more. In a neighborhood full of dumplings this place is a standout. Only my first visit but I will certainly be back.', u\"Real tasty and fresh. No frill menu. I recommend people try it out before they get discovered. No this is not your $2 dumplings but it also don't taste like it. Not oily and overly salty. My wonton came out pipping hot and they tell you to be caution. It is a Chinatown type joint in East Village; clean. Also really homey feeling, makes one felt like I was transported to a village in Asia. They opened recently, so be patience. I would definitely come back.\", u'Delicious, fresh dumplings. Scallion pancakes are awesome. Super friendly service, will definitely go back.', u\"Don't let the modest exterior of the place put you off. The dumplings here are delicious! REALLY DELICIOUS. Hand made, fresh to order. Sometimes it can take a minute because they don't get to the cooking until you order them, but its well worth the wait.\\n\\nInside is only one communal table without much sitting space, but it's cute & homey. \\n\\nAnd the two ladies that work here are Wonderful too! Very nice.\", u'Found this great Dim sum place this Friday.  really like this place and great food.', u\"This place is a gem. We went tonight and sat outside. Great dumplings and amazing food. We normally love Vanessa's, but this place was much better. Very local. Very lovely. Very good food.\", u\"I found out this restaurant last week while I was walking to my home.  Since I can't find one authentic Chinese restaurant like these in flushing, I want to give this new place a try. I am a big fan of dumplings.  It really surprised me that their pork dumpling tasted just like what my mom made.  The meat is fresh, and the size of dumplings are very filling.  I would recommend this place.\", u\"The best dumplings I've had that aren't my grandma's. Everything is home-made, often hand rolled minutes before. Try the wonton noodle soup, come back for the dumplings, and sing the praises of the tastiest garden in alphabet city.\", u\"This place is awesome! Really tasty and authentic.  No msg and they use high quality, fresh ingredients! Probably best dumpling place I've been to in NYC.  Glad I stumbled onto this gem after the original place I was going to for dinner got shut down by the health inspector (Mayanoki).\"], u'161.Cooks & Captains': [u\"This was the 2nd stop on a progressive wine dinner tour hosted by edible Brooklyn. Here we enjoyed a beef Carpaccio served with a chicken liver mousse and presented on a barrel stave. I\\n\\nt was mindblowingly delicious! I don't know if this is a regular offering or if it was just something special for this occasion but it was very creatively and artfully put together. Their staff was of course very accommodating. The space is very wide and beautiful as well. I hope to have the opportunity to stop in here again and have a full dinner!\", u\"You don't often come across establishments that repeatedly and consistently balance great service & delicious food. Cooks and Captain's is definitely one of those rare gems.\\n\\nWe came across this restaurant after my son's birthday party at Prospect Park. My friends happened to walk by and told us to meet them there. Boy was I beyond excited that they did.\\n\\nCasual drinks at the bar turned into a full on 4 hour feast of us trying almost everything on the menu.\\n\\nEverything was so fresh and well balanced. Their vegetable dishes were one of the biggest surprises and my favorite part of my meal. My husband loved the steak and my kids devoured their pasta and chicken. Looking forward to going back again soon.\", u'Great place, but service is S L O W.\\n\\nCame here for brunch Sunday with some friends.  We decided to walk down 5th Ave. and see what looked appealing. We were drawn in by the beautiful decor and ambiance.  There was no wait and we were seated immediately.\\n\\nAs we sat down, we saw various servers running around, but there was only a few other tables in the restaurant and two of them left right after we sat down.  No server came to greet us, so we had to flag one down.\\n\\nWe decided to order the B.A.B.E. (big ass brunch experience), which included brunch cocktails, oysters, a platter of eggs, meat, and other brunch items, and a bread pudding for dessert. \\n\\nWe were still looking around waiting for our cocktails to arrive 20 minutes after being seated (I checked my FB check-in), despite the server and bartender standing at the bar chatting with only one other table in the restaurant.\\n\\nThe brunch cocktails, oysters, and food were delicious.  We finally got the platter 45 minutes after being seated.  Some highlights were the smoked bacon and the bread served with butter and preserves, and perfectly cooked steak.  The B.A.B.E. promised lamb, but we were served steak with no one alerting us to the fact that one of the items had been substituted.  Also, the wording of the potatoes suggested a mashed potato, but what came out on the platter were severely over-fried home fries.  The bread pudding was delicious as well.\\n\\nOverall, this place has the makings of a great restaurant with great decor and delicious food, but to provide some actionable feedback, being more attentive to the customers and moving the meal along would be a vast improvement.', u\"Restaurant has huge, open space so it is wonderful to bring kids and strollers here. I found the food a bit mediocre for the price. I had the bass which I found to be lacking in flavor. My friends loved their food though so perhaps it was just my entree that wasn't good. My friends got the duck and oxtail pasta. Their desserts and drinks were great though!\", u\"Decided to try this new place on 5th Avenue in Park Slope because we were a little tired of our regular spot Mitti Mitti. So we just walked along the avenue looking for a place that would take walkins on a cool, sunny Sunday. Lucky us we were made welcome at Cooks and Captains.\\n\\nAfter about a 10 minute wait as a result of no reservations, we were seated at a 2 top in the main dining room. We immediately ordered a latte and a cappuccino.\\n\\nThe very sweet, polite server, Liliya L returned shortly to take our order and we ordered the pastry basket, fraiche lox, and 2 buttery rotis.\\n\\nStrangely enough the coffees took about 20 minutes to prepare and werr kinda small and kinda meh. Additionally, posted price on the menu was $4 for the cappuccino and $4.50 for the latte. When our bill came later we were charged $5 each. Hmm. I didn't quibble over $1.50, but really? Come on.\\n\\nThe pastry basket was tasty but charred on the top. I mean it was literally black. But I will say this, even charred, it was delicious!! 4 nicely sized fruit pastries. I would order it to go, it was so good.\\n\\nFraiche lox absolutely fabulous. Perfect balance  of salmon, cream cheese and apple slices.\\n\\nThe roti was also great. Slightly crispy, nicely seasoned.\\n\\nOverall I would definitely return to try their dinner menu. The staff is very polite, friendly and eager to please. Space is large, tables aren't jammed against eachother so you make a new friend with every meal. \\n \\nWe got in around 11am on a Sunday without a reservation, but it filled up pretty quickly. I would definitely make reservations in the future.\", u\"I love the farm to table concept, but the food was really just okay. Service and ambience was really great though. \\n\\nPulpo Asado ($16)- 4/5 These were great but they had like 4 pieces of baby octopus and I didn't know it came with meatballs.. This dish was really pretty and tasty! But this is quite pricey for such a small dish.. I would probably recommend Surfish Bistro if you want octopus. \\n\\nPoached Lobster ($18)- 3/5 I usually love lobster but this didn't have much flavor to it. It was a decent sized piece though. \\n\\nFarmer Cheese Mac ($12)- 3/5 I found that this mac and cheese was a bit dry and not cheesy enough. \\n\\nSmashed & Fried Potatoes ($8)- 4/5 These were decent sized and enjoyable. My boyfriend said these were one of the best he had.\", u'Brunch as Cooks and Captains was a shot in the dark today - I guess we didn\\'t do half bad aiming.  I\\'d say 3.5 stars worth of.\\n\\nPretty new restaurant and I\\'d say different than most in the area - very spacious and bright. Lovely ambiance and the live  music was a nice touch.  The staff were great - very friendly and accommodating. The bar looks impressive  - at least that\\'s what I saw from the corner of my eye - the drink menu perhaps could use a bit more work; while I was skeptical about ordering the Brunch Punch and was almost sure about the Gin concoction (orange is what we picked) I was shocked to prefer the first over the second after getting a taste ... very odd sort of sourish-bitter taste that just didn\\'t work for us, my friend was a trooper and finished it anyway haha\\n\\nThe food was interesting ... it was such a mix of \"uuh this is interesting but kinda good\" to \"eh..not sure about this\".  The side order of toast with butter, jam, and peanut butter was totally yummy to start. The shrimp and grits were light and tasty, interesting flavor though. The lox crostini was good too. The favorite was the pancake -  the waitress did give us a heads up that \"it\\'s not your usual pancake\", it was interesting to see just how different. Definitely great mix of sweet and savory. The least favorites of the day were the \"what came first\" and the burger ... the egg dish was a bit too spicy and a bit too busy, the flavors didn\\'t really work for us; the burger - just kind of meh.  \\n\\nI think giving dinner menu a try is definitely a thought. It would certainly help to be able to see the menu ahead of time for both dinner and brunch.', u'This place is AWESOME. You think you decide what to order then come across something even better as you browse the menu. Somehow I \"settled\" (not really because it was delish) I ordered the Sunday ceviche, spicy pickles, boyfriend ordered the shrimp and summer squash grits. We split a house salad. Talk about simply fresh and tasteful. Cocktails were great too. Can\\'t wait to go back for a dinner!\\n\\nGood service too. \\n\\nAlso 5/5 for decor', u\"Had a super disappointing and unfortunate experience here last Friday. After learning Al Di La was closed for renovations, we walked down the street and were awestruck by the beautiful bar and interior, and decided to start the long weekend with a happy hour at the bar before dinner in the formal dining area. \\n\\nWe ordered 1.5 dozen oysters and two drinks. It took nearly 10 minutes for us to flag the bartender's attention despite just 4 other people sitting at the bar. Waited another 10 mins for our drinks (a wine and the frozen hot toddy cocktail, which was pre-mixed and just needed to be poured over crushed ice) to arrive. Then, 40 minutes passed by and we still hadn't gotten our oysters, and when we asked for them, they magically appeared a minute later. The oysters were bland, shriveled, had zero brine, and tasted like someone ran dishwater all over them. They appeared as if the kitchen had shucked them ages ago and the bar forgot to bring them to us. They were also served without either mignonette or lemon, which seems highly unusual for a seafood-focused restaurant.\\n\\nWe thought things might be different after we moved to the dining area but were equally disappointed. The roasted vegetables side was too heavily coated in butter, and the squid ink spaghetti was overly salty for our taste given the butter, olives, and bread crumbs(?) on top. The waitress was attentive when we first sat down, but towards the end of the meal left us waiting for 30 minutes after we'd asked for the check to return with it. It then took another big wait to finally come back with our card.\\n\\nNot sure what the problem was that night (wasn't like the restaurant was PACKED) but the food was definitely not good enough to warrant a return here given the lackluster service and serving us oysters that had clearly been sitting out.\", u\"The food was delicious. So nice to see a restaurant like this in The Slope. Refined, but totally approachable. I was able to meet the owners and they were welcoming and even gave me a tour of the kitchen. \\n\\nI don't remember what kind of fish I had and it doesn't really matter. It was amazingly flavorful. \\n\\nWill definitely be going back.\", u\"Absolutely outstanding food! Didn't have to bring my own coffee to enjoy with my brunch because they have almond, soy, and coconut milks to accommodate my dairy allergy! Ordered the Easy Like Sunday Morning with fried eggs with a runny yolk (most people do not know how to do this - my eggs were PERFECT!!). I truly enjoyed my brunch! The orange juice is so fresh it was like biting into an orange! They serve Toby's Estate Coffee, delicious!\\n\\nThe greeting by Elise the hostess makes you feel like you're somewhere you want to be and somewhere you're going to be taken care of! Caroline, our server was absolutely wonderful! I did NOT have to worry about dairy with her! \\n\\nMany thanks to the entire staff of Cooks & Captains, I will definitely be back!\\n\\nEdit to add: I have been back, multiple times! Cooks & Captains never disappoints whether it is the food or the staff! I love how the whole staff not only treat me, but my toddler niece and infant nephew! I really enjoy the whole experience!\", u'What an awesome spot for brunch! I will certainly be back for dinner. They decor is very much in line with the name; very clean, spacious, a quaint hipster meets New England nautical vibe.\\n\\nI love that on weekends and Friday\\'s there is live music! Seriously just on decor and music alone this place is winning...but it got even better! \\n\\nFor brunch my fianc\\xe9 got the French toast and I went out a limb and tried the Hearth Pancake. I\\'d never had a \"savory\" pancake and the idea of pears and ham together sounded daunting,  but boy am I ever glad I gave it a try! \\nIt was excellent! It\\'s rare that brunch takes on a new feel, the classic standard brunch fare done well is usually enough to make me happy, but this was really quite a new experience for my taste buds! The cheese met the ham, with fruit (pear and another berry I can\\'t recall the name) topping and syrup all on a thin large pancake shaped almost like a thin pie. Even typing this is sounds odd, but try it! My finance\\'s French toast was another winner, with the milk sorbet acting almost like a creme fraiche, but another cool twist on a standard dish.\\n\\nI tired the St Johns cocktail which was also really nice. We shared home fries and they too were really well done, crispy and well flavored. On chatting with our waiter we learned the chef Tristan Epps was on one of the many celebrity chef shows that I missed, but is also Trinidadian and tried to infuse that cultural aspect into the menu. My fianc\\xe9 is half Trini, so another win for us! All around a really great experience and I\\'ll be sure to go back with more of my foodie friends!', u\"This place is amazing, from the decor, to the lighting, to the bar. The hostess to the wait staff was outstanding and very attentive. They are clearly detail oriented. \\n\\nThe food is 5 star quality. I couldn't  figure out all the savory tastes. The plating is picture perfect, the chef is amazing. The wine paired perfectly and the dessert was to die for.\\n\\nI will absolutely add this to our rotation of fancy  restaurants.\", u\"This place has it all. Excellent customer service from start to finish, positively delicious plates, well-made cocktails and a great wine and beer selection to boot. The ambiance reminds me of the Hampton's: upscale, classy, nautical, however, never pretentious. They've managed to pull off elegance while remaining humble. It's a nice really lovely atmosphere. \\n\\nI held my birthday party here over the weekend and everyone positively loved it. In terms of the food, we tried an array of dishes including the octopus, the oxtail, the mac and cheese, the chicken, the shelled bean salad etc. My friends range from Vegan to Carnivore and everyone was satisfied with their meal. They were raving about it actually! \\n\\nAnother detail to note is that I'm a Salsa dancer, and most of my friends are dancers, so while the music was playing we started Salsa dancing and the restaurant was so cool about it! The servers skillfully navigated their way through and cheered us on from the sidelines whenever they had the chance. The other restaurant goers also didn't mind the show. \\n\\nAt the end of the night, my guests were so impressed with Cooks & Captains because of how friendly and attentive the waitstaff is and how positively delicious the food was. It's tricky to host a party upwards of 35 attendees (I think it may have been over 40!) but they handled us with grace, tact and enthusiasm. I applaud their professionalism and eagerness to ensure that I was satisfied and that my guests were all tended to. I'm really so grateful to them for the wonderful experience. \\n\\nThe Salsa band was also incredible! \\n\\nIn short: I highly, highly recommend coming here for dinner, drinks and to enjoy some live music. They are friendly, the food is high quality and the space is gorgeous. I will definitely be back!\", u'My friends and I did Sunday brunch here recently. It was a good ambiance, but mostly empty. We were the first seated because our reservation was for was right when they opened, but not a whole lot of people came in even by 12:30 when we left. New Yorkers must brunch LATE!\\n\\nThe interior is clean, modern, new, and spacious. \\n\\nMy friend and I entered from the doors directly below the Cooks & Captains sign, but evidently the main doors are further to the left, which is a bit confusing. \\n\\nComplimentary croissants were brought to the table, which was welcome given the menu prices. The entrees are priced as New York prices, so nothing to complain about there. I ordered a side of eggs and a side of potatoes for my meal, which was enough. They were both made fresh and tasted great. I also ordered a grapefruit juice, which seemed homemade and not from a carton. \\n\\nThe service was mediocre. Our server was diligent in pointing out some of her favorites and suggestions. I think the servers should ask if diners eat meat before making any suggestions at all.\\n\\nTheir credit card machine was down, so when we received the bill, we were given a sheet of paper to complete our credit card information. That was annoying but not really enough to knock a star away.', u\"My friends and I wandered into here for brunch. This is a new spot in Park Slope so we were excited to give it a shot. There have been several restaurants in this location that have all closed. It seems a bit like a doomed location. Probably because it's so big. \\n\\nWe were told they had to check if there was room for us and the hostess went off the go check the dinning area. She came back and told us she could seat us. When we entered the dinning area, we saw that there were literally 3 tables full in a room with probably 45 tables. I suppose this is a tactic to make them seem very popular and busy, but when we entered the dinning area it just made them look a little stupid to be honest. \\n\\nThe food menu is very small and they have a somewhat interesting cocktail menu. My friends decided to split the rum punch that had something like 3 different kind of boozes and other things mixed in. I got the orange Bloody Mary with mezcal. Both did not taste very boozy but were flavorful. My friend also ordered a Diet Coke, but the server did not tell us that they only serve Boyland's. My friend really didn't like it and asked for a regular Boyland's explaining she didn't like this and thought it was going to be actual Diet Coke. She was still charged for it. \\n\\nThis place is going for a cutesy rustic style so they served all their drinks in mason jars. However, they would bring the cocktail in a larger mason jar that would then be poured into your mason jar you drink from. Milk for coffee was also brought in a small glass milk jar. By the time all of our drinks were brought, we literally had 19 jars on the 4 person table. It was.....a bit much. To say the least. \\n\\nThe menu is small as I said before and there are very little options for vegetarians. Basically every item has some kind of meat on it. So I went with  the kale salad and got a poached egg on top. It was fine but truly nothing special. The kale should have been crispier. It was just missing something. My friends all said the same thing about their food. It was fine but nothing special and it all just felt like it was missing something. \\n\\nWith some tweaks, this could be a great spot. They're gonna need to step up the food though if they want to fill those tables. This si a really huge space and if they want to come out in the black, they're going to need to work on some stuff.\", u\"Amazing meal from start to finish! Love the farm to table. Started with oysters, with an apple celery sorbet- a little odd, but tasted surprisingly great.\\nThe butter roti was the best I've had yet. Hubby had the oxtail, it was succulent, huge portion of meat and perfectly cooked! I had the cod, it was cooked perfectly! \\nThe cherry on top was the panna cotta- holy!!!!!  It's such an unusual combination and presentation, toasted sesame with a tart rhubarb and strawberry sorbet, mixed in with sweet coconut and diced sweet peas. It's blew me away! Kinda wish they will keep this one a regular on the menu... yummmmm!\", u\"We went to Cooks & Captains on a Saturday night, table for two for dinner and I will say it was an overall good experience. They're a newer restaurant & definitely have a handful of areas to tweak, but the food is very good and creative. Doesn't seem like they're afraid to take a chance with their menu. And I like that.\\n\\nTweakable areas: the service & timing. Not that it was bad, just off. The timing of the dishes was off and our waiter did forget a couple of items, but, he was very nice. We ordered two small plates to start with and only one of the two were\\nbrought out... simultaneously with our main courses. We ate and the second small plate still had not arrived - we asked the waiter & he apologized and brought it out after the fact. Dessert was tasty - we ordered a double espresso & an americano. Neither came out until after we were finished with the entire meal. \\n\\nIt's all good... fix these minor and VERY fixable issues & this place will be dynamite.\", u\"Just what Park Slope needs! My Fianc\\xe9 and I were invited to the soft opening and they definitely nailed it. The ambiance is great, the space is well decorated, airy and inviting. \\n\\nThey offer a huge variety of local beers on tap, awesome wine list and a few of my personal favorite of draught wine. If it comes out of a tap it just tastes better! Right? .. I mean I think so. \\n\\nI ordered the crispy lentil appetizer and kale salad. Both dishes flavors were amazing and well blended. If they bottled their miso dressing they used on the salad I would be buying it all up!\\n\\nMy fianc\\xe9 ordered the steak that was a good sized cut, cooked perfectly and came with some delicious roasted garlic that I stole and ate it right up!\\n\\nI'm so happy for our new addition to the neighborhood!\", u\"From the moment we stepped in we were treated great! Hosts were super friendly.The atmosphere was casual/classy. Service was spot on and the staff was very attentive. But most importantly .. THE FOOD! Loved every dish. Definitely would recommend the Chicken Fried Rabbit, Shishitos with Duck, Burrata,Oysters. (i'm pretty sure i just listed everything i ate haha)    i will definitely be back from sure! Excited to check out the Brunch menu as well.\"], u'119.The Binc': [u\"Visited The Binc as a party of three and shared the salmon poke, mac and cheese, artichoke hearts, baby beets, and calamari. \\nThe five small plates were large enough to satisfy our appetite and each plate was tasty. We particularly enjoyed the artichoke hearts and the mac and cheese, especially since they removed/put the pork on the side, and we liked the happy hour cocktails, $8 each. \\nDefinitely worth a visit if you're near Brooklyn heights/dumbo/Clinton hill/vinegar hill.\", u\"It's not a speakeasy - it's a bar - but the drinks they make are very, very good.  We had recently tried Le Boudoir, which was a little disappointing, so we were happy to have good drinks with more substance and balance.  And the fact they have happy hour drink list till 730 on Saturday was a pleasant surprise.   \\n\\nWe ordered from their happy-hour drink menu ($8), and my favorite was their version of Manhattan.  And for our 2nd round, we ordered from their regular drink menu and they were all very good. \\n\\nSince it's a bar, it can get too loud to have conversations since there's background music and all other noises bounce around off the hard surfaces.  \\nAnd their fries are no good.  Very soft and soggy.  But the drinks?  Yay!\", u'As relatively new Brooklyn residents, we\\'re still exploring all the restaurant options in and around where we live. We\\'ve been working our way down Henry Street and finally got to visit The Binc for happy hour and a light dinner. \\n\\nFirst of all, the atmosphere. Very cozy and intimate. It\\'s a relaxing place to enjoy their awesome cocktails. Try the Corpse Reviver #2. Delicious.\\n\\n#2: The staff. Very friendly and helpful and the speed of service was fabulous. This feels like a neighborhood bar where you are treated as a regular even if you\\'ve never been there before.\\n\\nFinally, the food. Every single thing we ordered was really, really good. Not just \"okay\" but amazing! Simple dishes like roasted baby beets, truffle fries, and short rib pastrami tacos were prepared and plated perfectly. \\n\\nSo, to summarize: I think we\\'ve found a favorite new neighborhood spot. We\\'ll be back again soon!', u\"A really neat little tucked away spot for anyone looking for some tasty cocktails and great ambiance. Close to the subway station, and just a short walk from Brooklyn bridge park,  the binc is a perfect place for a couple of drinks before heading home. \\n\\nService is impeccable. When my group and I arrived we weren't sure there would be a spot for us to sit as it was a bit crowded, but they made it happen for us, which I truly appreciate. \\n\\nAs for drinks, take a risk and have one of the bartenders make a special concoction just for you based off of what you like... you won't regret it! These bartenders have such a knack for creativity in mixing drinks, and their attention to detail is impressive. I applaud them immensely. Plus, it's fascinating to see them create a drink for you on the spot. Wish I got the name of our bartender**edit: Richard!** as he deserves to be recognized for such a great experience at the Binc. Loved my arboreal drink, hey! Thanks again for a wonderful night!!\", u\"Great bar with pretty tasty cocktails and tapas but SUPER busy. It's right by the Brooklyn Bridge Park, so a good date spot before a or after a day / night at the park. I recommend if you're near this area!\", u\"A swanky old world cocktail bar with retro black and white hexagon floor tile, intimate, dim lighting located in Brooklyn Heights that offers Happy Hour and small plates.  After attending a poetry reading nearby hunger pangs strike hard as I was enticed for a cocktail and some small plates.  Upon arrival the business appears small similar to a caf\\xe9 size.  I was the sole customer after thirty minutes upon opening the business on a Saturday evening, ergo I was serviced immediately.  My server George was prompt, polite, attentive and made suggestions for cocktail.  Manhattan cocktail is listed in their menu which is an essential basic since the drink originated in New York City in the early 1870s.  Happy Hour is available everyday for cocktails only.  The bill is submitted to the customer embedded in a wine cork with the business's postcard- innovative and a fresh outlook rather than the standard traditional black leather guest book.\\n\\nMexican Mule $8.00- tequila and sliced jalape\\xf1o and ginger beer crushed ice with fresh lime served in a highball.  Drink was ok, nothing to boast for greatness as it was too much crushed ice than the drink main ingredients and I am not a fan of jalape\\xf1o.  I did tasted the ginger beer.\\n\\nTruffle Fries $9.00 -roasted garlic aioli with mayo and ketchup but disappointedly no sea salt.  The portion was abundant which can be shared.  The fries appears very burnt.  In the NYC French fry scene, the golden rods from Pommes Frites are covered in sea salt and served in a white paper cone while competitors use parsley and chives but, disappointedly, The Binc uses neither.\\n\\nPastrami Tacos $14.00 - three short rib pastrami tacos covered in mustard seed a\\xefoli, cornichons, and cilantro with fresh lime.  The meat was extremely dry and somewhat stale or not fresh.  I prefer pulled pork rather short rib.  The cornichons (pickled cucumber) were microscopic small and mustard seed a\\xefoli green spread or sauce was very minimal as I was unable to swallow for the blandness.  I like the soft shell of the taco.\\n\\nNote:  The Binc opens late either 5 pm or 6 pm because they close at 2 am in the morning.  Visa and MasterCard accepted only for credit/debit cards.\", u\"Cool atmosphere and great, unique cocktails. Good music, decor/lighting, crowd. It's loud but you can still have a conversation\", u\"Great bar, with even better bartenders! This is the perfect bar to grab a classy drink and quality food without all of the pretentious nonsense that other NYC haunts make you endure. Drink mixer extraordinaire Richard not only concocts a mean cocktail, but he is a total delight - he is hilarious, but also has a natural gift for anticipating his guests' needs/wants.\", u'I recently went on a cocktail date here. We sat at the bar and ordered a few drinks. Their happy hour ends at 7:30, so we caught the tail end of that. My first drink was a well-made Manhattan. My second was something the bartender made for me after I told him what I liked.  It had scotch and orange something from what I could taste. Either way, it was smoky and I liked his confidence.  My date enjoyed his drinks as well. \\n\\nDrinks, bartender, bar back, atmosphere, all of that would garner 5 stars, but minus 1 star for the sad cheese plate. \\n\\nFrom a cocktail bar, I expected a little more effort.  The cheese plate included 3 pieces of oiled toast, three piles of distinct cheeses, and a handful of toasted walnuts. What it was missing was a jam, a jelly, a mustard, a condiment of sorts to bring the cheese and bread together.  Maybe I especially feel this way because all the cheeses were hard cheeses, not one soft, so it all felt kinda dry. \\n\\nEither way, I would go back if in the neighborhood, or for a cocktail date.', u'Really cool place. Table seating for maybe 20-30 people. Lots of room at the bar and store front window area. \\n\\nNice place to grab some light food and drinks after work or for a date.\\n\\nCozy & elegant atmosphere.\\n\\nService was really amazing, friendly, attentive, super helpful with picking our food, drinks, wine etc.\\n\\nThe burger and calamari were fantastic!!!! \\n\\nWill definitely be returning !', u'This really isn\\'t a bad review at all - promise; as a matter of fact, I\\'d go for 3.5 stars if possible but really, I can\\'t say I was so impressed that I\"m now a huge fan.  It\\'s an intimate and small bar, friendly staff, good for a \"get to know each other\" kind of date.  The food was alright - the meat platter was nice but the truffle fries weren\\'t anything to rave about.  Gin and tonic was really pretty good.  Most memorable part of the evening was the newborn baby being breast-fed at the table next to us - how can one forget that! haha No judgement. \\nOverall, it is a nice place and I\\'d say I\\'d like to go back to try some of their specialty cocktails.', u'Amazing cocktails.  Deviations from the classics.  The perfect neighborhood bar that is not quite a neighborhood bar.  Makes me want to move to the area.  Love the decor and ambiance.  Intimate without being stuffy. Good job.', u'Took a few out of town friends to visit Brooklyn Bridge Park and the Promenade. Came here to grab a bite and some drinks afterwards.\\n\\nI got a Manhattan, it tasted very good and strong. The ladies ordered a specialty Binc Bowl, it had a beautiful presentation as well as taste. Not too sweet, not too strong.\\n\\nFood was on point as well: truffle fries, meat and cheese plates, also got an order of the salmon poke.', u\"Ambiance is low-lit, low-key, swanky cocktail bar. Tables along one wall, and a wraparound marble bar. Service was quick and succinct at 8pm on a Monday, one bartender tending the whole place. I ordered a cocktail from the menu and the burger.\\n\\nIf you remember one thing from this review... the burger is effing AMAZING. $12. Get it before they raise the price. Medium rare. So good.\\n\\nThe first cocktail (High Country, some sort of hot apple cider with funky lavender flavors) was good and sightly on the boozy side. I opted for a daiquiri (not on the menu) as my second, to which the bartender happily obliged. Very balanced and just downright delicious. I'd recommend ordering a classic daiquiri if you come here on Mondays and Thursdays.\\n\\nBottom line: Impressive, sexy ambiance; good food; tasty cocktails. Need I say more?\", u'The pastrami aged tacos were excellent.  The drinks too shelf liquor,  however the ginger over powered the alcohol in my drink.', u\"I've only tried the cocktails so this review is for that. I've been twice. I had a stirred, boozy drink and a shaken one. Both were balenced, though nothing incredible.  I enjoyed the stirred one the most.  However, I took a star off due to the happy hour. Now according to the sign it was buy 2, second drink half off. However the bartender says it is buy 2 drinks get second drink 2 dollars off. He repeated it twice. Now maybe he just got confused. Still if it's on the sign that is outside you would think he would know. I didn't like that. Especially since it was 10 minutes before happy hour ended. So overall I'll give them another try but if you go there for happy hour make sure you ask. Don't just believe the sign.\", u'I have a feeling this is going to become my favorite cocktail bar because then I can say, \"I had to much to drink at The Binc I think.\" This in itself is reason enough to go there, but there are any other redeeming qualities as well. The antique/hipster decor and gentle lighting make for a relaxed and intimate setting. The drinks themselves are excellent, I tried a couple of them that featured champagne. The crowd is all ages, shapes and sizes, but everyone there is very friendly. I will certainly be back', u\"I love everything about The Binc -- creative, tasty cocktails, delicious food, professional service and a welcoming vibe. Also, the lighting is great; it's very romantic and sexy and slightly Miami-esque. Look closely for fun Tiki gear sprinkled around the bar and ask your bartender for a Tiki special drink -- that's what I always get and they make some really delicious concoctions. Bring friends, bring your mom, bring a date!\", u'I arrived at The Binc on a Thursday night around 11 PM at the recommendation of a friend who I was with - she had been a few times before. We went after dinner in the city and I was looking forward to the habanero tequila drink that my friend mentioned loving so much. She also complimented her previous service and both of the bartenders who had served her - having had significant conversation to remember where each were from originally. As soon as we walked in, the bartender made a point to immediately let us know they were \"closing soon\". The bar-back let us know shortly after that closing time was 2 PM. Everything following was reminiscent of the twilight zone. Besides assuming the bartender was high on drugs - or mental - he was incredibly rude. I asked a simple question about the kind of salt on the rim of my glass and Roberto (the bartender) looked at me like I had three heads. We enjoyed our drinks and conversation at the seats closest to the door of the bar while Roberto stood in our corner and texted for a good 5 minutes. After he was done texting, he looked up from his cell phone and awkwardly interrupted our conversation. After telling him we were \"fine\" he AGAIN awkwardly interrupted and sarcastically asked if we wanted any other drinks. We said no. He proceeded to stand and STARE at us so we asked him to leave us alone. Even the bar-back - who was great, friendly and kind - apologized for the behavior and claimed he, too, didn\\'t know what was going on with the bartender, Roberto. Roberto, however, didn\\'t stop there. He stood at the POS station and pointed at each and everyone of us - then got \"on the phone\" and did the same again. He then made another \"phone call\" and acted as his he was speaking to law enforcement. Please let me just reiterate that we did nothing except for order drinks and speak to each other. I had to ask him for our check twice - the second time he reacted as if it was my first request. My friend finally confronted him and asked what his problem was - recapping our entire experience.... Roberto didn\\'t have a response. Not a a WORD. There was something wrong with that man. I\\'m so disappointed especially because I just moved to the neighborhood and was excited to try this place. Needless to say - I will not be back. Good luck to all with Roberto!', u'Cool thanks for promptly providing me with a menu and water at my seat, and then ignoring me for 20 minutes. The water was great though. (Bonus star for previous good experiences.)'], u'16.Norman': [u\"I came here for the Taste of Iceland dinner tasting menu that was running for just four days in October. Technically, the menu was not constructed by the chefs at Norman, but by Icelandic chef Viktor \\xd6rn Andr\\xe9sson, but I had such a wonderful experience imma rate Norman five stars anyway.\\n\\nFirstly, the decor of this place is stunning. It quietly impresses you with its Scandinavian influences - vast, uninterrupted space, high ceilings spiderwebbed with pipes, beams, and hanging pendant lights. Floor to ceiling windows wrap around this corner restaurant, bathing it in light. There is a long picnic bench that looks fit for a feast. The kitchen is open so you can see the chefs working/ It's rare to find a restaurant this spacious, and perhaps that's why it's in slightly inaccessible Greenpoint.\\n\\nThe food I had was top notch. All four courses were thoughtful and high quality, and reminds me very much of my meal at Germanium in Copenhagen but at a fraction of the price. I don't want to wax lyrical about a tasting menu you won't be able to get anymore, but Norman's regular menu looks pretty Nordic as well. I would certainly come back and see if they can serve up a smorgasbord that takes me back to my travels in Europe.\", u'Hake was flavorful and filling.\\n\\nBread so so delicious.\\n\\nCabbage decent.\\n\\nThe ambiance here is hipster industrial brutalism. \\n\\nFree sparkling h20 a nice touch. I love seltzer.', u\"Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon for lunch - was definitely a good choice! Norman's morning sandwiches were eggy, creamy and delicious, and were well worth the trek around Brooklyn. Scrambled eggs on both sandwiches ordered were lightly scrambled, soft and fluffy. If you like kombucha, definitely also order a house made glass. \\n\\nOverall service was quick, and there was little to no wait. Would definitely try to come again.\", u'KenScale: 8.5/10\\n\\nI\\'ve always been partial to the minimalist sensibility of the Scandinavian region in northern Europe (yes, I still need to make a trip to countries like Denmark and Sweden at some point in my life, hopefully soon), and the moment I walked into A/D/O in Greenpoint, Brooklyn with my wife Jun, the large open design space at a former warehouse immediately appealed to me, and I just wanted to hang out with Jun sipping a glass of wine while lying down on the comfy soft in the center of the area. Well, our mission this time was check out the restaurant inside that gorgeous space so we proceeded to the dining space. I know modern Scandinavian / New Nordic cuisine hasn\\'t quite got the draw in New York City compared to the world outside the U.S., but I was still shocked that the restaurant was nearly empty. After all, this is a collaboration between Claus Meyer, one of the founders of Noma, and Fredrik Berselius from Aska that won almost every single best new restaurants of the year awards out there in recent years. Is it because of the somewhat in-the-middle-of-nowhere location (the restaurant is located on a quite street on the border between Williamsburg and Greenpoint) or is the place supposed to get a lot more crowded during daytime (we showed up on an early Sunday evening)? I couldn\\'t tell but in any event, I felt it was a shame that the restaurant wasn\\'t getting much love because the food at Norman was overall fantastic.\\n \\nCarrying on the spirits of Noma and Aska, there were pleasant surprises from many dishes leaning toward modern Scandinavian even though Norman was supposed to be a more casual version compared to the either two. After warm wheat sourdough with cultured butter and root vegetable salt, we ordered two small plates and two larger items. Jun and I had thought the server would bring the small plates together first but he actually mixed and matched each small plate with a large dish, and it turned out to be a smart call. \"I really wish this dish had less salt; otherwise, this could\\'ve been a perfect dish.\" Jun kept musing while scooping up the red corn porridge with fermented green tomato and blue oyster mushroom, and I couldn\\'t agree more. The crunchy texture of the porridge was quite memorable, but indeed the seasoning of the dish made it hard for us to keep going after half a dozen scoops. On the other hand, silver hake with yellow-eyed beans and blistered kale was more balanced in flavor, and the fish quite aptly cooked. The second set of dishes is where things got a lot more interesting. When we ordered, we debated between pork collar and New York strip. The server noted that pork collar may not be for everyone if you are looking for a tender piece of meat, but we were both feeling adventurous and ordered the pork collar anyways. What an awesome dish this turned out to be. Contrary to the server\\'s warning, the meat was very nicely prepared with an ideal texture for pork, and it worked wonders with charred cabbage with fresh cheese, hazelnuts and gooseberries that we ordered as a second small plate item. If there is such thing as the best pairing of a main dish and a side, I would highly consider this pair for the wondrous complexity of flavor and texture all over the place with different ingredients. For dessert, buttermilk curd with rhubarb honey and crunchy ymerdrys (a type of Danish rye bread topping) sprinkled on top of it was an awesome finish to the meal for its delightful flavor without overpowering sweetness.\\n\\nAs I noted above, getting a reservation won\\'t be an issue at Norman given how empty the dining space was during our visit (or perhaps things might be different during prime times on Friday or Saturday?). There is full bar with a concise selection of cocktails and beers (I would kick off a meal with a glass of aquavit). The bright and hip setting of A/D/O will only add to your pleasant experience at Norman, although perhaps the presence of some diners in the dining space would make you feel more like you\\'re eating at a restaurant and not at some deserted warehouse. I highly encourage curious New York City diners to venture out to Brooklyn to give Norman a try. The casual yet sophisticated take on modern Scandinavian / New Nordic cuisine will surprise you.', u'I started a review of this place before ...where did it go?! ... my sister and I visited Iceland in March 2017 and fell in love with the food! The fine dining experience every where we went was superb.. so when we heard the chef from the Blue Lagoon was in NY and for a few nights we leapt at the chance to take part in his event. We had three dishes ... tuna two ways, langoustine two ways and lamb two ways. Norman hosted the event and it could not have been a better venue! Perfect fit! The decor is modern and inviting. The bathrooms clean. The service was excellent and the chef, as you already heard, superb. 20% tip and full tummies later with no regrets!!! Hoping to visit again soon under similar circumstances', u\"This place is awesome. \\n\\nI came here on a Sunday night around 8pm with a friend and was shocked by the space. It's so big, open, and airy. On the left side is the kitchen and dining area. On the other there's some interesting seating that you can kinda lie down in and loop into the skylight. Then further back is an open workspace, and even further back outside is an outdoor art thing.\\n\\nMy friend and I opted for bar seating and started with the rhubarb daiquiri ($15), and the the food began.   \\n\\nBread - do it for the butter. You might wonder why you're paying $5 for bread when most places just give it to you, but once you taste it with the butter you'll understand. This huge loaf is light on the inside and a good crisp on the outside. The butter is a totally different story though. This sourdough is also not as sour as other ones I've had - which is a good thing imo!\\n\\nLiver pate toast ($13) - This was delicious, though I will say I've had better.\\n\\nCheese plate ($16) - I'm a fan of soft cheeses so I asked if we could get a plate of that. Though I don't remember which ones he selected, he did a great job at explaining the age, textures, and what hints we'll taste. Our waiter/bartender was so kind and gave us a wine to pair with this on the house.\\n\\nButtermilk curd ($8) - soft and light and subtle flavor.\\n\\nI would definitely come here again and recommend to a friend!\", u'Outrageous soaring dining/ design space by Claus Meyer and partner Federik Berselius. Set in an enormous garage like spot on Norman Avenue bordering Williamsburg. Be transported by design, open kitchen, marble counter and gracious service. Breakfast lunch and dinner. Pastries and coffee are here all day, and newly reopened I went for lunch. A daily lunch plus soups, sandwiches like slow roasted pork and salads are available all day. \\nAte:\\nDaily lunch $15\\nPoached hake, crispy potatoes, mussels, over mushroom base served with a watercress salad, with marinated turnip. plus Oland wheat bread made in house, and butter. The presentation on a wood tray with blue striped napkin was pure Scandanavian comfort. Hot, cooked to order- wow! The mushroom was super and a the dishes were delicious.This is truly a unique and delicious dining experience in NYC!', u\"Over the weekend a friend suggest we meet up over a casual brunch somewhere in Williamsburg. I've walked by Norman countless times on my way to other places in the area and was happy when she suggested it so I could finally experience for myself what it would be like to eat in this modern-looking establishment.\\n\\nWhen you walk in you instantaneously realize how open and big of a space the actual restaurant is located in. From first glance it looks as if the spot shares an open room with a work space and coffee shop all under the same roof. We were told we could sit at whichever table we like and would be served shortly. My friend and I chose a table near the window.\\n\\nDuring our time there, there was only one other set of people eating at the restaurant as well. It had been a particularly warm Sunday in the summer so I didn't think much of it.\\n\\nWhen it came to order I was surprised at the lack of options that were presented that we could chose from for brunch. I ended up going with their version of French Toast while my friend ordered the Breakfast Sandwich with scrambled eggs, Havarti and sausage.\\n\\nOverall the dish I had was particularly bland. Lacking in flavor and the sides it was served with didn't help to compliment the toast it was served with. My friend enjoyed her dish and it seems I would've been better off choosing something else.\\n\\nI give this place three starts because even though the food wasn't as good as I expected our server was extremely attentive throughout our entire time there. I'd give this place another chance, maybe for dinner or lunch, but I would think twice about coming here for brunch in all honesty...\", u'We had such a wonderful time at Norman for dinner! Our favorite things included the bread and butter, the strip, the hake, the porridge and definitely do not skip out on dessert. The sorbet was creamy and delicious. \\n\\nI have been to Norman for breakfast, lunch and dinner and it has never been anything less than perfect :) I highly recommend this neighborhood spot.', u\"From the interior space, casual atmosphere to their delicious selection of breakfast sandwiches and mouth watering pastries, this can easily be considered the neighborhoods next most desired dining spot. Although dining is redefined here as the majority of the crowd I found working with their laptops seemed to be the norm.\\n\\nI've passed this location a few times in Brooklyn but didn't realize what it had to offer. Once I walked in, I didn't even imagine the space to be so immense. This place screams that Scandinavian influence in an industrial warehouse, considering the size and it gives off that Chelsea gallery vibe especially as you walk out to the back courtyard. \\n\\nI would recommend the soft scrambled egg with havarti and bacon! I must come back here for dinner. MUST.\", u\"This review is for the dinner service.\\n\\nFor someone who does not frequent Brooklyn in general, I was pleasantly taken aback by my experience at Norman. \\n\\nThe food was healthy, incredibly fresh, unique, flavorful and delicious. Exceeded expectations (the hake is particularly exceptional). I'd consider the portion sizes to be similar to tapas, although they are slightly larger than your traditional tapa.\\n\\nI'd classify the decor as modern-industrial. The space is rather large and can fit large parties. From being seated to finishing dessert, my experience has been a great one, with the exception of the long wait time from the first two dishes to the remaining four. We must have waited about 40 minutes between the first two to the remaining four. \\n\\nWould definitely re-visit.\", u\"Everyone who works here is so nice. The space is beautiful and the food is good, I've only ever had breakfast and got the Salmon sandwich with pickled beets and it was great. \\n\\nYou can sit inside or outside, and they have a full bar. Everything is awesome\", u\"I received a prompt apology from management after this post, which is the only reason I'm adjusting my review from 1 star to 2.  I don't think this experience should've happened, and I shouldn't have to post a negative review to receive an acceptable response.  I hope the restaurant learns from this and tries to do better in the future.\", u\"Spacious enough for strollers and great chill ambiance. \\nThis place is great if you love dill as it's a highly used ingredient in most of its dishes (i.e. salad). I highly recommend the any of the baked goods and the slow cooked eggs. I would avoid the pickled vegetable appetizer.\", u\"Excellent! We had the hake, bread and a round of pickled vegetables. The bread is served warm and comes with a delicious cultured butter - very spreadable. Really good. The fish was moist, flaked perfectly - very pleasing light flavor. It's served with smoked greens and beans- tasted great together. I confess to being Not always a healthy eater so if you're thinking you may not have fun without lots of fried food, don't worry. These dishes have that satisfaction. Cool building and interior design too. Staff was very attentive without being intrusive.\", u\"I've only been for breakfast but enjoyed the pastries, egg sandwich, and yogurt. The staff is super friendly and so nice to my kid. There's also lots of room for a toddler to wander around. Love the Scandinavian design.\", u\"Came here on a sunday night. The ambience was perfect, food was delicious, and the service was impeccable. We got the cheese, bread, mixed green salad, porridge, and steak. Everything was amazing. I was reminded of the food I had when I was in Copenhagen. The porridge reminded me of Grod and some of the dishes reminded me of Relae. We also got a couple cocktails, which were unique and refreshing. We got the green apple sorbet for dessert-- it wasn't what we were expecting, but still a perfect way to end our meal. Overall, I would go back!\", u'Really good. Love the egg sandwich with sausage; however, I really wish they soft scrambled their eggs rather than fold them the way they do. You take a bite and the whole sandwich falls out the back. Just asking for a little more traction on my sandwich.', u\"Norman is Greenpoint's newest gem, shining with a combination of creative and innovative ambience that also pays tribute to the neighborhood industrial identity. Norman offers a simplistic menu that incorporates well-thought out balance through best quality ingredients and flavor profiles. Its collaborative and inviting social atmosphere makes this a popular location to come again.\", u\"I must have walked past Norman's storefront three or four times before deciding I had to stop inside to see what was going on at this relatively obscure storefront a few blocks north of the William Vale Hotel. The facade is actually somewhat intimidating; I actually didnt realize it was a restaurant after the first few stroll-bys as I considered that it may have been some other kind of event space pop up, cafe/co-working space, etc.\\n\\nThe reality is none of the above - restaurant norman is the newest iteration in Claus Meyer's continuously growing portfolio of successful scandinavian restaurants. Unlike many of his other ventures and similarly to the Norther Food Hall he is opening up near Grand Central, Norman is priced affordably for the everyday diner. \\n\\nThe menu at Norman is relatively focused, which is not a bad thing. I went there looking for some small plates to share with my partner and was really impressed at the range of interesting food options to choose from. Standouts for me included the homemade bread and the scallops + apple. I am excited to come back and try their other offerings and I am very impressed that they plan to be open for all meal hours. \\n\\nRegardless if you are in the area for an upscale intimate dinner, a place to do work and get a coffee, or a place to get some small bites and drinks with friends, Norman appears to cast a wide net suitable for all dining categories.\"], u'36.Strange Flavor Burger Shack': [u'I got the Hot Fried Chicken Sandwich & fries. The sandwich was a little greasy & messy, but soooo much better than I had anticipated. I\\'m not much of a \"ranch person\", but their ranch plus the cilantro on the sand which was very tasty. The fries were good as well, & the spicy ketchup was excellent!', u\"Very good fast food takeout type of spot.  I especially like the fried chicken sandwich, but haven't had a bad dish yet.  Definitely worth a shot if you feel like a late night munchy, and happen to be having a drink at one of the many nearby bars.\", u'Love the food! Both the chicken sandwich and pop burger were awesome. (Skip the bar in the back, food is the main attraction here)', u\"Without the slightest exaggeration SFBS has the best vegan chicken sandwich I had all year. I started this draft in December of last year and since it is now only February this statement holds a little less weight but nonetheless this place still rules. I took a chance after seeing it on Grubhub with very few reviews. I got my food and was totally blown away and I continue to have big bulging anime heart eyes for SFBS with each of my visits and deliveries since. \\n\\nI have had the vegan chicken sandwich mentioned earlier, the animal-style fries w the very yum house-made spicy ketchup and the vegan bang-bang which is similar to the vegan wings if you're on Yelp and confused why wings aren't on the menu like I was but I think maybe they are just prepared differently now. As they are prepared now, an order of vegan Bang Bang consists of three crispy-skinned but juicy on the inside drumsticks bathed in a Szechuan peppercorn sauce. It is the bar food of my sloppy wet dreams. Would be extra perfect on top of some brown rice but that's only so I don't embarrass myself by licking the paper boat it's served in. \\n\\nGood folks, good service, good food. Can't ask for more.\", u\"Got the brisket and it was so good! The veggies taste extremely fresh too and sandwich all in all doesn't taste too greasy, which is also good when it comes to a burger\", u\"A food truck located at the front of the Johnson's provides delicious food, and fun flavors! I love the burgers (especially the chop burger) and the chicken sandwiches. A tip: skip the french fries and go for the long bean tempura! Mmmmm!!\", u'I had so much fun here. Tried their burger and it was all awesome. The staff was kind and very prompt to all your needs. Animal style fries was fantastic. I would love to go back here and check their other options.', u'The bang bang chicken was decent, the crispy fried chicken meshing well with the sweet and sour house sauce. On the other side,  extremely disappointed with the \"Housecut Fries\". It was obviously re-fried old french fries (soggy and greasy)  and I had to throw most of it away. For $4.50, I definitely expected much more.', u'The burger is pretty solid but the service last time I went into have a burger at 3pm was completely rude. Tried to contact the Shacks owners but no response via fb or email. They have it posted that they open at 3pm on yelp/google and even right next to where you order and the girl working was just rude. I been going here since they opened @3pm to get my lunch and all of a sudden they are not open until 4 or 5pm? even tho its posted they are open at 3pm? wtf the girl working told me to leave and shes arguing with me they never open at 3pm. Get your facts straight burger shack and train your employees to be kind to your customers. I pointed to the sign that says they open at 3pm next to her  and she just told me \"you can leave now\" rude. The owners seemed so nice but this new hire is making me not want to come back ever.', u\"#I came because the pictures looked really good. I couldn't decide between the Fried Fish Sandwich which looks really good or a burger. The cook/server recommended the Pops Burger (double patty). I don't think it was a good recommendation though. The patty had a weird texture, like the meat was threaded or fibrous ...think #Big Bubba Burgers from your grocer's freezer. It also had like a teriyaki flavor to it.\\n\\nI think the #Fried Fish Sandwich would have been a better recommendation.\", u'I ordered the chicken coated in their famous hot sauce and the animal fries. It was delicious! The sauce was very unique. The only thing that could be improved is portion size. Gimme more chicken !', u\"Well I was hoping to come back to write a good review but that's not the case. I decided to give them another chance and get delivery about an hour earlier than my previous attempt. \\n\\nI spent most of the night on the phone with yelp because once again this restaurant didn't answer their phone. This time my food arrived, but it was 2.5 hours late when I had already given up and gone to sleep. \\n\\nThe food probably would have been good if it weren't cold, but even then I don't know if it would be worth the cost. \\n\\nSeems like a fine place to stop in but don't place a delivery order if you like warm and timely meals.\", u'holy vegan meat sandwich!!! stopped by the booth at smorgasburg, got a half for $9. FLAVOR EXPLOSION!! i loveee daikon and cilantro together, nice touch guys!! totally memorable and worth going back for!!', u'OK I had another good experience here, so it is about 50/50 now. Just wish the quality is more consistent...', u\"Had no idea that the Johnson's, my favorite neighborhood bar, had food. Great find!\\n\\nThe chicken sandwich is stacked and the long bean tempura is delish. Must try! Strange Flavors indeed...\", u\"I literally can't get enough of this place. The vegetarian options are the most flavorful things I've had in New York. Period. The veggie chicken sandwich has become an addiction and the animal style fries, long bean tempura, veggie wings are all so rich in flavor and texture each bite is a heavenly experience. \\n\\nNow they are doing delivery and I don't think I can resist eating this amazing stuff every day. \\n\\nBest place ever.\", u\"I would give this a 3.5 if I could. The chop burger was one of the best burgers I have had. HOWEVER, the size of it was not worth $10. If it was $12 and came with fries, I would pay that. If it was $7.50 on its own- that feels right. That said, I'll likely eat this burger again.\", u\"The chicken sandwich was spot on!! Enough where a friend of mine ordered it and I couldn't resist the smells coming off of it... my friend went out for a cigarette and I stole 3 bites off of the sandwich. Asian inspired and so crunchy and moist with each bite: afterwards I had to buy another sandwich. If you are looking for a chicken sandwich in Bushwick this should be the first place you stop at... if not you are missing out. I'm down one star just because all their other dishes take too much cilantro.\", u\"Wow the fries and burger... If you could taste magic then this is it. For anyone who wrote a bad review on this place  don't take your rejection on tinder out on this place. I'll definitely order again.\", u\"Burger is good, but don't go there hungry because the food takes forever to get to you.\"], u'70.Traif': [u'My husband has been wanting to try this place for quite a long time, so I finally made reservations for our wedding anniversary. We treated ourselves to a couple of cocktails and the Chef\\'s Selection menu. The majority of the menu is made up of small dishes for sharing like dim sum or tapas. The servers were charmingly attentive, but luckily, didn\\'t hover. The primary server asked if we were adventurous eaters to which we replied, \"Very much so!\" The dishes came out of the kitchen in quick selection, and the chef must have read my mind because he sent out everything I was hoping to try and even ones I hadn\\'t, but I\\'m glad I had. Everything was delicious, balanced, and inventive. It was all of the aspects of a fine dining experience, dinner bowls, plate switches, never empty water glass, etc. in not stuffy environs. The Chef\\'s Selection includes two desserts. The collection of dishes were a perfect amount of food. We went home smiling with perfectly satiated bellies. In a whim, we asked for a copy of the menu, and they sweetly obliged with chips of the cocktail and dinner menus.\\n\\nTIP: If you plan to try several dishes the Chef\\'s Selection is the best deal.', u\"traif has incredibly positive reviews and i was initially drawn to the restaurant by these - and the outrageously affordable tasting menu. because of these factors, i chose traif to have my birthday dinner with my mom. there are parts of the meal i loved but overall would not say it lives up to the hype. \\n\\nwe both ordered the tasting menu and 4 drinks (three glasses of wine and a cocktail between us). the tasting menu had about 8 courses and 2 desserts. honestly, by the seventh course i was praying there wouldn't be any more food. as the name references, all the dishes are meat or cheese. during the course of the meal we had salmon, duck, pork belly, ribs, scallops, fois gras, and bacon. the two cheese courses were burrata and gnocchi. there was one salad course. the food was very overwhelming and on the heavier side but overall well cooked and very tasty.\\n\\nmuch has been written about the positives of traif so i'll stick with the things that surprised me during the meal. the restaurant does not have a wine by the glass list; they seem to just have some wines that are open. there were no prices or information about these wines. also, we had to repeatedly ask the kitchen to slow the plates down. at a certain point they were bringing plates like every 5-8 minutes. sadly, when we asked them to slow down they would just wait longer and then bring two plates at once.\\n\\nthere is little to complain about cuisine wise at traif; they clearly know how to cook the items offered on the tasting menu. all and all, i am not sure i would return due to the service missteps and the overall heaviness of the meal.\", u\"Traif's menu can seem overwhelming with all its diverse options for small plates. Party of 2?\\n Order 3-4 dishes. Party of 4? Order 5-6. You get the idea. \\n\\nTruthfully, you can't go wrong with any of their dishes. Their vegetable dishes at the top of the menu list were the stars for us, surprisingly. Tons of flavor! The popular sliders dish was good, not great. Their prawns dish was HUGE. Our server was attentive, knowledgable, and friendly. \\n\\nOnly drawbacks are the subpar cocktails and rushed service.\", u\"This place is a great value if you're looking for an affordable tasting menu with a total of 9-10 courses for only $55 per person. I contemplated about giving this place 3.5 stars vs 4 stars for a few different reasons but mainly because the dessert took a totally wrong turn. All the savory dishes we ate starting with the strawberry gazpacho down to the foie gras topped with a soft egg were absolutely sublime and the service was great as everything was perfectly timed and each course came out in a timely manner. When we got to dessert we waited an unusually long time for it to be served (20-25min). First, we were served a sickly syrupy diabetic store-bought looking key lime pie, my husband and I almost barfed after the first bite as the amount of sugar literally almost knocked us out our tiny wobbly plastic chairs we couldn't believe we waited 20 minutes for such a disappointment, 3 minutes after being served the key lime pie to our surprise they brought us yet another dessert and this was a sesame seed panacotta, while this was not overly sweet we both agreed it was also a huge disappointment as the flavor profile simply didn't work and the sort of soy sauce tasting glaze it was served with was just yuck.  My husband and I both agreed we probably would have given this place 4.5 stars had they just ended with the savory dishes and skipped the dessert courses because everything else was excellent.  \\n\\nWe took a few points off for the following reasons:\\nA - The dessert \\nB - The Place is really tiny and cramped with tiny plastic chairs\\nC -  Very loud as you cannot  hear the person sitting across from you or the waiter explaining what each dish was\\n\\nFinally we thought about taking off points for the long 20+ minutes wait for the dessert course but didn't because without hesitation or prompting or any complaints from us the waiter offered to comp our drinks for the inconvenience which I thought was pretty awesome so he totally earned his 18% tip.\\n\\nTo sum it up - would I recommend this place? Yes\\nWould I return? Most likely yes , probably for lunch when it's less busy\\n\\nLastly I think I may have had an allergic reaction to something I ate as I started itching within a few hours of leaving and broke out into hives but I don't think this is any fault of the restaurant probably just me eating something that didn't agree with my body as my husband and I ate the same thing and he is fine.\", u\"Made a last second reservation at 7:30 but were told we could only stay until 9:00. It wasn't a big issue since the food is serve very promptly and eating tapas with four people means a quick finish. Their menus change often, so we weren't sure what we wanted until we got there. Luckily, out of the many things we ordered, everything was a hit! Their dishes are very interesting with the ingredients and it was surprisingly good and harmonious. I'd come here again and try more stuff, it is just great because the difference in menus makes a large variety of dishes available and allows adventurous people to have something new each visit. \\n\\nThe bill came out to be ~$240 for four, not exactly cheap but we ordered quite a bit! (We ordered more food than shown in pics)\", u'Was visiting NY for the weekend. This place was close to where I was staying. Had the short rob sliders. They were delicious. Would recommend to others.

It was a 10-Course Globally Inspired Feast. Ever since I joined Tasting Collective, the name Traif kept coming up as everyone's favorite restaurant event. And this is a diners club of food lovers, I had to go and try it out!\\n\\nThe interior is simple and industrial, chilled, and with very cool, modern, abstract art decor throughout. I liked the mix of straight and curved lines, minimal but yet distinctive colors, simple furniture and warm, soft light inviting customers in. They had a very lovely patio in the back. I really liked it here, it had more natural light coming in before the Sun went down, and then lit up with festive string lights. They had good amount of greenery around it that made the space even more relaxing.\\n\\nWe started off with a couple of drinks. We chose Yuzu Kosho and Drink Like its Spring. They were both very tasty, high quality and strong. For food, we got to try Crispy Sweetbreads, Cured Fluke Sashimi, Dry-Aged Venison, Roasted Berkshire Pork Belly, Roasted Rainbow Carrots, Salt & Pepper Hamachi Collar Wraps, Seared Scallops & Risotto, Smoked Lamb Puttanesca Cavatelli, Toasted Pistachio Budino, and Warm Sugar Maple Pie. All these dishes, one word: Amazing!!!\\n\\nI now know the reason why this is the most popular spot among the Tasting Collective members. My taste buds were having the time of their lives the entire night! I would love to go back again for more of their amazing dishes! Read my full review of the restaurant and food on my food blog, foodlovergirl.\", u\"Josh was theee best server!\\n\\nTraif has been on my list for years at this point, but I never found myself willing to trek to the Billy Burg just to try it. Shame on me.\\n\\nWe came for our anniversary and sat inside. My boyfriend was able to get reservations just a day in advance. Having scoured Yelp already for all the good dishes to try, I already had a pretty good idea of what I wanted. \\n\\nWe ordered the Tuna Tartare, Cinnamon Ribs, Gnocchi, Pork Belly, and Scallops. The tuna tartare was amazing and easily the best thing we ate the entire night. I wish we had ordered two of them. Our second favorite dish was the scallops with corn risotto. It was also delicious, and the scallops were perfect! Everything was great and if I could re-do my entire meal, it would be only to order less drinks and more food so I could have tried more.\\n\\nI'm definitely coming back, Traif!\", u\"Amazing food and amazing service, my wife and I came here for our first ever tasting menu back in 2013 and came back recently again to celebrate our 1 month wedding anniversary. \\n\\nThe food is spectacular and to have a tasting menu at the price of $55 per person is phenomenal. There are approximately 10 - 11 dishes (if we can remember correctly :)) and each one will tease your palette with an explosion of flavors.\\n\\nOur favorite go to dish is definitely the Tuna TarTare. It is served on top of eggplant tempura and we always order this as a full dish on top of the tasting menu because it is so good!! But don't get me wrong, every dish we have had is amazing as well - you can't go wrong with Traif.\\n\\nOverall I have been here 3 times and i can say for sure that i will be back!\", u'The name \"Traif\" comes from a Yiddish term for forbidden foods like pork and shellfish, which are celebrated in abundance here. All the dishes are tapas-style and perfect for sharing, and whether you\\'re dining solo or in a group, you can make a good meal out of several dishes.\\n\\nTo start, a shot of butternut squash soup, on the house, helped cleanse the palate. Next, a serving of burrata, topped with strawberries and beets, was an alternately savory and tangy way to start the meal. Then came three heavier dishes: a spicy tuna tartare paired with tempura eggplant, a sinful serving of seared pork belly, and an utterly decadent helping of fried chicken, biscuits, and gravy. Oh soooo good. \\n\\nThe cocktails are on point as well, and it\\'s surprising that such a busy restaurant, where there\\'s not only a main dining room but also an outdoor patio, can be manned by so few staffers. Indeed, the open kitchen fits entirely behind the relatively small bar counter. Nevertheless, the dishes here are creative and satisfying, and it\\'s well worth a visit.', u\"Everything associated with love is magical, and Traif is all about that magic. The couple Jason and Heather met each other while working in a restaurant in San Diego and decided to open up their own place after traveling around - this was how Traif came into being.\\n\\nRather than calling it down-to-earth, I'd like to describe it as rustic. Open kitchen took majority of space inside and one could easily tell what is going to be the next dish. Plates were small and designed to be shared easily. \\n\\nWe went with that beloved tuna tartare, with the marinated tuna sitting quietly on that piece of fried eggplant. While in general I would complain about the greasiness coming out of the crust, this time I only found it tasty. The blue crab with uni and smashed potato was another high light of the night, with each piece of crab meat, jumbo in size and tender in texture, buried perfectly beneath the potato pur\\xe9e. Duck breast was usually my go-to dish whenever I saw it listed on the menu, and I must admit, the duck breast from Traif was heartily prepared, well marinated, and perfect in texture. \\n\\nI guess I felt kind of sad when dinner concluded at Traif, and this only motivated me to go and visit their sister restaurant Xixa just a couple of meter away down the street. Traif certainly has some minor points that I cannot appreciate (their cocktail tastes a bit weird), yet I found myself enjoyed the whole experience from the beginning to the end. \\n\\nThank you Jason and Heather, I felt it.\", u\"Traif you are insanely delicious. There's so much to say but hard to put it all into words.\\n\\nDon't think twice and get the Chef tasting for $55 (start with 1 amuse bouche, 9 tapas style courses, trio of 2 desserts) along with the wine pairing +$35 and you will walk out full, tipsy and happy as a clam!\\n\\nEvery course is really quite excellent. This is one of those spots where it really is best to leave it up to the chef!\", u\"This is a great place to take a date. The ambiance was soothing and the overall food choices were pretty good. We thought about the tasting menu but then opted for our own choices. The best were the strawberry cinnamon glazed ribs then the uni over eggplant. The snap peas were a little on the salty side. We got this shot of I forgot but didn't take a picture of it but got a second dose of it and it was refreshing. \\n\\nCheck this place out. The neighborhood may not look clean but definitely safe to walk around as I was visiting this hip neighborhood\", u\"I've been wanting to come to Traif for a while and finally made it with a friend.  They have a very reasonable tasting menu, $55, but we decided to go a la carte.  The carrots are a must have.  Venison tartare with heirloom tomatoes and blue cheese was a new dish on the menu and great.  The eggplant dish was very tasty but I didn't need for it to be fried.  The gnocchi was excellent.  The gnocchi themselves were good, nothing special, but the mushroom sauce and mushrooms made it a must have dish.  The duck breast was quite good.  We saw so many sliders come out that we decided to get them.  Not special but perfect pulled pork sliders.  It's a cute space.  We sat at the bar which was fun to sit at the kitchen.  They're a well oiled machine.  Servers and staff are friendly.  Pacing is a bit faster than normal, but was good.  My main criticism would be that the sauces, while different, had some similarities, which made it seem a bit repetitive.\", u'Traif\\nNY BK Willy B\\n6pm Tuesday 3rd January 2017\\nFour Stars\\n\\nTasting Menu was delicious.\\n\\n1.

I enjoyed everything.', u\"Stumbled in here as we were passing by - and boy we were not disappointed. I believe we did the chef's tasting, and EVERY SINGLE thing was amazing!!!!! Just delicious. We legit cannot stop talking about how good the food was. The Chef's tasting was also very pricey. I would like to say we spend over $200. But worth every penny.\", u\"This was one of those meals that actually lived up to all the hype that surrounds it inside and outside of the yelp universe.  I'm not the biggest fan of American (New) cuisine, especially when it comes in smaller tapas serving sizes but WOW I was extremely impressed with the flavors and unique courses that seemed to never end.  The ambiance is fairly laid back but in a more refined, mature hipster way.  The seating can get tight but it's all about the experience and the service is on point.\\n\\nI can't remember half the dishes that we got served through out the chef's tasting but it was all so good. I did have an interesting cocktail with the dinner that had a smoky tequila mix (it sounds worse than it tasted) and I would definitely recommend for the adventurous type who like deep, smoky flavors.\\n\\nAll in all a very memorable dinner and I hope to come back again sometime in the future.\", u\"Awesome food with an unnoticeable, appeal. \\nWhatever Traif was before it became Traif- it's working. It just has this funked out vibe that I love. Hostess was accommodating considering, we had no reservations and seated immediately in their enclosed back patio. Awesome!\\n\\nTraif may not look like much from the outside but interior's warm with an energetic feel; slightly coming off as romantic, but can highly be a cool hang out spot. (British 80s pop, rocked, but was a tad loud to follow a conversation). Our server, Shanice (apologies for any misspellings) was quick and so friendly throughout the night. Traif's main premise are on their Tapas; where you can go for their Tasting Menu or simply, do a few, individual plates. \\n\\nOur Tapas we're lovely and so damn flavorful...with a price. The Crab On Polenta was freaking delicious, Mr. Man's, Pork Belly according to him, was cooked to perfection. My Japanese Pumpkin Tempura was airy and so tasty with Pomegranates as was my Sweet & Sour Shrimp. Cocktail variety was nice but my Zen Garden drink, lacked majorly in the intense factor. \\n\\nAlmost everything fell into place and their ventilation system was my biggest issue. Even stepping in Traif, the strong smell of food and smoke, filled the air and hit me quick and I just knew by the end of my meal and walking out of Traif, I'd be smelling like food- from top to bottom. With the exception of that big turn off, Traif is indeed a cool spot and wouldn't mind making the trip all the way from White Plains to Williamsburg, to enjoy their tasty Tapas.\", u\"Waiter was aloof, not sure if they were trying to portray a hipsterish vibe, but it was a bit offsetting and awkward? We were a party of five he had us at a table of four plus an add on chair on the side. When asked if we could be moved to a larger table, he immediately told us no and that this was the largest table. (Two tables down there was a empty table for six. Restaurant was empty except for the outdoorsy/back area) After we settled down, he said actually let's move. Hm knocked off a star for that.\\n\\nWe had a total of 11 tapas many of which had similar base sauce/relatively salty, and a play on heat vs fruit for the summer season. The bill ran up to be about $240 including tip. \\n\\nStrawberry cinnamon glazed Berkshire Baby back ribs were alright. They tasted like they were first boiled/pressure cooked over before quickly fried. Crisp on the outside and moist on inside. Although not a powerful flavor that I expect from baby back ribs. The sauce was strawberry cinnamon, which sounds better than what it actually tasted. There were a few strawberries strewn on top. We ordered two of these per recommendation of waiter and I think that was a mistake; one would've been enough since there are better dishes on the menu.\\n\\nBaked muenster cheese, smoked chorizo, golden apples, crostini. This dish was salty with the cheese and chorizo. The chorizo reminded me of bacon bits. IMO this dish wasn't worth it \\n\\nSeared dayboat  scallops, snap and English pea risotto, caper tomato brown butter had a nice seat and the risotto was a creamy balance to the saltiness of the scallops. This was a good dish.\\n\\nSeared foie gras, Yukon potatoes, bacon, Sunnyside, maple, hot sauce. This was a rich dish and the maple was a good touch. Potatoes really soaked up.the flavor well. \\n\\nWe had some filler dishes that I can't recall. \\n\\nBelow are the really memorable dishes:\\n\\nHampshire Pork Belly had nice kick with the banana peppers and subtle sweetness with the summer peach. Good combo.\\n\\nDuck with a butternut squash sauce with blueberry glaze, blue cheese on the side. This was souse vide for sure -- the color was even throughout and tender moist. Great sear and interesting sauce. Ended with the best dish of the night.\"], u'130.Brooklyn Commune': [u'I\\'ve been coming here for four years nonstop. The best restaurant in Brooklyn, hands down! Chris and Eugenie have really upped their game even more recently, with delicious new seasonal salads like roasted squash and the return of my perennial favorite Kale Caesar, the best salad on earth! I come here almost every day and start with a few mugs of heart-thumping Stumptown Coffee, which brings me back to my favorite American city, Portland, OR..Besides the salads, I love the vegan burger and Tempeh Lettuce and Tomato. For breakfast, the breakfast sandwich and the whole grain muesli are divine. (As you can tell, I\"m a hardcore vegetarian.) \\n\\nIt\\'s a very comfortable and friendly place to bring your laptop and work on weekdays. I do my best blog writing here. Chris and Eugenie are like family and their adorable small children sometimes join in the fun. All the baristas are kind and easy to talk to, from Jacob to Brad.\\n\\nThe neighborhood is buzzing with excitement about the start of a new brunch menu next door at Butterfunk Kitchen in a couple of weeks. Chris just gave me a sample of their homemade, inverted cheesecake and I\\'m on Cloud Nine. Dear God, please be sure I\\'m buried in his fresh fruit jam and homemade whipped cream.......\\n\\nIf you don\\'t live in the neighborhood, the Commune and Butterfunk are just inches from  the F line. If you\\'re coming from Manhattan or downtown Brooklyn be sure to exit at the rear of the train at the 15th Street/Prospect Park stop. The joint is hopping on weekends.\\n\\nCome say hello:) You won\\'t be disappointed. I promise!!!!', u\"I've been living by here for years and had never come in of my own accord. I don't really know why. I guess when I wake up or if I'm out and about on my own I don't automatically think of dining for breakfast or lunch at a healthy organic food type of place. Tons of healthy options and tons of vegan options. But honestly, the food here tastes great and I actually felt pretty good after eating. Though, that might have also been because of the open bar for wine, prosecco, and canned beer. I came here for a bridal shower this weekend. Which explains the above. Everything was top notch. It's a small space but if you have 20-30 people or less it makes a perfect spot for a celebration or small event. \\n\\nMeals that were served - Some kind of mixed summer salad with walnuts, plums, cherry tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese. It was actually really great for a salad. \\nCauliflower cooked with raisins, slivered almonds, and onions. It was sweet but overall pleasant and had great seasonings. Fried eggplant with pesto sauce and tomatoes. It didn't taste greasy in the slightest and the battered coating was crisp. That's actually something incredibly hard to achieve with cooking eggplant. Impressed. Lastly a citrus grilled fish. I have no idea what kind of fish it was. Perhaps tilapia or cod. It was white. I know that doesn't help. My fish knowledge is pretty horrible. There wasn't a menu list in front of us and I don't see some of their catered items on their regular menu. But everything was great! My favorite were the sweet potato fries that were thick cut and drizzled with an aioli sauce. So much yum. Really paired well with all of my basic betch rose and proseccos. Also, I didn't try their freshly baked goods here because I think the bridal shower peeps brought deserts from outside. . . . but they sell really great looking ones I believe they get from Balthazar Bakery.\", u\"Hands down, yes! It's rare that I can get my husband to brunch. He's like the brunch grinch and hates every place. Yet, when it comes to Brooklyn Commune, he's always game.\\n\\nI've tried numerous things here and can't say I've had anything bad. The vegan BLT is solid, the chicken sandwich is out of this world, the regular burger is pretty good and the salads are also fantastic. I don't have a favorite so I just tend to bounce around the menu every time I order. What can I say? I like life on the wild side.\\n\\nService is great. They're quick to refill coffee and waters. There's also outdoor seating so it's nice to bring the dog, people watch and chat with neighbors as they pass by.\\n\\nIf you're around this area and seeking brunch, you can't go wrong with Brooklyn Commune.\", u\"Everything here is delicious.  I definitely recommend the mac and cheese and the BLT.  Also can't go wrong with the cheesy grits.\", u\"Stopped in last week to have lunch with my son who just moved into the area.  Interesting interior design.  Kind of a weird ordering vibe.  You order at the counter, which is fine, but unclear.\\nOnce we figured out the protocol, he ordered a burger and I got a soba noodle salad with smoked tofu.  There was also cold water out for customers, very nice.\\nWe settled into a comfortable table and were alerted when the food was ready.  My son really liked his burger, it did look awesome.\\nMy cold soba noodle salad was a big disappointment.  There was very little seasoning or flavor on it at all and the smoked tofu was tiny shreds of compacted tofu which tasted like bits of rubber.  I might suggest they use a different brand/style of tofu as I firmly believe this could be a great dish!\\nOverall, just ok, wouldn't return unless I happened to be in the neighborhood for another reason.\", u\"I taught a class in the area and spotted butterfunk kitchen!  I dashed across the street only to see they open at 5:30pm and it was 12:30.   I sadly went into the adjacent establishment only to find that Brooklyn Commune is it's conjoined kitchen and staff are of the Buttterfunk variety!  Not seeing the exact items I drooled at online I settled for an iced coffee in a clean, spacious cafe with great iced coffee.  I will surely be back soon to get a taste of the fare.\", u\"BEST MAC & CHEESE IN BROOKLYN. Fight me.\\n\\nHaha, actually, don't. But do go here! Their BLT is also superb, annexed with guacamole and tomato relish for an extra kick. I am equal opportunity about my bacon but these slabs, it must be said, are extremely thick and fancy tasting. If you want to completely ruin your dietary plans for the day, the cheese grits with fried eggs and jerk pork will hit you, baby, one more time.\\n\\nI like that the atmosphere has an ebb and a flow; I like that you can meet up with a friend, or jam on your laptop, and not feel alienated in either social situation. Great spot for a working lunch. The table service is really good and the iced coffee is scarily strong. It's a pretty nice escape from the kid-centric atmosphere of other bistros and caf\\xe9s in Park Slope.\", u\"Yelp usually has my back, but I honestly feel a little betrayed on this one! I was running to the train and needed some coffee, and I saw that this was well reviewed, and someone mentioned Stumptown. No one mentioned that they just have a big jug of pre-mass-brewed coffee that they'll serve you for the ridiculous price of $2.75. Whatttttt?!?!?!?!?! I don't like drip coffee, I wanted a latte or flat white or something. But I was pressed for time so I grabbed a couple of coffees (did not see the $2.75 price, but I might have just been floored by their not making fresh coffee or anything other than drip, and I may not have looked for the price). they were unexceptional. This looks like a coffee place. It is not a coffee place. Maybe the brunch is fine, and the pastries looked decent, which is why I'm giving it three stars--I don't want to drag down the rating based on one item. Even if that one item is coffee. At what, to all appearances, is a coffee shop. But I won't be back, at least not for the coffee.\", u\"I stopped by here for a late lunch today and appreciated hat even though it has a super limited menu, it still has vegan options for both breakfast and lunch. It seems they're connected with a restaurant called Butterfunk Kitchen which is more of a dinner spot and also has a vegan option.\\n\\nAnyway, I ordered the vegan blt. It wasn't bad. The bread was really good and the produce was fresh and flavorful. I like that the tempeh had been marinated, unlike how most non-vegan restaurants serve tempeh. Overall it slightly better than mediocre and was lacking in salt and moisture. Probably won't go out of my way to eat here, but wouldn't mind doing so if I'm in the neighborhood.\", u'Sunday before Memorial Day at 9:20am.  Plenty of seating available.  Quickly greeted and provided coffee.  Drip coffee only, no espresso available,  but    both leaded and unleaded coffees were enjoyable.  The turkey hash was well seasoned and poached eggs were nicely done.  The homemade granola with Greek yogurt was very good with notes of cinnamon.   Service was excellent.  The entire place was full within 15 minutes of our arrival.', u'I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. \\n\\nSo my friend and I came here for Friday brunch. We walked in and were immediately confused about the process. \\nThere are a bunch of tables scattered through the restaurant with a sort of rustic, hip, messy feel. We figured it\\'s not waiter service and walked over to the counter to order. They have this blackboard behind the counter with the present menu and my friend ordered the \"BLT\" -- (None vegan) There was no mention of it being vegan on the board. \\n\\nWhat he received was a vegan BLT with tempeh bacon. He ate it, it was good. But not what he had ordered. \\nI ordered the Tofu scramble. It wasn\\'t mind blowing. It wasn\\'t even amazing. Pretty mediocre. The coffees were absolute crap -- not sure where they get the beans from but we definitely were not able to drink it. \\n\\nSo my point is as follows --- if you\\'re going to be vegan friendly, you might want to write on the board what\\'s vegan and what\\'s not. Ordering a BLT and receiving tempeh is deceiving and unappreciated.', u'I used to go to Brooklyn Commune fairly often, but my last experience there was so terrible that I probably won\\'t be back. The people who work there have always had a bit of an attitude problem, but it was at the point of blatant disrespect this time.\\n\\nI went there on a weekend, and I arrived over an hour before their closing time of 5PM. On the weekends, they have waiter service, and our waitress was rude from the start. She asked us if we wanted drinks, and as I looked at the drinks on the menu, she snapped at me, \"Um, we aren\\'t serving breakfast anymore. Lunch is on the other side of that menu.\" Okay... but I was looking at the drinks, which are on the same side as the breakfast. It was kind of insulting.\\n\\nThey ended up not having the menu item I wanted, which would be fine if that was the only thing that went wrong. But the waitress wasn\\'t even friendly or apologetic about it. I\\'ve almost never had a waitress who was in as bad of a mood as this one. It just made for a very unpleasant experience.\\n\\nHonestly, it might as well have not been waiter service! Not once did our waitress refill my empty water glass. She didn\\'t even come by our table to check on things ever. She brought out all of our food at once, even though we had asked for something to start. And it\\'s not like it was super busy or anything. Like I said, it was around 4PM, so that\\'s a pretty off hour. \\n\\nAround 4:30ish, the other person working there wanted to go outside to start bringing tables and chairs in, but another couple was still sitting outside. Our waitress looked outside with a seriously pissed off look and said, in full volume, \"Ugh, those people are STILL here. Ughhhhh!\" Um... Brooklyn Commune doesn\\'t close till 5PM. It seriously turned me off from ever coming back. \\n\\nAt around 4:40, while my boyfriend and I were still eating, they dropped our check on our table without so much as a smile. I understand that they want to get home, but that\\'s no excuse to be so blatantly disrespectful to customers. There is no excuse for the way I was treated here.', u\"I'll go out of my way to eat here.\\n\\nThis place is good for a quick quality bite meal.  It's a quiet and relaxed atmosphere, more of a cafe than a restaurant.  The menu is simple and easy and from what I can tell, everything on there is a perfect version of what it is.  The chef does a very good job to have a complete menu that includes local ingredients and tailors to all diets.  \\n\\nI had what might be the best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had here.  It was Korean style pulled pork and had fresh basil leaves.  I also tried the burger and part of a grilled cheese.  Everything was excellent and couldn't find anything to criticize.\\n\\nI'll be sure to go back.\", u\"I'm almost embarrassed about the fact that it took me so long to write this review. Especially since I'm the duchess and most awesome person who comes here for brunch regularly. \\n\\nSince I moved to the border of Windsor Terrace and Kensington, I started looking for a place that could fulfill my gluten free brunchy carboholic needs....looks like I found it!\\n\\nWhatever you get on the menu that includes bread can be substituted for the gf kind. I'm fairly sure that this place uses store bought, but their brunch is so scrumptious that I don't even care. \\n\\nThe BLT is a bacon lovers dream and the fried egg and grits is a cheesy bowl of beauty. Sadly, my favorite dish, The Lyonnaise just got cut from their menu since they renovated the place a few weeks ago. \\n\\nThey also have a freshly made gluten free scone. Every time I've been there, it's been apple & cheese so I'm not sure if they have any other choices. Either way, get it. It's tasty. My lady thinks I'm a weirdo since I like to dunk it in my milky chamomile/jasmine tea, but I don't care. Do it.\", u'Brooklyn Commune has had a changing menu over the years, of which I\\'ve tried a number of those items, but holy crap did they kill it with the burger!! A relatively new item on the menu, my mum and I decided to split one today since we both knew we couldn\\'t each finish a whole one. Damn did they knock this out of the park!\\n\\nThe burger we got was absolutely delicious, made to order, and the ingredients used were equally as yummy! The burger was seasoned nicely and cooked perfectly. The avocado, chipotle ketchup, mustard sauce, and greens that came along with it were the perfect addition and tasted insanely fresh. The choice of bread was perfect, a brioche bun, rather than a regular sesame-seed bun, and added to the overall flavors. \\n\\nMy mum and I have also had their BLT and while it is very good, our only dislike of the sandwich is that we\\'re not too fond of the thick cut of bacon used for it. I mean, bacon is bacon, and you can\\'t hate on that, but we simply prefer the thinner slices that get really crispy when you cook them. That\\'s really our only \"problem\" with it. Everything else is just fine.\\n\\nOverall, we both like Brooklyn Commune, and it definitely comes in handy considering we live right across the street. Hoping they decide to make the burger a permanent item on the menu, since there\\'s really no good burger joints in the neighborhood and the one we had today was stellar.', u\"Wish they were open for dinner! Love the coffee, muffins, and breakfast options everything I've had here so far has been great. Perfect spot in the neighborhood and right beside the subway\", u'We waited a long time to visit. We should have waited longer.  Although half empty it still took forty minutes for two orders of scrambled eggs. My wife likes her bacon well done, which she got.  I like mine cooked , which I did not: it arrived tepid and oily.  Perhaps they were trying to save money: one pat of butter for four pieces of toast, which had been waved near a toaster some time earlier.  I like a little pepper on my eggs, about a fifth the amount the cook decided to use.\\nWe should have waited longer.', u\"I don't get this place - they are usually pretty empty in the mornings, but they always take forever to prepare food.\\n\\nThis morning we popped in for a quick pre-work bite. We ordered a sandwich and grits. 30 minutes later, still no food....even though the place was totally empty when we talked in.\\n\\nI wish this was a one-time occurrence, but sadly it is consistent with our previous visits this year.\\n\\nWhat's worse, the food is inconsistent. Often the grits are delicious! Other times, nearly inedibly bland.\\n\\nOne time we ordered some kind of turkey dish that was literally a lump of dry turkey covered in salt and spices. We we're like wtf???!?\\n\\nAnyway, not worth your time!\", u\"I'll give this place another try, but the first impression wasn't great. It was a Sunday afternoon and even though it wasn't crowded it took a while for our waitstaff to tend to us. When she finally did and put a cup of coffee down on the table she had blood on her hand where she'd scraped or cut herself. Many of the empty tables were not promptly cleared and/or wiped down after patrons left.\", u\"I'm here to drink some iced coffee and enjoy quality laptop me time on a sunday.\\n\\nPros: good light, good coffee, fried chicken sandwich i made lots of eye contact with, train station is two steps from the door\\nCons: passive aggressive laptop signs make me feel unwelcome (NO LAPTOP AT THIS TABLE, NO LAPTOPS ON WEEKENDS). that said it's empty and so they aren't bothering me to get out and make room for other people. also - no air conditioning on a hot summer day.\"], u'60.Brooklyn Beet Company': [u\"i'm actually still sitting in this restaurant eating while i write this review. i just have to say - wow. i would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone. the waiter is super friendly, it's small inside but they have an outdoor area for bigger parties, they make their own beets sauce( delish), the food is very delicious. \\n\\n-zweigelt braised short ribs- delicious & well cooked. \\n-tokaj steamed P.E.i mussels- my favorite! \\n-the new crop(salad)- fresh & yummy. \\n-aged alpine asiago- it was ok for me. \\n-sausage planner- yummy \\n-beef gulash- really delicious \\n-chef korzo burger- also delicious\", u\"Have been here for dinner and brunch and enjoyed both times. The signature korzo burger is available all day and is delicious! Definitely a must try. Love their beet ketchup and their hot sauce. Also tried a bunch of dishes for brunch and, everything was good.. The freedom burger (with blueberry pancake buns) is good for the Instagram pics but I would definitely choose the Korzo for the crunchy, chewy deep-fried bun and juicy patty.\\nDrinks are great! Brunch mimosas are nice and strong.\\nService is great as well. Very good option if you're in the Bay Ridge area.\", u'I ate here last night and ordered the chef burger.\\n\\nIT WAS DELICIOUS.', u\"Had brunch here and their sandwiches are super tasty! My boyfriend ordered it but I took a few bites :) the bun part actually looks like the outside of a donut and wasn't too thick. I ordered the sausage hash and I would actually wouldn't want to order that again. there was way too many sausages and it was just okay. Their beet ketchup made it more tasty.\", u\"Excellent. Just superb. In food and service. Came here with my boyfriends family and we all shared the following:\\n\\nSquash dumplings filled with mushrooms - good, very creamy. I enjoyed this but was a little heavier in flavor than I'd like.  Recommended for cheese lovers.  \\n\\nWunderwurst sausage platter - great starter. I love the sear on the sausages. Did not like the horseradish but wasn't a big deal. \\n\\nDuck Confit - cooked to perfection served with a side of mango salsa. Very tender and soft. Not overly gamey.  \\n\\nGoulash - everyone's favorite other than the Korzo Burger\\n\\nKorzo Burger - The best. You should get this if it's your  first visit.\\n\\nAfter our meal, my boyfriend left his phone like the dinglehead he sometimes is but the awesome waitress ran to make sure we got it before we left. Most places would just leave it with security but she literally ran the intersection to McDonalds to return it.\", u'One of the best places to eat in bay ridge. It is only open for dinner which is a shame but you will not be disappointed. We sat in the outside back area at a shared table. Looks like most of the tables are shared since they do not have much space. This is ok considering it is brooklyn and space is at a premium. \\n\\nStarted off with the edam slovak which was a fried cheese appetizer with a home made mustard. Very delicious with the right mix of crunchy and creamy in the cheese.\\n\\nI had to try the original korzo burger and it did not disappoint. Im not even sure what were the toppings on the burger but everything worked together well. If i had one negative it would be that it was a bit oily. Overall it was great.\\n\\nMy wife got the pulled pork sandwich. It was not your typical pulled pork sandwich from bbq place. It had its own twist and flavors like most of the items here.\\n\\nThey also had a homemade spicy ketchup that waa awesome. It complimented the burger very well.\\n\\nWe tried the beet-tini for a drink and it was spot on with the meal. \\n\\nThere is a serious argument between a 4 and 5. And i went with 5 bc everything was homemade and tasted like it was. Well done Beet Company!', u\"Every time I'm here the food is always delicious and fresh! Service is always great! The menu is super unique and the selection is hard to find anywhere else.\", u'So I\\'ve heard good things about this place where \"Beets\" are the star and worked into many dishes. \\nAside from the beet ketchup and hot sauce (which was really good btw), we opted to try other popular items. \\n\\nWe shared the Halusky and the Original burger with a cocktail and their signature beer. \\n\\nHalusky was heavy. Sausage, pork belly that tasted more like thick cut Canadian ham drowned in Gouda, saut\\xe9ed onions and nougatine dumplings. It was small in size but boy did it pack a punch. I would\\'ve liked some pita or crostini to accompany this as it were a bit salty for my sensitive palate, but at that rate, the appetizer would\\'ve sufficiently fed 2 people. \\n\\nThe Original burger, medium rare, was dressed with pickled relish and applewood bacon and encased in fried dough, not unlike a doughnut. Someone described it like a burger pie. I would say a burger knish or a burger patty. That is their unique spin on reinventing the burger. And BBC deserves praise. Fun, easy to hold and eat. The burger meat was juicy and delicious. I do miss my regular buns though. Maybe 2nd time\\'s the charm. Oh, and their skinny square fries deserve an honorable mention. So good and crispy, we finish every last one with the hot sauce that tasted like tangy salsa with a kick. You can purchase by the bottle. \\n\\nA quaint place for a relaxing late lunch.', u'Wonderful drinks, food and service ...\\nStarted w Stuffed Dates - wonderful \\nThen the pulled pork stuffed dumplings - my fav \\nThe Beet Salad - full of lots of good things \\nThen duck confit .. 2 legs w a berry sauce, mango salsa and smashed potatoes ... fantastic \\n\\nThe service was really the best!  She made wonderful suggestions, pleasant from start to finish', u'I finally got to try the famous Korzo Burger and was not disappointed. I got to try both versions on the burger (fried or grilled) and I prefer the fried one better. It was lightly fried and inside was super juicy and flavorful. I would definitely come back again.', u\"Wow, I've been to Brooklyn Beet Company (BBC) more than a few times, yet this was the first time I tried their burger and it was AMAZING! I could finish this review with: burger was amazing, staff is awesome, you should totally go! However, I will add a bit more color for you.\\n\\nFood wise, I had the Original Burger, medium rare while my girlfriend had Beet Benedikt. The burger was excellent: well seasoned, perfectly cooked and wrapped in a fried dough bun. Along with the string french fries and homemade cole slaw, its a pretty fantastic dish. Seriously, I am running out of adjectives to describe how much I enjoyed it. The Beet Benedikt, overall was a great dish. The combination of poached egg, hollandaise sauce, ham and cornmeal pancake makes an excellent flavor. These should be eaten together, however, because alone, they are not quite as delicious as the sum of there parts. The beets and lettuce are a nice complement, but not necessary to the whole dish. The menu has a number of other dishes I would like to try, so I will be back.\\n\\nShould you go? Absolutely, the food is great, the cocktails are creative and tasty and the staff is super friendly. You can tell a lot of care goes into everything at BBC and you will not be disappointed when you go.\", u'An amazing experience with such a unique selection of food. Service was great, prompt and with a smile. I got the Brooklyn beet \"burger\", an incredible beet and bean patty wrapped in a pastry with cheese and quickly fried served with fries with a beet catch-up and the Brooklyn beet-tini... Just can\\'t say enough amazing things about this place from food options to atmosphere. Plenty of vegetarian and non vegetarian options. My husband was equally pleased with his choice.', u'Tiny place, but very cozy. The owner was also our server and was very nice. \\n\\nThere is an interesting selection on the menu, overall everyone was pretty happy with what they ordered. I was told by everyone to try the deep fried burger and was not impressed. 4 star review comes from almost everyone in our group not feeling well after eating.', u\"Their korzo burger is undoubtedly the BEST burger I have had in my entire life, hands down. Even though I haven't been back for food in nearly two years, I still rave about Brooklyn Beet to this day. Essentially a burger donut, it consists of a thick, juicy and well seasoned patty, wrapped with a soft, fluffy and delicious dough, which are both cooked to perfection. Although it definitely doesn't compensate for how heavy the burger is, the meal is accompanied by a small side salad with a lightly acidic dressing to help break up the richness of the burger. In addition, Brooklyn Beet makes its own beet based ketchup, which is a perfect companion to your korzo. \\n\\nIf you're from Manhattan, this Brooklyn based restaurant is surely a trek, but the food, and sometimes the wait for a table, is 10/10 worth the journey. Overall, ambiance is good for a place to catch up with a friend. YOU HAVE TO COME HERE\", u'Here I go again ranting about restaurants who don\\'t believe in their servers writing shit down. \\n\\nTime to set the scene. It\\'s Wednesday around 6:30pm on the last day of summer. We\\'re a group of 5 and the restaurant is about half full or half empty depending on how well your Zoloft is working today. \\n\\nWhen we arrived, we noticed that there was 1 server and 1 bartender who both seemed in good spirits. We were seated in the backyard and asked about drinks right away. Now watch out. This review is about to take a drastic turn. \\n\\nAfter we ordered drinks, we waited. Then we waited some more and after a little more waiting, our drinks came. When the waitress came back, we were way past ready to order. We ordered appetizers and main meals at the same time and yup...this woman did not write one thing down. 3 appetizers and 5 meals with a ton of substitutions and questions in the middle...not one word written. And then we waited again and waited some more. \\n\\nThe main meal surprisingly came about 15 min after the appetizers and thankfully the food was good and hot. 3 out of 5 of us had been here before so we knew the food was worth it. \\n\\nAfter 4 of us we\\'re served, we waited for the last person in our party to get their meal. After about 5 minutes, she insisted that we start without her. 20 minutes later, after everyone was on their last few bites and the waitress was nowhere to be found, we were still waiting on the last entree. At this point we were all pissed and one of us got up to find the waitress. She was happily standing around by the opening of the kitchen EATING A PLATE OF FOOD. Ummmm seriously?\\n\\nSo we angrily told her that we still hadn\\'t  received all of our food. After an unapologetic & annoyed \"sorry\" SHE GOT MAD AT US!!! She asked what was missing (you would have known if you had written it down) and repeated about 10 times...\"What!! I SAID I was sorrrry.\" Ugh. \\n\\nSo after all of the meals were sent and eaten, I told the waitress that we were celebrating a birthday and to please bring us  a dessert. Though the dessert was on the house, nothing else was. Maybe if that last meal was on the house I wouldn\\'t have complained as much, but the waitress seriously screwed up. \\n\\nI will be coming here again for the food, but I will be very cautious if I see that woman again.', u\"Second time coming here for dinner and the food didn't disappoint.  It's so cozy inside and the staff is super nice and friendly. We ordered the dates wrapped in bacon which are the best I've tried! The beet salad, wunderwurst sampler which were delicious! My friend ordered the skirt steak which was huge!! I had the salmon dish and honestly the piece was tiny; maybe it was a bad piece of the cut I don't know, but it tasted good and wasn't dry. The pulled pork sandwich was huge, the meat was so tender it melted in your mouth, sooo good! The burgers here are amazing!! Definitely one of the best burgers in ny!!  \\nWill definitely be back for one!\", u\"Returned for a dinner and we were and continue to be so happy Pavel had our table. He is an outstanding waiter, keeping our water carafe full, bread available for mussels, checked up on us, and last but not least, accommodated a request for a cheesecake flan. \\nEveryone was thoroughly happy with the large order of mussels. Savory and plenty of soup to enjoy plus a side of delectable fries and hot bread. \\nThe leg of lamb dish is so hefty in portion and a delight. The fish and chips are a fail proof option. Korzo burgers are consistently tasty and plentiful in size. Heads up, the Hungarian peppers are hot! There's a trout fish that's super healthy and light, albeit the fish is lightly fried but not heavy at all. \\nOf course, cheesecake flan to finalize a superb night of food. Pavel helped us get a whole cake plus a birthday candle, and provided us the toppings of whip cream with caramel and the blueberries with strawberries. Very fun to decorate each slice ourselves. Many thanks Pavel! \\nService is always outstanding and the food quality complements it. BBC is a go to staple in the neighborhood.\", u'Had this place bookmarked for a while and decided to try it out. Happy to say that I will absolutely be coming back. They have a great menu - lots of options. Although a lot of the foods are on the heavier side, everything my bf and I tried was delicious. \\n\\nFOOD: They are NOT lying when they say that the Korzo burger is one of THE BEST burgers in NYC. The meat is incredibly juicy! Most interestingly, it is served almost as a pierogie. The dough around it is very soft and light. It compliments the meat and makes the juiciness of the meat the main focus. \\nMy bf and I both got \"The Original\" which comes with their beef blend, apple-smoked bacon, Allaguer cheese, house made mustard and a pickle. This all fits within the \"pierogi\". It comes with a choice of fries or salad. They suggest that you order the meat medium rare - which after trying, I highly suggest as well. \\nTheres not a doubt in mind I would want to come here instead of my usual burger spots when the craving hits! \\n\\nWe also got a few appetizers - The \"Turnip Fall Squash Dumplings\" with spicy pulled pork. They reminded me of the Russian \"vareniki\" - which is a dumpling, flat but filled. The pork here was tender and although there were only four served, they\\'re filling. If you like dumplings, definitely get these to try! They\\'re an unusual flavor from the dumplings at Asian places. There is an option to get the dumplings with mushrooms instead of the spicy pork. \\n\\nWe also got the \"Battered Slovak Edam\" which is fried cheese. It basically reminded me of a very high end mozzarella stick. It comes with tartar sauce which is a very interesting touch to the cheese. It\\'s a fairly large square - definitely a \"comfort food\". Both appetizers came with some beets on the side . \\n\\nThe service was quick and our waitress was super friendly. The place itself is very small. There are a few high tables and then cafe style shared tables on the side.\\n\\nDefinitely give this place a try!', u'The food was absolutely delicious! They have organic beer, a delicious beet ketchup and a hot sauce. We started off with beers and pickled vegetables, which were good. Then we had the farmer dish and the German dish. Both had 2 eggs. I can say this food gave me a food-gasum. I will definitely return to try the other entrees on the menu. I highly recommend this place!', u\"One of my favorite brunch spots in Brooklyn. The food is always solid everytime I visit and the service is great. I love how they're not super well known since that means I never have to wait when I come here for brunch. \\n\\nMy favorites here are the korzo burger, which is a delicious beef patty slightly precooked and then wrapped in a dough that reminds me of donut. Then it is fried and served with a salad. This is my all time favorite burger! It is my idea of a hamburger and donut hybrid! I also love coming here for their brunch flatbread that has various fruits and Nutella on it. \\n\\nPlease try this place out, you won't regret it!\"], u'1.Honey Badger': [u'Exquisite food and very nice servers.\\n\\nDefinitely small portions, but everything is delicious!\\n\\nAlso great music!', u'Good food\\nnice presentation\\ncool soundtrack\\nIdk if the neighborhood is ready for an $18 salad (including tip)\\ncash only', u\"Honest Review: If you're looking for something to post on insta or snap chat, this is the place, but if you want good food for a price you would consider decent, don't go here. Everything at this place is intriguing, such as the squid ink pasta, ostrich, or the Szechuan flower that comes with a piece of sushi. Yet saying that, nothing here was good. Everything was bland and there were either too many or too little flavors. The one chef (which is also the only waiter), will take 30 minutes to prepare one simple dish. This isn't because it takes long to prepare, but he tries to make it very artsy, something that should be considered second after taste. I feel bad for the chef because he truly is a nice guy and he really brings a nice atmosphere to the place, but the food actually sucks and I hope he can change the menu (which he does weekly) to something more flavorful and rustic rather than artsy and bland or over the top. IMO I wouldn't go here unless you're willing to pay $100 for 4 small dishes that I would rate 4/10.\", u\"I'm not gifted enough with words to describe the magic of what happens with food here, the feel of the space, or the genuine hospitality. \\n\\nIt's like two of your best foodie friends are experimenting and letting you in on their culinary adventures. The chef's/owners put a lot of thought, and love into each dish, and will explain to you the unique properties of each unheard of ingredient not with pretentiousness, but with giddy reverence for what they bring to the table. \\n\\nIf I listed dishes here I think I wouldn't do justice as I've forgotten half of the ingredients due to my crap memory, so you should just check out a photo of the menu, which changes.  4 out of 5 dishes were phenomenal regardless of if sea-centric, land-centric, or veggie-centric, and 1 out of 5 appreciated anyways for the notes or theme it was exploring (maybe a dash less lava salt on the scallops kind of thing as an example of only critique), and I expect to go back and find something new to check out so whatevs. \\n\\nThey are also looking to do even more -- adding on the space next door to grown some of their own produce on the rooftop, make bread, etc. \\n\\nMy wife and I are foodies and are pretty weary of unwarranted praise for local BK spots not approaching quality of counterparts in bigger food havens in the city. This place is worthy is a destination worthy of travel by those outside the neighborhood. I just hope I'll still be able to eat here easily next year...\", u'Chef knows what he is doing. I wish there are some carb dishes on the menu, would be nice. Every dish has great seasonnings. Be openminded to eat at this place, expect the unexpected.', u\"Beautiful space and wonderful owners/chef/servers. It's clear that they put a lot of though, love and effort into their food. And it definitely has a farm to table feel. Yes, it's expensive, but they made it clear that they use extremely high quality ingredients. However, I wasn't really that impressed with the flavor of the food. I don't know if it was something as simple as needing more salt but with many of the dishes it felt like it was lacking. I really wanted to love this place and will probably give it another try but I walked away feeling a bit disappointed.\", u'Creative dishes and unusual ingredients..still thinking about their salad... Also, very kind couple and nice atmosphere.', u\"A great restaurant. It's unusual to have every thing everyone orders be a hit with really great service. The portions are not overwhelming but we left full and happy.\", u\"This place is a gem! Came here for dinner on a week night and had an amazing evening, a really cosy atmosphere where you feel like you are eating at your very talented friends house. Some things to know: it's byob, the portions are small but delicious and you can book by calling or DMing the owner on instagram. I think there menu changes a lot so I'm looking forward to going back. Highlight of our meal was the ostrich tartare! Overall really interesting food, cooked right and a real work of art.\", u'I hate to be the party pooper here, but I think it\\'s important to know what to expect.\\n\\nThe prices have increased significantly since the menus posted in the photos- around a 40% increase already and they just recently opened. The portions are laughably tiny, which with the price combination makes it very expensive. Expect to pay about $60-80 per person (without drinks!). Very unreasonable for the neighborhood. \\n\\nThe ceviche was delicious. I wish the portion was larger. Other items were just ok. \\n\\nI wish they would bring back the \"old\" prices. It would still be pricey, but more worth it for the inventive dishes and family run business.', u\"Extraordinary food. Fresh, interesting, imaginative. The dish of foraged greens and various vegetables was nothing short of spectacular. Can't wait to introduce my friends to it - it's  great to have such a place in the neighborhood, we're happening! The owners who cook and serve are really lovely which doesn't hurt.\", u'This place is a gem. Amazing food, wonderful service, and reasonable prices for the quality and love they put into their food...\\n\\nWelcome to the neighborhood, neighbor.', u\"Loved the music, food and general vibe of the restaurant. I'm vegan and they accommodated my bf and I generously with local ingredients and a mouth full of flavors. I can't wait to go back!\", u'Fabulous and special if you are looking for something unique.  Limited,  but thoughtfully curated menu with local farmers market fare.  Loved it! Just a treat.', u\"It's an experience. The cuisine is difficult to describe. The food is exquisite. This place is for those who can appreciate the richness in the food more than quantity of food. The balance of crispy, tangy, sweet, creamy and crunchy all into one. Savor every nibble. The ambiance is relaxed and great for neighborly conversations. The chefs/owner deliver the masterpieces to your table.\", u\"One of the best meals I've had in NYC. I actually made a yelp just to review this place because it is so dang good. The food was better than some Michelin star restaurants I've been too. The portions are small, but the dishes are so creative and flavorful. Incredible dining experience- catch this place while it is still a hidden gem in the neighborhood because it won't be for long\", u'Wonderful dining experience that was personalized and intimate. However, we ended up going to eat another meal after this because we were so hungry (ordered one appetizer and two entrees for two people). Delicious but be forewarned about very small potions.', u'Just had brunch here.  A quirky and beautiful place. Lovely interior design -- the walls made me feel like I was in a silver birch tree forest. Real food celebration going on here. Spirit is warm and embracing -- lots of love. They are, shall I say, \"relaxed\" in pace. Come prepared to spend some time. No web site, no sign, they take reservations through Instagram although we were the only ones there for brunch. Portions are small, so order a few things if you are hungry.', u\"We have  been 3-4 times now and have been blown away every time. The atmosphere is warm and the food is artistically delicious. Also it's nice to get a bottle of wine from next door and enjoy there.  The menu changes often so I'm tempted to go every week. My kids love their daughter and they are patient with my kids. I can't wait to see what they do with the space next door as they grow and expand. Glad to support restaurants who choose local and organic foods as well!  Glad we live close! See you guys soon!\", u\"Delicious and unusual. Unique. There is nothing like this in the entire neighborhood. Special occasion restaurant. I still don't know what a crone or a gooseberry is but they were delicious. Terrific bread. Charcoal dessert.\"], u'144.Boutros': [u'Ok BACKSTORY. . . so my friend Isabella somehow found out about an app called Seated (originally called VOCO LIFE) which pays you $15 in Amazon or Itunes to make reservations through their app. We skeptically made a reservation at Pair Wine and Cheese which has since closed LOL. Anyways, we get to Pair Wine and Cheese and they did not have our reservation on file and the chef had left! \\n\\nThrown to the street, we didn\\'t know what to do. Walking around Brooklyn Heights with a hungry belly is not fun, let me tell you. Suddenly, across Atlantic Avenue we see \"Boutros\", beautiful soft lighting shining out, visible greenery etc. We run across the street only to find what looks like a bar and a closed dining room after all it was 9:30 pm on a Wednesday. We ask the bartender if the kitchen is open still and he says \"Sure!\" and seats us at the table closest to the bar so we feel included. \\n\\nWe order cocktails and I am ECSTATIC when I see Isabella\\'s drink has a perfect spherical ice cube. Spheres have the lowest volume to surface ratio which means the ice melts much slower than a cube, which has more surface (sides) than a sphere of the same volume. \\n\\nand then. . .the food. OMG I don\\'t even know what to say except it was divine. We had a salad of rocket and peas DRENCHED with the most fragrant olive oil, sooooo good I wanted to lick the plate. The salad was served with hummus and hold up- green almonds. What\\'s a green almond? Green almonds have the briefest whisper of a season in the spring before their shells harden and start looking (and tasting!) more like the almonds we know and love. They are tart and crisp and subversively addictive around cocktail hour. If you see them, promise me that you\\'ll give this uber-seasonal delicacy a try. Then I had octopus which was nothing short of stunning. I can\\'t remember what Isabella got for her entree but I\\'m sure it was as good as mine. I can\\'t wait to go back here.', u\"This has been the best dining experience I have had anywhere in a long long time. They even make it look easy, and it's refreshing to see a new spot flourish like this in BK. \\n\\nFrom start to finish, service was at its best- friendly, timely and they just were being excellent at their jobs. Food was unbeleiveabley good. The nice complimenary bread starts you off to a good start, and then all the dishes thereafter 5stars. Probably the best pork chop I have had in all time. Hats off guys. \\n\\nWe also sat at the Chef's table which was an amazing experience- the team in their works so well and dont stress its amazing to see. Spotless as well. Cudos Butros!\", u\"One thing I'll never complain about is the explosion of new trendy and upscale restaurants opening up in the neighborhood. I'd been following Boutros' Instagram for a while (since before they opened) and finally made my way there for dinner.\\n\\nThe space is as gorgeous as advertised. It wasn't a restaurant before, which is even more impressive. The bartender told us it was actually an ice cream shop decades ago, and they kept the floor tiling. There are cool lightbulbs hanging from strings, and tons of awesome cooking/cocktail books lining the shelves. There's also a big mossy thing on the wall behind the bar and in the bathroom.\\n\\nAnyway, the entrees range from $18 to $31, but I recommend doing a bunch of starters to share and a pizza if you're just 2-3 people.\\n\\nWe did the foie gras fritters, grilled octopus, smoked halloumi, and the clam pizza.\\n\\nYou'd think deep frying foie gras wouldn't work, but it does. I especially loved the strawberry sauce that it was set on top of.\\n\\nThe octopus was cooked perfectly - tender and not at all rubbery. Could've gone for a little more char though. The red pepper chutney was a great complement.\\n\\nThe grilled halloumi was basically a sizable arugula salad with watermelon. The halloumi was hidden underneath and the whole dish was a nice contrast of flavors.\\n\\nThe clam pizza was pretty damn good as well. The crust was airy, and the clams were plentiful. It's not quite a New Haven crust, but it's probably one of the better clam pizzas in the area (which is no small feat since there are a TON of pizzerias nearby).\\n\\nTheir beer selection was respectable, and they have a hell of a wine list. Service was great, and I'm looking forward to coming back for brunch!\", u\"It's fitting that Chef Allen Dabagh opened his first restaurant on this stretch of Atlantic. The Middle Eastern flavors from his heritage blended with New American cookery is a perfect representation of the amazing (if bougie) neighborhoods of Cobble Hill and Brooklyn Heights, bisected by a street that gives us Sahadi's, Damascus Bakery and more.\\n\\nThe space itself is beautiful. From the living wall behind the bar, to the chef's counter where you can watch the efficient expediting of everything you're about to eat, there isn't a bad seat in the house. \\n\\nThe menu is divided into appetizers, vegetables, pizzas, and mains. I've yet to try the pizza (although the crust looked superb as one walked by, and the za'atar sprinkled bread they bake fresh for each table speaks to the quality of that 760 degree oven), but every other section sports at least a few winners. \\n\\nAmong the starters, the fluke crudo had heat and balance, in addition to being easy on the eyes. The foie gras fritters are foie gras fritters (can't be bad), and although I would've liked a bit more of the soujouk (think Middle Eastern chorizo), the bulgur fried rice was tasty as well. That last dish seems out of place as a starter; it's a large portion and it doesn't feel like an appetizer. With more soujouk added and a fried egg on top (as opposed to scrambled and mixed in as it is) it would make it a perfect dish to start your day (I believe it's on the menu of their recently launched brunch, so there's that). In fact, since we ordered too much, I took it home and did just that, and it was phenomenal. \\n\\nThe mains are well-cooked, well-balanced, and tied together by incredible sauce work. The brown sauce with the beef is something I could just drink as my meal, and the caramel that comes with the pork chop ties the entire dish together. I appreciate the way the flavors are layered as well; the perfectly tender beef arrives with both charred stalks of broccoli, and also a broccoli puree. The effect is stunning, and it's my favorite dish thus far. \\n\\nSimilarly (and shockingly), the peas were the most memorable aspect of our most recent meal. With charred whole peas, pea pods, and a puree on the sides, it all came together with the green almonds added in a final flourish, and it made me so happy that it (1) tasted amazing and (2) shows that vegetables aren't an afterthought at all. \\n\\nAll in all, an excellent addition to the neighborhood, and I plan to keep coming back.\", u'Our meal here was exceptional. There was no fail. We had the leben crostini, bulgar fried rice, smoked haloumi with arugula, spring peas, angel hair pasta, and the duck. All the dishes were perfectly executed. The flavors are multidimensional and complimentary. This was a truly superb dining experience and we will be back for more. AND the beignets OMG delicious!!', u'So far so good. Great service,  decor, music, and you gotta try these two drinks: the Almond and the Ancho Chile. We will try the pizza one day soon. Come visit all you crazy #tourists!', u\"Food was delicious, but service was even better. Quan was our host and he was absolutely incredible, accommodating and just really friendly. It's nice to go to a restaurant that has it all. I was pleased with the service and the food. Definitely going back!\", u\"This restaurant has been on our radar ever since it opened a few months back. Finally having the time stop in for dinner we were instantly blown away at how stunning the dining room is. Aesthetically, Boutros oozes charm and character. As soon as you walk in your eyes go right to the bar, which is tucked under Edison lights, surrounded by living greens, and finished off with a modern moda. Simply put, this place was designed beautifully.\\n\\nBoutros is a Mediterranean oriented restaurant with a New American twist. \\n\\nThe menu at Boutros consists of easily shareable small plates, pizzas, and large dishes. It was in the starter section that the kitchen really put together some wonderful dishes. We were amazed by the bulgar fried rice accompanied by beef soujouk, egg, enoki mushroom and snow peas that created complexity of wonderful flavor that made me wonder what kind of magic went into this simple-looking dish. Grilled Octopus, potato puree, chutney, and Chive was also remarkable. Every bite was delicious with a lot of different ingredients working together in harmony. In my opinion, the best item we tried all night was something we didn't even order, it was the Maitake Mushroom. The chef/owner stopped by our table to ask about our dining experience, but also to have us try this delicious hen of the woods complements of him. The refreshing sensation from the dish and the textural effect from the combination of different ingredients was quite memorable. We were practically scraping the plate trying to get the very last drops of the sweet tahini drizzle. We also opted to try the clam pizza as a starter. Another great dish to share. The clams and lemon sat well together on pizza dough that was just the right amount of crust and crunch. For a main dish, we split the lone pasta dish at Boutros: the angel hair with asparagus, pistachio, and ricotta salata. Erika was surprised with presentation of the dish, but the overall balance of flavor was still there.  We skipped dessert as we were both very full and satisfied from all the outstanding food I mentioned above. However, our waiter did bring us over two lemon meringue macaroons which hit the spot.    \\n\\nOverall, we were pleased with the overall direction of the kitchen that emphasizes the freshness of locally sourced Middle Eastern ingredients found right here on Atlantic Avenue. I can definitely see this restaurant becoming quite popular among local Brooklynites. We will for sure be back.\", u'We really enjoyed our meal.  They were out of their world famous octopus -- so we had the grilled haloumi and water melon salad on wilted greens,  hen we has a delicious side of \"peas\" -- English greek sugar snap and snow peas in a delicious sauce.  They brought us a warm roll. But it was not accompanied by butter,spread or olive oil.  The bass had crispy scales on it..ion a bed of greens and a curry sauce.  It was tasty but the fish was no cooked well enough.  The pork chop with grilled peaches was awesome!  \\n\\nWe skipped why wines -- kind of pricey - lowest was $12 for a Rioja?  But we had a fresh glass of lemonade which complimented the food beautiful. Our sweet waiter was kind -- and offered to turn on the AC to combat the heat of summer.  The owner is a warm host and his son runs the kitchen. We will be back for the octopus.', u'Absolutely fantastic food, ambiance and service! They kindly accepted to make the Ricotta Agnolotti vegetarian- plus the menu is overall vegetarian friendly. The strawberry Knafah is really good. Highly recommend!!', u\"I love when it's easy to give a place five stars - and this is one of those places. \\n\\nHad a superb experience here last night. It's such a delight to walk into a neighborhood restaurant and be treated... like a neighbor! The service was wonderful from the moment we arrived. \\n\\nEverything we ordered was excellent. The flavor combinations are beautiful - a lot going on in every plate, but incredibly balanced (which is hard to pull off). My favorites were the spring peas with hummus and black garlic, and the foie gras fritters, which we had to start. Even the rolls are special! They're baked with za'atar (how can you go wrong being next door to Sahadi's?) and are served fresh from the oven. The desserts are killer too. Absolutely recommend the beignets!\\n\\nThe setting is lovely, the food is as close to perfect as you can get, and the people are friendly and attentive. So glad to have this place nearby!\", u'The food and service here was terrific. We shared a number of plates and had great cocktails. \\n\\nGreat ambiance and bar as well!  Definitely check it out.', u\"Such an amazing addition to the neighborhood.  Everything from the ambiance/decor, to the service, and most notably the food exceeded my expectations.  I haven't written a review here on Yelp for almost a decade but you guys need to RUN NOT WALK to Boutros.\\n\\nI shared the duck confit pizza as an appetizer -- it was DELICIOUS and particularly exciting because it was my first pizza in my life due to my cheese allergy.  Sea bass entree was made perfect by the celery root sauce.  We capped it off with the beignets and merengue macarons.  The decision isn't so much whether I'll be back, but rather whether I will order the same things since I loved it so much or venture out to some of the other interesting items on the menu.\", u\"I went with Hannah H., who beat me to the review, so I won't repeat everything she said, but I do concur on all fronts. It's a very attractive, comfortable space. The food is excellent; well thought out and executed dishes, super fresh ingredients. And everyone who works there clearly wants you to enjoy yourself, which we did. Will be going back to check out more of the menu very soon.\", u\"I went to Boutros with a party of 4, no reservation during the holiday week between Xmas and New Year on a Tuesday evening around 7:30pm.\\n\\nThe food was good, but as others have noted the portions are very small. The menu is split between 'small plates' and 'large plates'. My husband ordered the Ricotta Agnoletti (basically ravioli) which was a large plate for almost $20 and it was not a lot of food at all. I ordered the Lasagnetta which is like tagliatelli with a carrot ragu and mushrooms. It was also a large plate, and while it wasn't as small as my husband's entree, I was definitely still hungry after eating. For dessert we split the beignets which were great, but again very small.\\n\\nMy larger issue was with the service. While our waiter was friendly, he did not seem very experienced and his explanations of the food (when asked questions) were somewhat unclear. For example, I asked 'how thin the pizza crust was' and he struggled to describe it and ended up saying something like 'it's thin if you press it flat.'\\n\\nThe restaurant was half empty, however for some reason the other waitperson (a woman) kept passing behind my chair which was positioned somewhat closely to the corner chair of the community table even though I think she could have taken a different route and avoided the narrow passthrough. She knocked into a tote bag I had hanging on my chair three times, each time actually moving my chair when she hit it. The third time she knocked in to my chair she actually knocked my bag on the floor. She didn't really apologize but instead looked backwards and looked slightly annoyed. My questions were 1) if it was in her way, why didn't she ask me to move my bag 2) or why didn't she adjust the chair of the community table (which was completely empty) if the opening was too narrow 3) why didn't she go a different way 4) why didn't she apologize :-)\\n\\nAll that said, we probably won't be back. The interior of the restaurant is nice, and hopefully they will get a better rhythm going with their service as time goes on. The food is good, it's just very expensive for what you get, especially considering the service.\", u\"Could not ask for more from this AWESOME neighborhood addition. Been here twice for dinner in the past two weeks - the service and food were completely on point both times. Wait staff is friendly, energetic, engaging and not at all pretentious and the food is fantastic... I've tried most of the menu at this point and every single dish has exceeded my expectations. The ingredients are fresh, everything is cooked to perfection and the variety of spices and flavors the chef uses in each dish pleasantly surprise the palette.  \\n\\nThe menu descriptions don't do the food justice; everything is REALLY good, but the Angel Hair pasta and the Maitake mushroom are among my faves. The knafeh dessert is also delicious (am usually more of a chocolate person, but the flavors in the knafe were perfection). \\n\\nCan't wait to try brunch!! :)\", u'Great service, great atmosphere....\\nHowever.. the \"chicken\" dish I had was confusing. I couldn\\'t quite put my finger what the chef was going for. 27 bucks for a tasteless chicken breast?  I\\'ll come back and order something different.', u\"Extremely delicious food you don't feel bad about eating. A healthy meal without the sacrifice of taste! I've been to Boutros twice with my husband and parents since it's opening and both times the food was outstanding. It is consistent and I have tried almost everything on the menu! The must order apps are definitely the bulgar fried rice and octopus, which are cooked to perfection. My favorite main is the lasagnette! But my husband loves the beef and broccoli! When I say you can't go wrong at Boutros, I mean it!\\n\\nThe manager is also extremely attentive and professional. We loved our experience and will be return patrons.\", u'My husband and I ate here last night for an early pre-movie dinner.  I could not believe how few people apparently know about this gem.  (Granted, it was 6pm.)  People- please.  YOU MUST EAT HERE.  The food is excellent.  The cocktails are to die for and the atmosphere is lovely.', u\"This is an unusually interesting and very good restaurant that seems not to have been discovered yet. We've eaten the pasta, duck and bass there. All had flavors we have never tasted. The desserts were also excellent.\"], u'45.Olmsted': [u'For my money, Olmsted is the best restaurant in NY.  I\\'m sure you could pay $500 bucks/person for a mind-blowing omakase or tasting menu somewhere in Manhattan...but my wife and I shared six dishes and five drinks here for $140 plus tip last time.  The math is easy.  \\n\\nFood-wise, the menu here has changed a bit over time, so it\\'s hard to single out particular dishes as must have, with the exception of the carrot crepe.  I doubt they\\'ll ever take it off the menu, and for good reason.  It tastes like the purest, butteriest carrot you\\'ve ever had, with pops of salt from the clams, and it\\'s visually stunning when it arrives.  Other than that, I don\\'t think you can go wrong.  We\\'ve never had a bad dish here, and they do everything well.  Standouts last time were the battered squash rings (somewhere between a healthy onion ring and an everything bagel), squash som tum (bracingly spicy), pork belly roulade (unusually soft, but still with the crispy seared flavor), and the chocolate mousse.  The \"secret\" yakitori menu is a new development.  I thought the flavor of the chicken thighs and the king oyster mushrooms was outstanding, but it was a very insubstantial dish for $24 -- maybe the first thing I\\'ve ever had here that wasn\\'t great value for the money.\\n\\nDrinks here are fantastic as well.  Can\\'t go wrong with any of the cocktails (my wife\\'s lemon balm was one of the best scotch drinks I\\'ve ever tried, and if you come in the fall/winter the warm drinks are nice), and the beer and wine are well-priced.  The rotating four taps are always interesting choices from great brewers (Kent Falls, Sloop, Troegs, etc) at $6-7 a glass.  \\n\\nYes, it\\'s a tough reservation, but you can usually get a table at 9:00 pm or later less than a week out.  Service is always super friendly, especially at the bar.  Come early and have a drink in the backyard (it\\'s beautiful and warm year-round), or move out there after eating for some s\\'mores after dinner.  Or both.  You\\'ll probably want to stay for a while.', u\"Commitment is hard. You want to invest your heart and loyalty into something, but you don't know if they're going to be around. That's the deal with restaurants on Vanderbilt Avenue. \\n\\nThe shelf life for a restaurant on Vanderbilt isn't long. Cooklyn, which was where Olmstead is, was such a hit. It had to last, NOPE! Vanderbilt is weird. One day it's all quiet. The next three Korean spots open within a week. \\n\\nI'm here to tell you Olmsted is here to stay. Promise! Whether or not you'll be alive the next time reservation is available is another story. Seriously, please attempt to make one now. One might be available in six years. \\n\\nKidding aside if you want to go sometime soon, I got two options for you. First, Mondays. Everyone's least favorite day of the week. Here, Mondays are no reservation. So you can just walk right in, and hope to snag a table. You're gonna wait, so you may want to go on the earlier side or wait till a lousy, cold, dreary day in which people don't like going out. (Survival is for the fittest) Your other option is to sit at the bar. First come, first serve. You have to get there right away though. Olmsted opens at five right now, but their hours can change, so be sure to check in with them or their website if you plan to do that. \\n\\nMy first time there I got their early went for the bar seating. I personally enjoy Bar seating so it was grand for me. Three of us perched up there and began our journey. The drinks here are top of the line. The cocktails are well designed and pack a good punch. I personally enjoyed the Lavender. \\n\\nWe kicked our meal off with the cauliflower with pickled red onions. Excellent starter. If you can only get one small dish though, go with the mullet tartare. Simply delicious. The rutabaga tagliatelle was so good we got it twice. Well it was by mistake, but it's that good you may want to order two servings. The scallops were lovely. Not too filling but very tasty. Last we had the big hype dish. The guinea hen. This is their star, and it shines. Succulent, juicy, and tender. Paired with a sauce that compliments it perfectly. We ate every morsel. Make sure you get it. \\n\\nThe space is intimate and pleasant. Beautiful store front. The service is impeccable. The bartenders and waitstaff are fantastic. All very nice and friendly. \\n\\nSo if you're looking for a special place to book your special someone's next birthday, ehhh you might not be able to swing it here, maybe two birthdays from now you can get a reservation. Or just wing it on a Monday or right when they open. Either way, you have to come here.\", u'After a bunch of mediocre overpriced food on our recent NY trip I wanted to end it with One Wonderful Meal and this was it!  It\\'s hard to get a table but it was Sunday night and we were seated at the bar, with a wonderful server (and one not so charming when he took a break).  \\n\\nNot only was everything we ate innovative and surprising, but it was also absolutely delightful and delicious!  And everything was served on and it the most wonderful hand made dishes, which seriously added to my experience for every minute I was there.  (If it hadn\\'t been my last night, I would have rushed to the studio where it was made the next day!)\\n\\nWe had the Watermelon Sushi (only wished the slices of fish had been a bit heftier) which was a great combo I will try at home, slices of squash which were a fabulous textural and taste combination, a fantastic salmon tartare -- far from the usual take on this dish -- beautifully served in a little jar with crispy treats to spread it on, and Crab Rangoon Dumplings, yum!  My husband usually doesn\\'t feel satisfied with a bunch of small plates, but even he was charmed and delighted with what we had here.\\n\\nLooking forward to another trip to sample more at this lovely place, with a garden and little \"farm\" in the back yard!', u'Olmsted is a creative and beautiful New American restaurant in Brooklyn with a stylish dining room matched by a spectacular backyard garden. I managed to obtain a reservation for one at this highly sought after restaurant and was very impressed.\\n\\nI began with raw oysters, which were covered in pickled beets, horseradish crema, and caviar. They were beautiful & quite possibly the perfect food.\\n\\nNext, I had the \"Green Eggs & Ham\", which was trout brined like ham & diced. It was covered with green egg whites beaten until fluffy. Four brioche roasts were provided to smear trout upon. It was salty, but delicious like a hearty breakfast & a very creative plate. Today was the first day it was on the menu & a manager stopped by my chair to ask for my impressions. I thought this was a nice touch.\\n\\nI finished with the dry rubbed sea scallops. They were topped with diced Serrano peppers. Cream corn sauce was for dipping. It was very spicy but delicious.\\n\\nMy only criticism is that Olmsted would benefit from a certified Cicerone and more extensive beer menu.\\n\\nNew York has endless array of outstanding restaurants, but I would love to visit Olmsted again.', u\"I've only heard great things about this place and getting reservations is almost impossible so when I was finally able to get a table, you could only expect my excitement and anticipation to be over the roof. However, I can say I was pretty disappointed. \\n\\nYes, clearly the quality of the ingredients is extremely high, but a lot of the dishes tasted like things I could honestly put together at home (minus the presentation skills). That's not to say it's a bad thing, but maybe it's not worth the waiting a month for a table and overpaying for the food that you could easily make in your own kitchen. Regarding price, this place is not that expensive, it's a solid $$ according to Yelp standards, however, how much you're getting for each dish almost feels like you're being ripped off-- particularly with the entrees.\\n\\nWe ordered the yakitori which was about $24, and only comes with three skewers of your choice. The yakitori was pretty delicious, however it's just so ridiculously overpriced for the amount you're getting. It does come with a small spicy eggplant dish and a small radish dish. The spicy eggplant tasted like it was doused in Tabasco sauce and frankly it offended me because this is kind of a classic example of a chef trying to cook Asian dishes without a full understanding of the spices and ingredients that go into them. We also ordered the roast beef carpaccio entree and honestly why would anyone ever thing to put a deli meat item on a menu at a fine dining restaurant like this? It didn't taste too bad, but it is fair to say i was extremely disappointed. \\n\\nThe redeeming qualities of this place was that the kale crab Rangoon was absolutely delicious and I would probably come back for the lavender frozen yogurt alone. The Yuzu cocktail was also delicious. The service was great as well, our waiter noticed we did not finish our roast beef carpaccio and asked for feedback. He did mention it was a new dish and when I told him honestly how I felt, he thanked me for the honestly. And he even took it off the menu which was extremely kind of him because we weren't expecting it! \\n\\nI will try to give this place another shot. Before coming, I read more recent reviews stating how this season's menu is a little mediocre than past seasons, so I'll try to come back in the winter and hopefully will have a better review for you! \\n\\nWe ordered the kale crab rangoon which was probably the best thing I had tasted\", u\"I had been wanting to try Olmsted since Pete Wells raved about them nearly a year ago. Reservations have to be made wayyyyy in advance, but I was somehow able to score a res for 4 at 8:30 on a Sunday. Maybe the 4th of July weekend had us lucking out, since everyone was gone from the city.\\n\\nOlmsted is gorgeous--plants line the walls and their outdoor garden in the back, where they get some of the produce they serve in the restaurant, also has cocktail tables outside. The crowd was bizarre--it was a mix of normal people and some of the absolute worst in Brooklyn hipster that I've seen. People kept going out to the back, and every one kept looking more and more bizarre (I'm talking about you, man in striped suspenders and a straw hat). \\n\\nANYWAYS, that's beside the point. The waiter said a light meal was 4 items from each portion of the menu (snacks, appetizer, entree) and it wasn't common to do the entire menu. We ordered 2 snacks, 3 apps, and 3 entrees, and it was more than enough. Honestly, this made me feel like he was pushing an upsell...not a great thing for fine dining.\\n\\nSo, besides that, everything was immaculate. The crawfish boil crackers, seemingly made from puffed rice, were delicious. Fried pickles--all kinds of pickled vegetables--were wonderful.\\n\\nThe crispy fried pork belly came with a delicious, homemade buckwheat cracker on top, and it was delicious. The bluefish salad was incredible--perfectly cured, and it tasted like it was just smoked. The way the cold wafted from the salad was quite pleasing to the eye. The carrot crepe was weird, amazing, and wild. You should get it.\\n\\nEntrees were the same. Delicious English pea falafel with fresh mini pitas and labne were delightful. The house-cured pastrami was truly, truly excellent, and the pieces of potato underneath were a real treat. The showstopper, though, was the trout. The emulsion with trout roe was unreal, and the trout--wrapped in chard--was flawlessly cooked and executed.\\n\\nWe were stuffed from that (not 4-4-4, but 2-3-3), but still shared the chocolate mousse. It was simple, classic, and delicious.\\n\\nSO, why 4 stars? Well, I didn't like the upsell, and although Olmsted was delicious, I still can't come close to putting it above (or on par) with Battersby. When the menu changes, as it undoubtedly does with the season, I will definitely be back. Maybe they'll get that magical 5th star.\\n\\ntl;dr: Make reservations way in advance. Absolutely delicious. Not quite as good as Battersby. Go there now.\", u\"Came here on a weekday around 6pm. Was told there was a 2 hour wait. Sure thats fine, so we head on over to the backyard garden area to wait and have some appetizers. Nice seating area- we decided to order crawfish crackers, and snap pea sushi. Crawfish crackers were delicious, flavorful and crispy. Definitely wish there were more pieces! Snap pea sushi was ehh, but refreshing. \\n\\nAfter a long wait, we were finally called in for seating. We ordered the carrot crepe. dry rubbed scallops, and the trout. Let me tell you, if you are hungry or impatient. This is not the place for you!! Each dish takes forever to come and the kitchen in my opinion is too small for the amount of people being served. Portion size is laughable for entrees. But really I will be basing my review on the flavor. \\n\\nCarrot crepe- Tasty rich flavor, the sauce that its served in is delicious. Serving size I would describe is like a small tapa plate. There were a few pieces of garnish on top that didn't go well with the dish.\\n\\nDry rubbed scallops- Scallops came in a single skewer (3 pieces) with a side of dipping sauce. Scallops were extremely small. They were like the size of 1 scallop cut up into 3 pieces. For $20, I would expect a little larger portion size.. However the scallops were delicious. The dipping sauce went well with it. \\n\\nTrout- This dish was super delicous!! I just wished the serving size wasn't like two bitefuls. Fish was buttery and moist. Spinach fresh, and the sauce is to die for. Took almost an hour to come though. \\n\\nOverall ok experience. Food tasted great, but portion sizes leave you wanting for more! My advise, don't come here on an empty stomach or if you are on time constraint. Expect a long wait on eveything.\", u\"900th review? That's cool.\\n\\nQuite excellent. Olmsted came with a lot of hype attached (James Beard Award nominee for 2017), and I'd have to say it's well-deserved. It took quite a while to get an OpenTable reservation at a reasonable time, but after some patience, our visit finally happened. The decor seems very meticulously thought-out, with lots of plants and vines hanging all over the indoor space, and a really nice outdoor backyard patio, complete with blankets when it's cold out. They really thought of everything.\\n\\nWhat we got:\\n- Popcorn monkfish: Tasty, but not really worth the value. The portion is really small, and the monkfish, while delicious, is cut into really small pieces and it's hard to derive any real monkfish flavor.\\n- Charred onion chawanmushi with smoked trout roe and maitake: really delicious, and had a nice salty taste, without being too fishy.\\n- Carrot crepe with littleneck clams: beautifully plated, but perhaps needed a few more clams with it.\\n- Guinea hen confit and roasted: Both versions were really great, and while we obviously preferred the confit, the roasted guinea hen portion did not have a dry bite throughout the dish.\\n- Frozen yogurt with lavender honey: quite amazing, and really hit the spot. The lavender flowers are a nice touch, and the cream with yogurt really made for a great dessert that wasn't too sweet.\\n\\nOur server gave great recommendations and really knew her stuff about the wines, so that was greatly appreciated. The prices are a bit more expensive, but overall, the value is really good, given the quality of the ingredients, and the care they put into plating and execution.\\n\\nOverall, not every dish was a knockout, but I would still give it 5 stars because there were some really amazing dishes, and the overall experience just left us feeling really good. Definitely a great time for a date or a small group. If you can get a seat in the backyard patio for just lounging, it seems like a really nice romantic spot. I will definitely be back to try their other offerings, and looking forward to see their seasonal dishes.\", u\"1 star: aka AVOID. \\n\\n Never going back\\nVery nice place.  Very helpful with suggestions etc.\\n\\n45 minute wait between dishes.  So let's make that clear, we put in an order.  The restaurant only makes a few dishes.  Somehow between our app & our main they miscalculated by 45 minutes.  Our server was so ashamed he comped us $40 worth of drinks, which is nice.  But we still missed our movie afterwards - which we planned 1 day in advance.  So no comp is gonna help with that.  \\n\\nFood was good, no doubt.  Definitely way over priced for what you get: $5 per perogi.  We've come to expect graphically overpriced goods in NYC kitchens.  However the 30-45 minute wait between dishes seals the fate of this place.  Sunday night and they can't handle the well expected guests.  That means one thing, you don't know how to handle your restaurant.  And if you can't do that, you can't expect good reviews, no matter how well executed your dishes are.\", u\"The food is good. The aesthetic is charming and the attention to detail with dish ware is a lovely touch. However, the service style does not match the expectations set by the menu's complexity and price point. The service is friendly, but not terribly attentive or structured - very average. \\nDining at Olmsted, should not be discouraged. I did not received what I had expected in my overall dining experience, but I would say it's a good restaurant for the area. \\nI recommend the Duck Liver Mousse! The honey on top is a great touch and the pickled melon is an excellent compliment.\", u'I guess you just cannot ignore it - this neighborhood restaurant dual owned by chef Greg Baxtrom and farmer Ian Rothman, both had various experience trained at restaurant pearls including Alinea, Blue Hill at Stone Barns, and had met each other during the Atera period.\\n\\nInstead of being over complicated, Olmsted carried a rather simple menu. With a small group, we were actually able to sample many dishes. Good thing is that each course was relatively small in size, so one would not complain about over-stuffed. While each plate was almost close to flawless, I would recommend the scallop, the uni dumpling, and the best-dessert-on-earth - that lavender frozen yogurt. This seasonal-driven, ingredient oriented menu has lots of food coming directly from their backyard garden, which was literally just several tables away from where we dined.\\n\\nEstablished only months back last year, I already saw it grasping numerous awards - two stars from Pete Wells, the hottest restaurant ranked in Brooklyn, and potentially a Michelin star next year.\\n\\nBy the time we concluded our dinner, it was already close to midnight so we had to defer our garden visit to next time; yet all of us left with full satisfaction. Think Greg and his gang really nailed it, and in their own way!', u\"I finally made it here to this high-demand restaurant .. enjoyed dinner:\\n\\nGobi pakora cauliflower\\nMorgan's meats (guinea hen liver mousse)\\nSweet potato and uni pierogies\\nCarrot crepe\\nDuck chankna with pear chutney\\nRutabaga tagliatelle\\nGuinea hen roasted and confit\\nPork collar\\n\\nHighlights were the carrot crepe and guinea hen (liver mousse under snacks; and the entree (roasted and confit). Very creative and flavorful execution. The pork and the duck dishes were wonderful as well but the must-haves are the former \\n\\nThe Gobi pakora cauliflower was a tad oily. The pierogies were dry almost overcooked ...per the description seemed like a strange combination. I like sweet potato and I like uni but unfortunately this was a miss for me\\n\\nThe tagliatelle was surprisingly bland. \\n\\nThe Swiss miss hot chocolate drink seemed light as was the old fashioned chocolate mousse but I enjoyed the mousse with the creme fraiche - nice way to end the meal with a fluffy creamy chocolate dessert \\n\\nDespite the couple of dishes I could've done without I really enjoyed being there and overall enjoyed the meal. Service was very good. The garden out in the back is where they grow most of their ingredients and where you can enjoy s'mores and drinks.\", u\"For a table of six, we ordered 3 appetizers, all 6 of the small plates, 4 main entree dishes, 4 desserts and all left a little hungry \\n\\nWe constantly asked the server for her opinion on the amount ordered and she really should have recommended we course out our plates differently. Maybe we didn't enjoy the meal because we had a good 30 mins between every set of plates to idle and go through the wine. Feel like I would get a better meal elsewhere \\n\\nLiked the food but probably not enough to come back - would recommend the chawanmushi and the bluefish crackers\", u\"Had a very nice meal at Olmsted. Nice quality, seasonal ingredients, thoughtfully prepared and presented. Interesting cocktails that also were clearly seasonally inspired. \\n\\nI don't know if we hit them at an odd time, but we had a hard time choosing the right combination of dishes. Not a hard time because there were too many choice, but because there weren't enough that were totally of interest. The main meats on offer were a yakitori platter (3 skewers for $24 was a hefty price tag) and a cold pastrami platter (which appealed less upon arrival at the table next to us than that even sounds on paper - the whole point of pastrami is the luxurious fattiness in a warm, oozy sandwich. Cold pastrami is like a day without sunshine).\\n\\nWe were instructed to order 2 small, 2 medium, 2 large dishes. It was at least 1 large too many, particularly because at least 4 of the dishes were served with crackers, bread or some other bread like component, which were nice but very filling. Liked the duck mousse and the snap pea sushi, the bluecrab dip was very taste. The carrot crepe was very pretty and a surprisingly interesting plate. The two mains we had did not blow us away.  Scallops were a sadly humdrum affair with a very odd presentation. For $23, I expected better. One scallop was about 2/3 of the scallop in one piece, and the other was two poorly cut pieces. Not even 2 scallops and maybe 2 pieces of mushroom in a broth. For all the talk about making this an affordable neighborhood option, we felt a little cheated on that one.\\n\\nThe english pea falafel was served with a wonderful labneh, but I'd take Taim over this any day at 1/3 of the price. We also agonized a bit over even ordering something like this here, but frankly, the other options on offer just didn't appeal. We expected more.\\n\\nSo, that said, we will definitely consider another go at Olmsted in the future, when their seasonal menu is more in line with our expectations.  It's a very nice place where they clearly take great care with their food and the service.  We look forward to a time when the menu has better main options on offer!\", u'Items Selected:\\nRhubarb - Blanco Tequila, Lime, Bitter Orange, Salt Foam, Tonic\\nCrawfish Boil Crackers\\nMorgan\\'s Meats - Pork Rillettes, Pickled Red Onions\\nPopcorn Monkfish - Aioli\\nChawanmushi - Nori, Crispy Scallions\\nDuck Chakna - Red Lentil Naan,  Pear Chutney\\nCarrot Crepe - Little Neck Clams, Sunflower\\nRutabaga Tagliatelle - Burgundy Black Truffle, Brown Butter\\nSauteed Soft Shell Crab - Pickled Peppers, Ranch Dressing, Ramps\\nHorizonte - Columbia\\nLa Joya - Ecuador\\nCaramel Apple Donuts - Salty Caramel Sauce\\nS\\'mores - Housemade Marshmallows, Artisan Graham Crackers, Hershey\\'s\\n\\nOwned and operated by Greg Baxtrom and Ian Rothman out in Prospect Heights, the concept at first seeming much the same as many with a Chef-driven menu based on seasonality, Olmsted differentiates itself from the pack by way of a backyard Garden and living wall from which many of its ingredients are sourced, the 50-seat space a near-impossible reservation after receiving attention as a Best New Restaurant contender at the James Beard Foundation Awards.\\n\\nNamed after a deceased local architect, the narrow and straight space leading to a garden where a fire-pit offering Drinks, small Bites and a special Dessert experience offers additional seating for approximately a dozen, those visiting Olmsted will be greeted promptly at the hostess podium where reservations are confirmed before being led to one of many wood tables, the noise level near the front far more quiet than at the back, in part due to the location of speakers and in part due to the fact that the bar and kitchen lie along the same wall, which thus compresses many of the tables against a brick wall lined in Plants. \\n\\nOpen as a first-come-first-serve restaurant on Mondays only, the other days booked as soon as reservations open via the website, it was after getting comfortable that menus were presented along with verbalized daily specials and a clipboard Cocktail list, the prices occasionally precocious, though the presentations and flavors are frequently on par with several of New York\\'s top fine dining establishments.\\n\\nBeginning with a Cocktail and Water, the plates rustic and attractive though cups are unnecessarily small which necessitates servers leaving pitchers of water with the table, fans of innovative drinks have already made \"Give Peas a Chance\" a social media sensation, the Tequila-based \"Rhubarb\" not as photogenic but fresh and refreshing which paired well with Crawfish Boil Crackers that tasted exactly as they are named with the texture of Chicharr\\xf3n while a daily dish entitled \"Morgan\\'s Meats\" featured smooth shredded Pork served with Toast and Pickled Onions.\\n\\nContinuing with \"Snacks,\" Chef Baxtrom no stranger to crafting single bites with complexity and big flavor following stints at Alinea, Atera and Blue Hill at Stone Barns, Popcorn Monkfish offered a basket of lightly fried Fish alongside Radishes and a herbal Aioli while the daily special Chawanmushi executed on par with any experienced to date stateside, the Custard smooth and jiggly with the flavor of Shellfish and Mushrooms beneath fried Scallions and Nori added for texture.\\n\\nWithout doubt a global menu suited to concept of Vegetable-centric fare and sustainability, the newly famous orange Crepe with trimmed Clams, Sunflower Seeds and razor-thin Carrot slices as delicate and precise as anything one might see at Per Se, Baxtrom\\'s best dish of the night came by way of the Indian-inspired Duck Chakna with confit Fowl ready to be loaded into Naan made with Red Lentils, the Soft-Shell Crab unfortunately a $22 disappointment that was overwhelmed by Peppers, the thick \"Ranch\" sauce sloppily placed on the plate and not really adding much to any of the other ingredients.\\n\\nAppropriately impressed by the Rutabaga Tagliatelle, thin strips of the Tuber lightly steamed into al dente low-calorie Noodles and topped with sliced Black Truffles in Brown Butter, it was with two distinctly different styles of drip Coffee that a bag of Bombolini were enjoyed, the flavor not unlike that of a Cider Donut before being dipped into creamy Caramel Sauce, a fifteen minute wait quickly passed before the party of three was led out back to the Garden where sleeping Doves in cages watch diners place housemade Marshmallows on sticks before blackening them over a can of Embers and smashing them between Graham Crackers from a local Bakery plus a 50-cent Hershey Bar for twenty bucks, the cost largely related to time and taking up space rather than ingredient quality here, but worth it for the novelty and fun-factor.', u'A lot of hype on this place, and it lived up to it. We got (in order of how much I liked it):\\n\\n- Morgan\\'s meats\\n- Male mullet tartare\\n- Sweet potato & uni pierogies\\n- Crawfish boil crackers\\n- Carrot crepe\\n- Rutabaga \"tagliatelle\"\\n\\nMy wife would have them ordered differently -- she was a little freaked out by the texture of the meats, and she absolutely loved the pierogies (that was easily her #1). \\n\\nThat said, we loved almost everything. We started with the crawfish crackers (recommended by the Michelin inspector\\'s Twitter account the day before...), which were excellent. The meats were weird but incredible -- I forgot to ask exactly what it was, but it was essentially gelled meats in some kind of honey (I think?) that you smear on toast. Really amazing. The tartare was a close second for me. I really liked the pierogies as well, but not quite as much as my wife -- she said it was one of her favorite things she had eaten in a while, and she kept talking about them the day after. \\n\\nWe both really liked the carrot crepe, but thought it was somewhat overrated -- the clams and the crepe itself were great, but not as mindblowing as some of the other dishes we got. We also were really excited for the tagliatelle (which was from from rutabaga, not actual pasta), but I don\\'t think we\\'d get it again -- the lamb and hen looked incredible, and I think we\\'d sub those in as our main(s) next time.\\n\\nThis place is clearly still in its hype phase -- we made a reservation almost a month out and the best we could get was 9:45 on a Thursday -- but I get it, and I hope it\\'s around for a long time. Can\\'t wait to go back and try things once the menu turns over again. (The menu we had looked pretty different than the menu from the summer.)', u'First off, this is a very trendy spot. How do I know that? Because there is a wait for reservation and you HAVE to make a reservation if you want to eat here or maybe just wait for the hype to die down?\\n\\nI came here with 3 other girlfriends at 5:30pm on a weekday and it was packed! The space is small with some outdoor seating in the backyard (weather permitting). In fact, you can see the kitchen tucked in the back, that\\'s how small this place is. But it has a very cozy vibe and it\\'s lighting is very dimmed so not the greatest at taking pics for instagram. \\n\\nFor a table of 4 girls, we ordered an appetizer to share and a main dish and drink each:\\nPopcorn monkfish (app) - super tasty or we were super hungry since no pics were taken which means we devoured this within 30 seconds of it arriving on our table.\\n\\nCarrot crepe with littleneck clams - this seems like their signature dish since everyone orders it. I thought it tasted great but wish it had a few more clams to it. The clams were more like a garnish than an ingredient.\\n\\nGrilled Scallops - 4 pieces with a bit of salad. I had to look again to make sure I ordered the entree and not an appetizer. The scallops were grilled perfectly without being chewy or rubbery but this was nothing special in my opinion. \\n\\nRutabaga \"Tagliatelle\" - I thought this dish fell short for sure. It was the least favorite among the dishes we ordered because it was over salted. I do think once a dish is over salted, there\\'s not much you can do to save it.\\n\\nGuinea hen confit and roasted: This dish surprised me the most because I always feel chicken dish are ordinary and nothing special. This was flavored just right and it was not dry at all, even the roasted version. The sauce it comes with is amazing.\\n\\nOverall: I think the food was really good minus 1 dish but we did leave still slightly hungry. For the price, I say it\\'s an experience and a nice place to have dinner out if you feel like splurging. Definitely not your everyday dinner spot for sure.', u\"We've been wanting to go to Olmsted for a long time, and we were definitely not disappointed. The restaurant itself and the garden are beautiful, and the entire place just feels completely comfortable. The service was friendly and helpful too.\\n\\nFor our party of two, we ended up ordering 2 snacks, 3 smaller plates, and 2 larger plates along with 2 desserts and it was definitely enough food. Along with the regular menu that you can find online, they also brought over a clipboard with yakitori selections and a chawanmushi special, which ended up being our favorite dish all night. The rich flavor of the dashi, the perfect texture, everything about it was fantastic.\\n\\nOther highlights included the pastrami which came with sides of slaw, potato salad, and cornbread. The mustard sauce that came with the pastrami was really tasty. We also liked the English pea falafel in part because of the fluffy bread that seemed to also have peas mixed into the dough, the bluefish salad which was packed with flavor, and the carrot crepe which was so unique and well-executed along with looking like a piece of art. Both desserts we got - the yogurt with lavender honey and soft serve (vanilla lilac and sour cherry swirl) were the perfect ending to the meal.\\n\\nWhile we had an overall wonderful experience, not every dish worked for me, although that might have more to do with personal preference. While tasty, I found the crawfish boil crackers a little too salty. My least favorite was the duck liver mousse as it was just too sweet for me, but the server said it was a really popular item so that might just be me. My cocktail seemed to be more ice than drink, which was initially nice because it was hot outside, but I wouldn't get that again. Even with all this though, I still give it 5 stars because overall it was a great dinner.\\n\\nWe definitely want to return to Olmsted, especially in other seasons so we can experience different things on the menu. Everything is seasonal and a lot comes from the backyard garden, so I'm hoping we get to try an entire new slate of dishes when a new season rolls around.\", u'Neighborhoodly restaurant in a way that\\'s laid back and understated, with a kitchen that is making incredible food (and a waiting area that is seriously backyard dreams). Everything sounds decent on paper, but the real thing is so surprisingly good - so creative, delicious and delightful. It\\'s exciting to take a guess at what\\'s going to arrive at your table.\\n\\nThe menu is constantly changing and reinventing itself (even the cocktails), and honestly I\\'ve never had a bad bite. The famous carrot crepe is a perfect example of the type of food you can expect - gorgeous to look at, delicious, and not quite like anything else. Another favorite was lamb porchetta, which was so tender and sat in a delicious sauce, under a blanket of fig leather (mind-blowing). Rutabaga \"Tagliatelle\" was made with such a buttery sauce that I completely forgot I was eating root vegetables rather than pasta (which probably would\\'ve made the dish too heavy). If they have a version of their chawanmushi, definitely get that as well. \\n\\nThere\\'s nothing quick about a meal here, but it\\'s better that way. The food arrives when it\\'s ready, no structured courses. So get ready for a long, lingering meal that\\'s casual yet sophisticated. We opted to sit in their beautiful backyard for dessert, benches amongst plenty of greenery, complete with space heaters and cozy blankets. Sample the chocolate mousse and frozen yogurt with whipped honey (both are amazing), roast marshmallows for some seriously upgraded s\\'mores, pour steamed milk from the thermos to make a mug of hot cocoa (rum optional but highly recommended) -- there is nothing more perfect to end the evening.', u\"Olmsted was one of the most talked about Brooklyn restaurants of 2016, and I can see why.\\n\\nTheir concept itself is great. Their goal is to serve high brow food at... mid brow prices (is that even a term?). Presentation takes a minor backseat to taste, and they'll go ahead and buy that bruised vegetable and pass the savings onto you. Also helps that the place is pretty dimly lit!\\n\\nAnd of course, the head chef has a pedigree that needs no introduction.\\n\\nThat said, get here EARLY. Three of us stopped in right when they opened at 5pm and there was already a line of people waiting. I'm still a relatively young guy, but I'll eat dinner at early bird special times if the meal's this damn good.\\n\\nWe sat at the bar, ordered some inventive cocktails (the Soba and Lavender were both good).\\n\\nThen we ordered a bunch of dishes for sharing.\\n\\nStarted out with the Gobi Pakora cauliflower. It's hard to mess up roasted cauliflower, so expectations weren't that high. But the flavors were excellent. I'm also always a sucker for pickled red onions.\\n\\nOur second dish was the mullet tartare, served with what was essentially fancy chips. Served with cranberry chimichurri on top and a white sauce on the side (don't remember what it was... yogurt? creme fraiche?). It was very similar to ceviche.\\n\\nOur first main was the rutabaga tagliatelle with truffles. This was a favorite. It was closer to pappardelle in terms of width, cut a little short, but oh so rich. The brown butter sauce was so thick, and I've said it before and I'll say it again - truffles is just cheating.\\n\\nSo it was at this point where there was lull in service (SUPER tiny kitchen behind the bar). The bartender said he would check on our next dish, and instead they brought us out another rutabaga tagliatelle by accident. Bartender told us to roll with it, and hell, I never turn down free food.\\n\\nOur penultimate dish was the grilled scallops - skewered, with apple and peanuts on the side. Pretty good scallops, but I've had better elsewhere. Interesting preparation, but I'd skip this one the next time.\\n\\nAnd finally, the piece de resistance was the Guinea hen two ways (roasted & confit). It was just... perfect. Tender, juicy, rich. The breast was served with ramp sauce and roasted sunchoke. The confit was just wonderful. More ramp foam, and morels.\\n\\nThe space is actually pretty big, of like I mentioned before, it's very popular. So make a reservation well in advance, or show up for first-come-first-served bar seating. They also have a backyard, which is super cool.\\n\\nI loved the food, I loved the cocktails, I loved their philosophy.\\n\\nOlmsted is an absolute must for food lovers!\"], u'69.Peaches Shrimp and Crab': [u\"I have long been a fan of Peaches restaurants (obsessed with Smokejoint, live Hot House, and the original Peaches is just finger licking good!) so when my friends and I saw this new little gem pop up in the neighborhood we had to try. \\n\\nMy only critique, is that the title is very misleading. Why isn't there way MORE seafood on the menu? It felt a lot like the regular Peaches with a few seafood options added to the menu. But alas, everything was amazing! \\n\\nI ordered the brown sugar crepes w. Bourbon Peaches and a side of spicy chorizo. My friends had the catfish sandwich and the shrimp + grits. As soon as the food came everyone was quiet and we knew the right brunch decision had been made. Despite its popular name, I am happy to say the wait was not obnoxiously long either. We were seated relatively quickly by a very polite server who was a joy. \\n\\nI can confidently say that I will be back sooner than later. Bedstuy, we've got another winner on our hands!\", u'3.5 stars. After completing a volunteer project, our group of 4 headed here for Sunday brunch today.\\nIt was a friend\\'s recommendation, although 3 of us were dining here for the first time.\\nThis restaurant is located in Clinton Hill in a large, welcoming space. It seemed busy but service was attentive and en pointe.\\nHere\\'s what was ordered:\\nShrimp and grits. My friend bragged that it was really good and judging by its appearance, I would agree.\\nEggs with smoked salmon. The person who ordered this commented that it was quite delicious. And the portion seemed generous.\\nTwo of us (myself included) ordered \"sides\".\\nAs I wasn\\'t too hungry, I selected the 2 eggs, any style. That\\'s all you get for $5. But I also wanted something light to accompany it and felt like having a salad. Although it wasn\\'t on the menu, the waitress accommodated me which was really nice. Thing is, when my order arrived, it was just a plate of greens (arugula at least--my favorite greens). I asked about having some tomatoes or something besides greens and the waitress returned with a small plate of grape tomatoes, onions and capers (huh? which is meant for the capers. I never sprinkle large, salty capers in a salad but whatever). Regardless, it was acceptable and there was no extra charge. The \"salad\" was also $5.\\nOur other friend ordered a side of the 2 eggs any style and the side of blueberry French toast (which looked amazing and just the right portion size for someone like me).\\nAlthough the sides were $5+, the entree prices were standard (trendy) brunch prices. Entrees containing meat or seafood were obviously a few dollars more.\\nIn summary, I enjoyed my experience here and would love to return for a seafood dinner sometime.', u\"This place is one of the finest seafood spots I've been to in NYC!  R&B, Rap, Jazz, Neo Soul plays softly all over the restaurant. I had Blackened Catfish & Cheddar Grits. She had Jumbo Tiger Shrimp with New Potatoes. Both were great. \\n\\nWe had a beautiful time. Will be back next month!\", u\"Mmm... Southern cuisine! My family came here for dinner tonight and we basically ordered the entire menu LOL. My uncle recommend this restaurant and once I saw the Yelp pictures and read the reviews I was of course very interested. \\n\\nOur party was quite large (11 ppl) and we were seated very comfortably since the restaurant is quite spacious. I heard that the other branches are a little snugger. \\n\\nWe started off ordered all the appetizers so that we could sample them all. Avocado Brioche Toast, Fried Calamari, Chicken Wings, House Salad, Grilled Octopus, Fried Green Tomatoes, and Clam Chowder. My favorite was surprisingly the Grilled Octopus since i'm usually not a big fan of octopus. The Chicken Wings were goos too; slightly sweet and slightly sour. Their take on shape of avocado toast was different since it was on a buttered brioche roll cut into quarters. The fried foods were good but not my personal favorite since i'm not a big fan of fried food.\\n\\nI ordered the Salmon (cooked medium) entree served with artichoke, greens, and capers. It was very very well cooked and a good portion for the price. My mom got the Crab Spaghetti which was very buttery and had a good portion of crab meat mixed in. Get this if you like butter noodles! My dad got the steak with fries and greens and the steak was seasoned well and cooked perfectly! The fries were sprinkled with cajun spice. I tried my sister's Clam Chowder and oh my it was soo tasty! It had more depth to it that your typical clam chowder thanks to the bacon and paprika AND it wasn't overly salty. \\n\\nI got to try the mussels from the Red Curry which was absolutely delicious! I would totally order that myself text time. I loved the coconut milk in the curry. It was also served with 2 slices of flatbread. I also tried a jumbo shrimp and piece of lobster tail from the Jim Cane Boil (HUGE btw - perfect for sharing between 2-3 ppl depending on how hungry you are). Both were cooked sooo well! I recommend this! \\n\\nAll the seafood that I tried at Peaches was seasoned and cooked perfectly. They also have sandwiches, crab fried rice, fried chicken, and shrimp & grits that I read were tasty but didn't get the chance to try. I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're in Brooklyn and are craving Southern cuisine. Service is great as well!\", u\"The food was alright, the service was great- the server was really kind and polite. The inside was insanely noisy, so we sat outside in complete darkness, no candles or lights, at least it was quiet. A little too romantic, no? They did give candles to the inside tables, which made no sense. \\n\\nGrilled Octopus ($14)- 5/5 This had white beans, kale and salsa verde as the sauce and was surprisingly good. The kale added a nice texture to it, and I thought the sauce was kind of basic but ended up pairing quite well with the octopus. \\n\\nBlue crab spaghetti ($18)- 3/5 I don't understand the rave for this popular dish. It was very basic pasta to me. It wasn't bad, but I wasn't blown away by it. There was a good amount of crab in it at least. \\n\\nLow Country Seafood Boils Snow Crab Legs ($20)- 3/5 This was good, but a lot of effort needed just for tiny pieces of crab meat. The best part was probably the corn which was delicious and well marinated, although quite small... Potatoes were good too, so was the dipping sauce it came with. The gloves had a strong latex smell, the cracker for the snow crab leg also had a metal taste/smell. But the price for this was decent.\", u'I\\'ve been aware of this place for a while, but didn\\'t give it a chance because \"shrimp & crab\" was in the title, leading me to believe that everything would be $$$. When I finally gave it a shot, I was really pleased to learn that everything was comparable, or at least just a few dollars more than what I\\'d consider to be a more casual meal at my local bar. \\n\\nI got the whiting sandwich (crazy big) and my wife got the shrimp boil. My sandwich was good, and her boil was better. There were a lot of shrimp in it - lucky for me she couldn\\'t eat them all. Wings were good too. \\n\\nWill be back, and maybe give it a 5th star when I\\'m more familiar with the menu!', u\"Was on our way to SoCo but realized their brunch was soon ending so did some research on Yelp and decided to give Peaches a shot. \\n\\nSo glad we did! Although the restaurant wasn't empty (as there were guests both indoors and outdoors) we were greeted and then seated immediately. Our waiter recommended the house punch (I think that's what it's called) but it was sweet yet strong. I was craving the typical chicken and waffles but this wasn't an option on the menu so I ordered chicken and toast. Being that this wasn't what I had in mind, I was surprised at how good this was. The French toast was rich and buttery, full of flavor with a sweet aroma, the syrup wasn't even needed and the toast wasn't soggy. The chicken was really tender and crunchy. The serving size doesn't seem that big on the eyes but it fooled me because I couldn't finish it all. \\n\\nThe prices are super reasonable and everyone is so nice. They were also playing some good tunes. Overall great dining experience and I have to come back one day and try a seafood dish!\", u'I had a craving for crab legs while I was still at work so I turned to the Yelp app in satisfying this urge. Peaches Shrimp and Crab was tucked away in my bookmarks. Always up for crossing a bookmarked restaurant off the list, I convinced a couple co-workers to join me.\\n\\nWe were promptly seated upon arrival and welcomed by our server who was super friendly. I zeroed in on the crab legs on the menu and all the other items became nonexistent. I had the crab legs seafood boil which was well-seasoned in a garlic butter sauce and succulent. My co-workers shared the Jim Cade Boil which was mostly mussels with clams, shrimp and the same amount of crab legs as my order. We had drinks which were okay; nothing memorable.\\n\\nI would definitely come back because they give you a decent amount of seafood for the price and it all tasted so fresh. They should offer more side options though.', u'We live down the street from Peaches Shrimp and Crab, so we\\'ve been here a BUNCH of times for brunch, lunch, and dinner - and everything in between (snacks, drinks, you name it haha). In fact, we started coming here when it was still called Marietta\\'s.\\n\\nI\\'m gonna share my faves from each menu!\\n\\nBRUNCH:\\n- Catfish and grits - this comes with a corn & microgreens \"salsa\" and a tomato sauce on the side. This is probably the dish I crave for brunch from here the most often because it\\'s SO flavorful but, weirdly, feels very light because of the corn & microgreens as well as the catfish itself (which is served sort of blackened). The grits are super creamy and a perfect vehicle to pick up all that delicious, savory tomato sauce. As long as you like catfish (which I do!!!), this is something you definitely must try.\\n- Maine lobster egg scramble - I didn\\'t order this myself but I wanted to. My boyfriend actually ordered this and it was just so yummy. It comes with a side salad of mixed greens very lightly but perfectly dressed. The scramble includes a shellfish butter, so the whole thing tastes ever-so-slightly of the lobster with actual chunks of lobster also throughout.\\n- Crab cake benedict - All of their benedicts are good but this one is my fave. Disclaimer for any other Marylanders out there - this isn\\'t what you\\'d think of when you think \"crab cake\". Hoooowever, their crab cakes ARE still delicious. It\\'s very light with great seasonings (no Old Bay though, I don\\'t think hehe). The addition of the chiles and scallions is perfect and makes the whole dish very fresh. They make their benedicts on brioche, which is decadent and really sops up the egg yolks and hollandaise. Yum!\\n* Definitely get the coffee, it\\'s delish!\\n\\nLUNCH/DINNER:\\n- Long Island whiting sandwich - this. freaking. dish. I think this was one of the first things I tried here and I still go back for it over and over again. First of all, this thing is HUGE. There are like... three FULL filets of fried whiting served open faced on the bun. It comes with yummy seasoned fries and some housemade tartar sauce. I often have to pull two pieces of whiting out of the sandwich and eat the sandwich itself with just one piece of fish. The other two I\\'ll fork and knife and dip into tartar sauce OR take home as leftovers and eat later. It\\'s soo much delicious food. Definitely ask for the hot sauce, it\\'s such a good addition to the sandwich.\\n- Shrimp and grits - I know I already wrote about the catfish and grits above but the shrimp and grits are totally different though you\\'d think they might be the same. This is served with kale and mushrooms with chilies and the white wine sauce is super lightso that you\\'re really tasting all of these ingredients at their best. It\\'s a lighter take than the fish and grits and I love both! \\n- Caesar salad with crispy chicken added - you guys. The fried chicken here is amazing but, maybe strangely, we love getting it as an addition to their Caesar salad. The chicken is crispy, juicy, and flavorful really pairs well with the simplicity of their salad. It was an extremely pleasant surprise that the chicken that came out with the salad was their fried chicken! Definitely recommend this - or get the fried chicken in ANY of the dishes, really. It comes with the chicken and toast (chicken and granola french toast) or in a rice bowl for lunch or as it\\'s own entree for dinner. Do it!\\n* They always have some sort of cider available (often, they actually have 3 available on the menu)!\\n\\nOne thing that isn\\'t on the menu anymore but that I REALLY hope \"comes back\" (harhar) is the Comeback Cauliflower. It was such a great appetizer/side to get with a meal or even just as something to snack on when getting drinks. The flavor is amazing. Peaches S&C - BRING IT BAAAACK! ;)\\n\\nBy the way, one of my favorite things about Peaches Shrimp & Crab (besides the fact that their food is awesome and it\\'s down the street from where I live) is that they have outdoor seating in FRONT of the restaurant. Not something that\\'s easy to find in this neighborhood but it allows me to bring my dog with me! On nice days, I bring my pup and sit with her out there, where she and I can people-watch and relax after a walk. They always bring her a bowl of water and tell her how cute she is, too.\\n\\nSpeaking of the staff, literally everyone who works here is so nice!\\n\\nOh and I saw that they accept delivery orders through the Caviar app.', u\"This place here. Man listen if you're looking for good food with good selection this is the place. On numerous occasions have been to peaches shrimp and crab for lunch and dinner there's never been an instance of me having to wait an exorbitant amount of time nor anything on the menu not being there so if you see it on the menu you know it's there and you know it's good. Even when I order from home I have had no issues with the order. So I'm giving this business five stars because this place is an excellent restaurant and it delivery is on point. The one thing I hate about a lot of restaurants especially in our area is they tend to run out of items and at no point in time since I've been going to Peaches have they ran out of anything.\", u'I decided to come here for lunch with an old friend.  We shared fried green tomatoes as an appetizer. They tasted delicious..we were both newbies. \\nWe arrived around noon. It was super quiet.  \\nMy friend got the hot house chicken sandwich and u had the whiting \\nLol funny thing is we both spent time eating all our fries. The fries come with old bay seasoning and are fried just right. Simply delicious #noketchupneeded by the way \\nSo my whiting sandwich was so good. Light flaky non greasy.  It comes with 4 large pieces of whiting.  I ate half of the sandwich and the other is for dinner later tomorrow.  \\nPlease check this place out', u'I had a business project in Clinton Hill on Friday. I was supposed to meet someone at 12:00 but he calls and says \"can we move it to 1:00?\". Keep in mind that this project includes a big favor for this guy.\\n\\nI\\'ll get back to this jerk later.  OK might as well have lunch. So I come across this little cafe and the maitre\\' d comes outside and entices me to come in for lunch, ala Little Italy.\\n\\nI\\'m in and ready to order. The Tiger Shrimp Rice Bowl sounds good so that\\'s my order.\\n\\nLunch comes pretty quickly which is always worth a star for me. And the shrimp were good size, I would say jumbo or 16-18\\'s.\\n\\nI finish, ask for my check and I\\'m off. This is the kind of place I like. Good food, good service, and a nice atmosphere. I would have hung around for a drink but I did have that 1:00 appointment, which BTW, the jerk doesn\\'t show up for. Instead I meet the property owner and finish this deal in quick order.\\n\\nOh remember this was going to be a favor, SURE.\\n\\nWell at least I found a great place to eat and if I\\'m back in Clinton Hill I\\'ll eat there again. If you\\'re there too I\\'ll have that drink and I\\'ll buy one for you too.', u'Love love love this place. The restaurant is a great size and the outdoor seating is absolutely perfect when the weather is right. The menu has a great amount of selections and the wine/alcohol menu is perfect. I loved all the wines from Spain. My food was amazing. I ordered the jumbo shrimp broiler and was not disappointed. The lobster/crab mashed potatoes was the best part. And as an Alabama girl I tried the wings with the Alabama drizzle. I would highly recommend them. Overall a lovely spot that I will definitely visit again.', u'Great Food, fast service and nice atmosphere.\\nWill be back for sure, the best Peaches in the chain....', u'Food is great, drinks are great, waitress Ingrid is awesome, and bartenders are good. The problem, then? A man was delivering my meal and made the snide comment everyone hopes they don\\'t hear at a seafood restaurant: \"oh, red wine?\". 1st- f* off. Fortunately I\\'m confident I know what flavors I want in my mouth more than you and 2. Come on. Are you a somm? No. Are you even my bartender? No. This is not a pretentious place, but that guy certainly needed his moment.\\nIt sucked. \\nShrimp and grits- great.', u\"First time here and I was very pleased. Came here for birthday lunch for my mother. We were greeted and seated promptly. They also have high chairs if you are bringing a little one. We ordered the fried chicken and toast, crab spaghetti and the salmon rice bowl. Everyone enjoyed their meals. I can't wait to come back again and try other dishes, especially for brunch.\", u\"Peaches does it again! One of the best brunches in Brooklyn, hands down.\\n\\nI'm a huge fan of B+C restaurant group. Sadly, I never had a chance to have the famed brunch at Marietta before they rechristened themselves Peaches Shrimp and Crab. C'est la vie.\\n\\nShrimp and Crab does a lot of things that other B+C restaurants are known for. They have delicious fried chicken and French toast. They have burgers. And of course, they have other southern cuisine like shrimp and grits.\\n\\nWe ate all of those things because we're gluttons. Pro-tip: you can order fried chicken pieces a la carte. The fried chicken was juicy, crispy, and lives up to the Peaches name (though I do like HotHouse's more).\\n\\nThe Marietta burger is equally wonderful. Served with American cheese and onions, with an extra smoky twang.\\n\\nThe shrimp and grits, with tiger shrimp, kale, mushrooms and hot red chilis was super well balanced, and portion sizes were great (I counted 5 shrimp). Loved every bite.\\n\\nThey also serve various (and unique) cocktails at brunch. The Brownstone Punch was coconutty and pineapple-y and rummy. Also had a regular Bloody Mary (not listed on the menu), which was pretty good. Tons of horseradish, the way it's supposed to be.\\n\\nService was perfect, the space is huge, and most importantly, the food is just wonderful.\", u'Simply came for dessert and drinks I  got the warm butter cake topped with peaches and a side of ice cream. It was alright the cake was not what I anticipated. However the brownstone punch was amazing. Must have if you come here. Service was excellent seated and served immediately', u'This is a good spot to come eat or have a drink they have huge windows to sit in front of and an amazing selection of southern style food with a hint of brooklyn style cuisine\\n\\nHighly recommended', u\"I was really disappointed here, I'm sorry to say. There's few things that I ever leave less than 3 stars but cleanliness is one of them. We came right when the place opened for brunch on a Saturday after reading great things. The first table we were placed at, next to the windows in front, smelled like old seafood. I get it, seafood restaurants smell a little salty, but this was gross. I looked over on the windowsill to find pieces of old crab meat littering the sill, plus caked on grime and some hair. It had obviously not been cleaned in weeks and makes me wonder what else in the place is being overlooked. \\n\\nWe moved tables and ordered breakfast which was tasty. The crab cake was excellent, but I was disappointed in the lox and whitefish platter. The lox had obviously just been removed from a package and placed on the plate. I'm sure the other food is pretty good but I was already grossed out from the place being dirty. I won't be trying it again.\"], u'5.Atrium Dumbo': [u\"This place could have been the whole package: gorgeous venue, excellent location, delicious food and drinks... But the service was really so disappointing that I had to knock off a whole star for this review. Nevertheless, this place is still worth a trek for the food alone.\\n\\nWe came here for a birthday dinner with a table of 9. Yes, that made bill splitting a bit of a nightmare, but we were all happy to tip graciously and we were respectful of the waitstaff. The waitstaff, however, was not happy with that and a friend noticed visible hostility when she asked that our bills be split. We all ordered drinks and a few appetizers. Granted, it was a Saturday night and the place was packed, but the first drink order took an inordinately long amount of time. The second drink order we had to place TWICE mid-meal ended up coming to us all the way at the end with dessert. Then, when I asked for a birthday dessert to be brought out with a candle, it took about 3 different tries to make it clear who the birthday girl was. I didn't think I was being unclear but apparently so.\\n\\nNow that the bad is out of the way, on to the good: MY GOD, THAT FOOD IS DELICIOUS. We ordered the baked bread, which was warm and came with the softest butter I have ever had in my life. Excellent. Then my friend and I shared the tuna tartare - the avocado mousse was a perfect bed for the tuna tartare and the ginger and soy vinaigrette was impeccably paired. Then, we shared the chicken for two - tender, tender chicken plated with the crispiest potato wedges and a delicious dill creme fraiche. That dish came with the butteriest and most decadently rich pot pies I've had in a long while. We were stuffed to the gills. We also ordered the Turkish Rose and what a combination. Gin, Vermouth, black cherry, Bergamot is a heady mix, and boy, was it good. I could have done with the huge amount of crushed ice, but it was refreshing on a humid summer night.\\n\\nAside from the blips from the service, overall I had a great time here and would highly recommend this place, maybe for brunch or on a weeknight when it's not as packed.\", u'We live in Dumbo and eat in the neighborhood often. They may have the best dish in Dumbo right now in the Coq Au Vin, amazing.  \\n\\nService / vibe was strong', u'At first impressions you could sense that the intentions and will from the well pedigreed\\xa0 ownership were genuinely well meant, trying \\xa0hard to be on the right track, but unfortunately  failed clumsily in running an optimum food and service smooth operation.\\n\\nSimple instances regarding waiting over 30 minutes for appetizers, an hour for entrees,  grasping basic meat temperatures accuracy or food quality control like finding foreign pieces of plastic in your meal would equate to very mediocre amateurism, that after a few years in business, this place didn\\'t seem to have resolved.\\n\\nFrazzled careless uncommitted sloppy staff was goofely and comically incompetent in the art of service. Particularly in projecting a composed professional image, without consideration about customers surroundings and space.\\n\\nKafkaesque circus acts, ring mastered by an aloof pretentious Maitre D, were unpalatably performed by a bartender on the verge of a nervous breakdown, slamming a check presenter on the counter, another brute one breaking glasses and plates, an obnoxious senior manager pleasuring  himself at chastising abusively  colleagues, rookie cooks dropping \"F\" bombs in the open kitchen and for the dropped mic crowned jeweled main attraction, the\\xa0owner inappropriately close sniffing like a hound in heat, one of his managers, as if he had BO. All hilariously showcased in full view and earshot of a stoic clientele audience... \\n\\nA myriad of service mistakes were recurrent,  like keeping your water glass full throughout your dinner, utensils for soup or pasta, tiny expresso spoons used for cappuccinos, a knife for a steak, seemed like a difficult daunting task to adjust accordingly, by their poorly trained disheveled frantic servers,  who were constantly running around aimlessly.\\n\\nFood and service had a label of casual fine dining, if you would describe it for the Brooklyn location, but were  no match compared to\\xa0stars rated Manhattan establishments that apply similar prices.\\n\\nRegarding food:\\nRegenetti with pork ragout, inspired by a bolognese preparation was  flavorless lacking the sweetness of sweated onions, caramelized carrots blended with fresh tomatoes, white wine tanginess of micro celeri chunks and herbs that you would expect in that preparation.\\n\\nShrimp Chitarra had good layers of flavors but the soggy noodles bathing in a paddle of cooking water and cheese, pointed to weak cook instincts for timing the subtle Al Dente Italian method of cooking pastas. To their credit the shrimps were fresh, sprinkled with breadcrumbs, nicely cooked with that outer layer lined with charred and pinkish marks and that popping marine flair close to quality Japanese sashimi when biting into them.\\n\\nSeafood entrees were the highlights of their menu, as far as lean simplicity and freshness due to the Provencal /Mediterranean background of their Chef. They were executed with  japanese influence by using table side poured light flavorful clean consomm\\xe9s, dashi broths, but aesthetically abrupt.\\n\\nDuck breast didn\\'t have that \"sous vide\" juicy glossy  pink slow cooked component, even with the unusual clever thick double strips serving cut,  missing the classic protein, starch, legumes, jus that you would expect when ordering pricey duck, leaving you shorthanded and inducing buyer\\'s remorse.\\n\\nDouble cuts Australian lamb chops were pleasurable only because of the high quality of the meat, rightfully frenched the proper way but still with bones looking burnt,  garnishes on this dish were somewhat forgettable with a couple of meager greek diner style bias cut vegetables and an eggplant fritter?\\n\\nWine list was eloquently put together, but didn\\'t translate to $$$ expectations when actually receiving consistent wine service from a well meaning enthusiastic delusional sommelier, mistakenly overwhelmed and way over his head when offering\\xa0$23 Puligny  Montrachet /Gevrey Chambertin glasses of wine in cheap dirty bistro glassware.\\xa0\\n\\nBar relatively efficient with signature cocktails,was manned by bartenders with loud cringy laughs, crumpled\\xa0shirts tucked out. They oozed TGIF 80\\'s era of cocktail shaking cowboy demeanor, straight from the Tom Cruise movie \"Cocktail \", or the Patrick Swayze \"Roadhouse\".\\n\\nAlthough timely produced at an acceptable  cadence, drinks were handled lacking expertise, finesse and buoyancy that you would find in  any respectable civilized craft cocktail bar in the City at the same price points.\\n\\nThis place could be definitely described as a step above a Disneyland French Hard Rock Cafe tourists trap with suspicious cleanliness, with all what it implies. It was intentionally set for masking shortcomings catered to a na\\xefve clientele with low expectations, pretending otherwise would be misleading...', u'One of my recent scouts of the area. Checking their breakfast options through photos, I was not smart enough to call before going on a weekday but be advised that breakfast menu for weekends only. \\n\\nI took the bus B25 after getting off at Dekalb, 15 min bus ride only. They have about 10 tables outside most of which are for 2. Interior section seemed fancy but on a nice autumn day, better to stay out and enjoy the view.\\n\\nEven though they do not offer breakfast, they have nice salads and sandwiches so I ordered avocado crostini and chicken club for my friend. Both were really nice and filling for the reasonable price. Main course prices are so affordable.\\n\\nThey have cappuccino on menu but no latte. I ordered one, first serving was a full cup, second one was half a cup. $4.5 each. Attentive service. \\n\\nP.S. I forgot my credit card and realized it 7-8 hours later, when I called they said they had it and kept for me until I pick it up the next day, kind of them, thank you.', u\"Walked in on a Sunday shortly after they opened at 11am. I was alone and they didn't want to seat me at a table without a reservation. I didn't want to sit at the bar so the hostess let me sit at a table. It wasn't too loud and they had some nice music playing in the background. I had the  smoked salmon crostini. All the crostinis looked pretty good! Also got the crispy potato wedges which were crispy but not too dry. Friendly staff and quick service!\\n\\nPS. Extra props to the water guy! As someone who drinks a ton of water I'm always grateful for someone always refilling my tiny glass.\", u\"We were trying to go to a new nearby brunch spot, but was told that they weren't open yet, so headed to Atrium! There were 4 of us, but the next OpenTable reservation availability for a table of 4 wasn't until much later in the afternoon, so we just did two 2 top reservations and they graciously accommodated us!\\n\\nBrunch was fantastic. Our friends each ordered the chicken and waffles, hubs got a burger with a side of sunny side up egg which he promptly slid onto his burger, and I had a Cobb salad with shrimp. \\n\\nI am not a salad girl. I'm normally ordering double fried everything with a side of extra crispy fries! But this Cobb salad was probably the best salad I've ever had!! The shrimp was cooked to perfection. It was delicious! And I didn't feel deprived!\\n\\nHubs also really liked their screwdrivers - made with fresh squeezed OJ! My mimosa was also delicious - not too sweet with blood orange juice. \\n\\nWe lingered over espresso and their donuts (it was POURING out), and I loved that they didn't rush us out!\", u\"This place is great. It is legit the in between of casual and fancy with great decor and ambience not to mention a great location by the water. The kitchen is also open (not sure what the proper term is) so you can see the food getting prepared and plated which is pretty awesome. You'll see that each dish is prepared individually with care. \\n\\nI came here on a Wednesday night with an 0830 reservation. After a run in dumbo, I was starving so it was fortunate that they were able to seat us half an hour early via walk in. \\n\\nWe had the steak tartare and the burger (medium), both of which I thought was amazing based on my appetite. The steak tartare actually came with a toasted slice of bread. It probably would have been  a good idea to eat it without as the burger itself had enough bread and it also came with delicious potato wedges and the steak tartare itself was very flavorful and just melted in my mouth. The bread that came with the burger was so soft and fluffy but also stayed together which made me enjoy the burger that much more. \\n\\nUnfortunately I couldn't make room in my stomach for the donuts. I guess there will be a next time.\", u\"A couple of friends and I decided to do brunch here because we didn't feel like dealing with a long wait for a table and they had an opening for a reservation. There was a short line out the door, but we were quickly seated upstairs after arriving. It's a pretty large space and the decor matches the neighborhood, hip and inviting. Service was quick and friendly, given our space to browse the menu and also while we were eating; we didn't feel rushed at all. As for the food, no complaints from presentation to taste. We ordered the biscuits to share, which came with butter and jam. Their biscuits were nice and fluffy on the inside, but the outside could've been more flakey. It went perfectly with the jam and was fine w/out the butter. \\n\\nThere aren't a lot of options on the menu and hopefully that would mean quality over quantity. That being said, we ordered the scrambled eggs, the omelette and eggs florentine. The eggs were cooked just right in all those forms and whether with bread or greens, it was surprisingly filling. I guess it's the area so it's a bit on the pricey side for what it is, comparable to popular brunch places in Manhattan. If you're in the area, it's a good option though. It's a nice place to enjoy a meal and catch up with friends. I wouldn't mind coming back when in DUMBO, but a reservation is probably still a good idea!\", u'If you find yourself in the DUMBO area of Brooklyn, you MUST check out the Atrium restaurant. This place is BEAUTIFUL! Everything about this place was 5 stars! \\n\\nFood: I had a steak that was to die for! It was cooked to perfection and I had a delicious smooth whiskey to wash it down with! The whiskey came recommend by our waiter and I must say he made the right call!\\n\\nService: The service was TOP NOTCH! You never felt like the wait staff was hovering over you but you also never felt like they were neglecting you! Our waiter always came right on time like a mind reader and made great recommendations from entrees to drinks! He was delightful and truly made our experience here that much better! \\n\\nThis restaurant is pretty pricey but I can honestly say you get what you pay for here! I will definitely be back here for a romantic dinner for two with my girlfriend for her birthday! 5 Stars all around for this place', u\"Decent spot for brunch. Certainly busy, but no prohibitive waiting. We didn't have a resi and were able to walk in around 12:30pm and get seated at a shared table (e.g. we were 2 seats of 6). I ordered the avo egg crostini and it was soooo good! Honestly was kind of bummed I had to share with the bf. We also ordered the fried chicken and waffles (which comes with bacon and a poached egg). I thought it was decent/ok. Chicken was really tender and bacon was great, egg perfectly poached, but I felt like I wanted some syrup or something spicy to give it a little more flavor/punch.\", u\"Presentation to food was on point!\\n\\nOrdered two starters & two entrees. Everything was good! The beef tartare was a bit salty for me so be sure to eat it with the bread it comes with. \\n\\nExtensive wine and whiskey menu if you're into that. Even though the waitress didn't know too much about the whiskey, she gracefully brought over the assumed to be floor manager or general manager. \\n\\nGreat for dates or a special event. Try to make reservations to avoid wait times.\", u\"Just finished eating here last night. I haven't eat red meat for a year and half, trying to go vegan. Ordered the Cavatelli and asked the waiter if there is meat in it cos I want to order vegetarian. The answer was no. When I got my food I started to eat, then I was shocked to find fried bacon in the dish.  I asked another waiter who then called the manager who then came over turned on his cell phone light and put it in my face as he checked the dish and then abruptly without warning grabbed my plate and left.  I was told to wait for a new dish. This left my date with his entree (to either let go cold or for him to eat alone) and nothing for me but an asparagus side and no plate.  \\n\\nLater on they apologized and brought me a new dish without meat but by that time I had already lost my appetite.  \\n\\nThey could have offered to take my boyfriends dish in to keep warm or made some other accommodation so we could eat together but it seemed that they were just happy to get ready to close up.  The waiter was very friendly and so were all the staff except the host/maitre'd who seemed aloof or distant to us.   The food was good, the experience not so much.\", u'Was able to snag one of the prized sidewalk tables last night.. heck yes for great views of the park and general saturday night bk bridge bustle.  kicked things off with a glass of their rose- dry, no sweetness, smooth- really stinking good. ordered their gouda bread appetizer (served warm and soft with salted butter) which was of course delicious. then sampled the regenetti pasta with pork ragout and kale as well as the cavatelli with pancetta and peas. We ordered the appetizer portions for both pastas and the portions were super generous. Was my first time trying regenetti pasta and, boy oh boy, was this dish fantastic with perfect proportions of meat to veg and pasta... highly recommend.\\n\\nThe prices are definitely a little steep, but the meal and drinks, as well as the venue are well worth the splurge.', u'Had an amazing time here years ago during a Yelp elite event. Spacious, industrial but green decor featuring dim lights, high ceilings  and a captivating vertical garden. Great place for group celebrations.\\n\\nMy 2nd encounter here occurred on a week night. We were one of the last people who came in to dine. Same fun and intimate ambiance. Started out with their cocktail list, ordered the Tea and Kalamasi (sweet bourbon based cocktail) and my husband got the special of the night, a refreshing drink similar to the cucumber & Agave. Really enjoyed my drink, not too sweet or too tart, refreshing but leaves an impact.\\n\\nOn to food. The pie mussels that we shared as an app had a good sauce. Few of the mussels weren\\'t that fresh. Medium size. We then ordered the Wild stripped bass and Long island duck. The bass was alright but came with pretty much no sides \"endives and emulsion\". The duck was not much to talk about either. Upon review, we should have went with the organic chicken. \\n\\nService was very professional. Our waitress kept checking in on us frequently.\\n\\nOverall, great place to come for an app or drink. Great mixologist. Would certainly return knowing their wine list has won awards.....Hit or miss for dinner.  For the prices they charge, that\\'s not a risk I\\'d take again. \\n\\nAtmosphere 5 stars\\nService 4 stars\\nCocktails 4 stars\\nFood 3 stars', u\"Before coming to New York, I searched for recommendations on places to eat and Atrium Dumbo popped up. I read a lot of great reviews about this place so I decided to give it a try. I came here on a Monday night, around 7pm and it was pretty busy. We were told that we could not get a table without a reservation unless we wanted to sit at the bar area. My friend and I didn't mind so we ended up sitting at the bar area anyways. It would have been nice to know about making a reservation in advance though. \\n\\nEverything on the menu was a bit on the pricey side. The  main course portions were pretty small, didn't really fill me up. I had the squid ink crab pasta while my friend had the wild boar pasta. The squid ink crab pasta tasted like any other regular pasta to me tbh. It was plain pasta, with crab, cheese, and chili peppers. There were some items that other helpers recommended people to try but when I asked the server about it, they said those items have been taken off the menu. It's just disappointing to see something that catches your eye only to find out that they no longer serve the dish. The portions and the pricing was definitely not worth it. I mean it was good, service was good, but would I pay $28 for pasta again? Probably not. It was a cool experience though since the location of this restaurant is right by the Brooklyn bridge. Stunning view.\", u'Beautiful place and busy as can be.  \\n\\nFood seemed inspired and drinks were well made.   The chefs seems young but confident and people were frequently turned away.  \\n\\nI walked in and asked for an opening.   45 minutes or bar were the options, so I opted for bar.   Pasta was great and  would go back for more.  \\n\\nUnfortunately they seemed rather busy and politely unaccommodating.   I witness some patrons getting air kisses while others just told no seating ready and at least two groups told the outdoor tables (which were empty) were closed by 9 pm so they could not eat there.\\n\\nHad to wait quite some time for the food and though a table opened up in the dining area, none of the bar patrons were offered to move over.   \\n\\nPerhaps it was just busy but it felt a little like they knew they were one of the only games in town.  Great food but could be friendlier in how they treat their guests.', u'HORRIBLE experience. Order the salmon crudo at. your. own. risk. Dined with friends on a weeknight and was dissatisfied with the food and service. I love seafood but had food poisoning from the salmon (which may have been less than fresh). The dish was pretty but as we all know, looks can be deceiving. Service was slooow and the atmosphere was chaotic with servers/managers dashing around the place. One star for the creative drink menu and brownie points for the location/views (for outdoor seating). Would NOT return. Seems there are other nearby spots in DUMBO with equally scenic views.', u\"Came across this spot while killing time waiting to meet a friend for dinner in the neighborhood. Ordered the Grapefruit Collins. YUM! I love grapefruit, but hate sugary drinks. This was perfectly balanced. Staff was friendly and welcoming. \\n\\nMy friend was running late, and I was starving so the bartender suggested the Beef tartare. Literally the BEST tartare I've ever had. Pretty sad I had to share when my friend finally showed up, haha! \\n\\nWe had planned on dining elsewhere, but wanted to stay because everything I'd ordered was so amazing, but didn't have reservations. The host worked very hard to accommodate us and we sat in the super cute outside area. \\n\\nWe shared the Australian Rack of Lamb and the Smoked Long Island Duck with Caramelized Banana and Toffee for dessert. The wine selection was pretty epic, and they were super knowledgeable and spot on with helping us choose! At the top of my list as far as dining experiences go, can't wait to come back!\", u'Atrium is a great place for brunch! The chicken and waffles was some of the best I have ever had. Tip: MAKE A RESERVATION! It gets really crowded and you pretty much need a reservation to eat here for brunch. I was lucky enough last time I came to grab a seat at the counter downstairs; however, I would suggest making a reservation to be safe! The staff was very friendly, constantly checked in with us to make sure everything was okay, and were very attentive in refilling our waters and coffees.', u\"The wait would have been extremely long. Recommend going on open table and making reservation beforehand. Luckily we were able to find a seat in the bar area which was first come, first serve. \\n\\nThere was only one bathroom (maybe someone was taking way too long in the other one?). Waited at least 15 minutes in line to go to the bathroom. Came back to my high top table and food still didn't arrive yet. Pretty sure we waited at least 30 minutes just for our food to arrive. It was just so packed. \\n\\nI will give super kudos to the host. He was greeting customers, cleaning up tables, kicking out people from the bathroom line that weren't dining there, checked the bathroom to see if it was clean, etc. He was doing so many things at once and still keeping his cool. \\n\\nI ordered the salmon crostini and the soup of the say (mushroom bisque). Both were really good but I'm not sure if it was worth the wait to get the table, waiting for them to clean or table, and waiting for the food to get there. Idk, just seems they can't handle the rush of customers.\"], u'123.Claro': [u\"It's refreshing to see new concepts like this come up that are a little different - and can also appeal by being interesting. \\n\\nThe place is nice, the outdoor area is spacious and comes with a view of the grill & tortilla making oven? Which is cool.\\n\\nThe dishes were inspired and the menu is cool; more affordable than initially thought it would be as you can definetly be good with 3 items for 2 ppl ( they say 3-5 is ok). Cocktail list is also primo- mine was just ok but that's probably just my flavor profile. \\n\\nBest dish was the steak tlya something - amazing, would go back just for that again- ++ service was good.\", u\"Sat at the bar outside where two women took charge of the grill and prepared fresh Memelas and Tlayudas with corn imported from Oaxaca. When I visited they were two weeks new. Staff: well trained/knowledgeable. Focused menu: 15 savory/1 sweet/7 cocktails/6 beers. \\n\\nKing Salmon Crudo/Cherry Chimoy/Peanuts/Herbs: Creative and well thought out dish. The cherry came right through, although the sweetness drowned the jalapeno and cilantro flavor as well as any acid. Felt it needed more salt/acid. \\n\\nSteak Tlayuda was a little bland on the first bite but on the second and third, the flavors pulled through more cohesively. I asked for hot sauce which helped bring acid and salt to the dish. The steak could have been cut thinner or cubed. The steak was clumpy and large for me to enjoy biting into. The crispiness of the Tlayuda reminded me of burnt Matzah - the only part of Passover I enjoyed as a child. \\n\\nChorizo Memela with potato and quesillo. The Memela, no doubt, is delicious and was the star of the dish. Although I was hoping the chorizo and chees would make this a more complete dish. \\n\\nOverall the food was really well thought out and good, but I wished the chefs were a bit more aggressive with their seasoning. None of my dishes were a knockout or consistent with the flavors and they certainly can be. \\n\\nService rec: I would put the phone ringer on a lower volume. No one seems to pick it up behind the bar so might as well shut it off as it's loud and intrusive to dining. Especially when there's no music in the patio area.\", u'Great place. Food is like no place else. Truly authentic Mexican. We loved it.\\nWatching them cook outside was very interesting and entertaining. So many different things to travel. We ordered and shared at the table. Great way to do it.\\nThe drinks are also very good.\\n\\nHighly recommend this place.\\nThey have outside seating.', u\"What a treat to try a restaurant in our hood on day 2! \\n\\nClaro is a solid 4.25. It was great to see the place packed on a rainy end of summer weekend but didn't have to wait more than 20-25 minutes for a table for two. The restaurant is beautifully designed and feels cozy without being so dark you need to pull out your cell phone light to read the menu. The chairs are a cushioned folding variety that are more comfortable than they sound, but can pinch you if you move them the wrong way.\\n\\nStarting with cocktails you'd expect a ton of Mezcal based drinks since one of the owners also owns El Buho. I prefer my agave in the tequila variety, so went for the Vi Roja which was very balanced and had one of those nice giant single cubes in it. My wife went for the sweeter side and chose a Don Ron - a spectacular flavorful drink that was perfect for end of summer. \\n\\nThe food just comes out as it's done, so we ordered a bunch of things that were a mix between appetizer size & entree size. They were very accommodating with food allergies and left nuts off where requested (and I'm still alive). \\n\\nFirst came the Memela - which was like a little heavenly pizza. Not what my wife was expecting when thinking of heirloom tomatoes, but still superb. The homemade tortilla it came on was perfection. This was gone in 3 seconds flat. \\n\\nThen came the King Salmon Crudo (sans nuts). We had ordered some rice on the side (it was just plain white rice for $7.. not worth it) but when you mixed up the crudo and dropped a little rice in there it was a bowl for the gods. I don't even like salmon too much, but this was super yum. \\n\\nThe Quesadilla came next and wrapping that tortilla around anything is... I mean.. yummmy. The chard/mushroom/goat chees really made it a star quesadilla and had great flavors overall.\\n\\nWe rounded out the plates with the Tlayuda. By this point my wife was almost full, but had to try it as I loved the flavors even if it was a bit messy to eat (glad it wasn't a date). They suggest just diving in with a knife and fork, which is the correct way to eat this treat. \\n\\nTo close out we went with a dessert option that was off menu - a chocolate mouse. It tasted more like a gelato but satisfied the sweet craving without being memorable. \\n\\nUnfortunately it was raining and we didn't get to check out the back yard, which looked like a great option. I did peek into the open air outdoor kitchen where the chef was hard at work and creating some amazing smells. Note the amazing clay pieces that they use for all of their dishes - really helps create the authentic atmosphere. \\n\\nNice pluses like having my napkin folded when going to the restroom and never having to ask for a water refill certainly gives them a service thumbs up - definitely pros. While I'm not giving top stars (which places I MUST go back to frequently get) it's above 4 stars no doubt. It's great having new & genuine places come to the hood and it's a welcome addition to have this Oaxacan gem.\", u\"Let me start by saying I'm usually not a huge fan of Mexican food restaurants. Usually the most I can do is tacos at a truck or store. But Claro really unveiled some new concepts. For one, their style of cooking is great. They have an outdoor area where they cook (make tortillas and have a grill) as well as your traditional indoor kitchen. The patio is also really nice for outdoor seating. \\nI started off with the Lobster tostado and the vegetable tlyadu which were both incredible. Also got the chorizo memelo which was good but nothing great. Ask for the dessert! It is not on the menu. It is like a pot de creme with Mexican hot chocolate and berries and mints. OVerall great experience.\", u\"It was a pleasure to watch this 3 day old restaurant operate with such precision.  From the hostess on through the waitress, bartenders, multiple chefs and bus staff nothing could be improved on. \\nDrink orders were taken and filled promptly. The food was unique and flavorful. We ordered 5 entrees for 4 and shared to everyone's delight.  The food came out at the ideal pace. \\nI have a gluten problem and have never had such an outstanding selection as Claro's. The quesadilla with Swiss chard, wild mushrooms and goat cheese was a big favorite as was the Tlayuda, a rabbit dish. \\n\\nThe drink menu was diverse with all the standards and many Mexican concoctions.  \\n\\nPricing for such high quality, tasty food was bargain.\", u\"Didn't love my meal here. The highlight was definitely the Barbacoa. Everything was entirely forgettable from the Tlayuda to Tetela to the Lobster Crudo. And I found the shrimp aguachile to be just off putting. We all felt the place was a little off. They have this beautiful outdoor cooking situation but they hadn't really seemed to figure it out yet. I was even more surprised to hear this was the same people behind Freek's Mill, as I really enjoyed that place. Drinks were fine, but not running back.\", u'So as you can tell from my profile, I travel all around the New York and New Jersey area eating food of all varieties and backgrounds.  Last week I was lucky enough to visit Claro in Brooklyn and I  absolutely fell in love with the food and atmosphere of this new establishment.  I usually only write Yelp reviews about places that I don\\'t like, or really want to see do well, and Claro is one of those places that I want to see stick around for a long time.  I have not come across traditional Mexican food from the Oaxaca area very often in my travels but I was so pleasantly surprised to see an abundance of traditional ingredients and techniques incorporated into the many different dishes on the menu. \\n\\nThe staff was friendly and professional, even for a restaurant that only opened a week or two ago from what I understand.  Every time I got up from my seat to use the restroom or take a look at the kitchen or outdoor space they have, I was greeted with a folded napkin when I returned.  My glass of water was never empty and we got our food and drinks faster than I had even anticipated.  The restaurant had character and charm and it seemed like they had already hit a nice flow which is not what you expect from the new option in the hood.  \\n\\nI was waiting for my friends to arrive at the bar and asked the bar tender to whip me up a cocktail of his discretion.  He offered up a variety of a \"smokey manhatten\" that was absolutely delicious.  They had a huge variety of mezcal and tequila, along with the usual offerings of traditional spirits.  Our cocktails were all delicious and I wished I had taken pics of the food and drinks but we had such a nice time and enjoyed everything so much I didn\\'t even think about pulling my phone out to snap a couple of pics.  \\n\\nThe outdoor cooking and dining area was probably the coolest part about our experience at Claro.  The chefs were hard at work outside and also inside and everything was so fun to watch happen and then get to enjoy at our table.  We had a variety of selections like the shrimp ceviche, the steak, the rabbit and slew of other delights.  I really enjoyed everything we had over the course of the evening.  \\n\\nI can\\'t say enough about how enjoyable our experience was and how much we enjoyed the atmosphere of Claro.  I will definitely return soon to try the dishes we missed and also for the Goat which had already sold out when we arrived towards the later part of the evening.  We eagerly anticipate our return to Claro and hope everyone gives this place a shot.', u'This place is a joke of a restaurant. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. Sat there for 20 mins after our run and were sitting on a bench with 2 of our beers with 4 open tables. Maybe because we were in our work out attire? It\\'s not like this place is $$$ for me to be walking in my jimmy choos..? Real shame some read good things about the head chef. Will not returns, even for the \"sold out\" mole.', u\"Very good spot with amazing food, super friendly staff and great atmosphere in. Chris helped us a lot because we were first time in Mexican restaurant and didn't know what to order. All was on top!\", u'Loved the ambiance , food and service.  Special shout-out to the bartender Andrew- cocktails on point! We loved the goat cheese quesadilla, Lobster Tostada (heaven on earth), and  the salmon ceviche.  love the outdoor patio!', u\"We expected a few bumps on its first weekend but the good and service were perfect. The drinks are fabulous and the food crave-worthy. I'd give them five stars but then where do you go from there? I expect it will be crazy crowded once the word gets out.\", u\"Claro is a must go! If you're looking for a unique dinning experience it's worth the venture to this new jem on 3rd ave in Brooklyn! Start your night with some delicious cocktails in the string light lit back yard and watch the chefs do their thing while the smell of the wood fire from the comal make you feel at home. Move on inside for a culinary experience! I suggest sharing so you can order more and try a bit of everything! The quesadilla is a can't miss as is the goat and the consume! lobster tostada is one thing you're not going to want to share, with fresh corn, big chunks of lobster, and a tomalley aioli! The staff is friendly, the atmosphere is perfect, but the food is what's gonna keep you coming back with all your friends! Go taste for yourself!\", u'The space is great, the tortillas are good, the rest of the food is white dude Mexican food. The mole is ketchup, the meat is--hey the place just opened so hopefully they figure their deal out.', u\"We went there a couple of days before they officially opened. The staff were lovely, and eager to hear what we thought. We ordered the salmon crudo with cherries and peanuts. Such an unusual combo and yet pretty perfect in terms of flavors and variety of textures. That was my favorite part. We also had the goat cheese and mushroom quesadilla, which was yummy, made with heirloom corn they grind themselves. Very rustic and different. The last main we had was a chicken with mole. I thought it was just fine but my fella gave it a thumbs-up. We also had a delicious chocolate pudding with cream that made me want to lick the bowl. I had a blackberry cocktail with a very smokey salt rim that was delicious. We'll certainly be back.\"], u'63.Big Tiny': [u'Wow!!! My husband and I just loved our first visit to Big Tiny. We\\'re worried the next time we try to come it will be too busy. \\nBig Tiny is an adorable, cozy French wine bar with amazing food! I can\\'t believe this used to be the old video rental store. Its unrecognizable. \\nWe met here after work for dinner. We drank glasses of red wine so we could try different things and have some fun! He had a cab franc/malbec and I asked about something \"earthy\" and the owner thought for a moment and then suggested a Spanish wine not on the menu. It was very earthy and delicious and exactly what we asked for! For my next glass, I then asked for any other suggestions and ended up with a Spanish Grenache after getting to try 2 different choices. We loved this!\\nWhen you sit down you get a delicious complimentary olive tapenade and we ordered 3 small bites: scallop carpaccio, filet mignon carpaccio and escargot and 1 large bite: cassoulet. Everything was absolutely delicious! \\nThe owner also gave us a small pour each of a sparkling German cider after our meal. \\nThis was the best meal and overall experience we\\'ve had anywhere in the neighborhood anytime recently! \\nPrices were less than I would have expected.\\nI can\\'t imagine this place will remain the same. It\\'s too good and affordable right now. Please no one come and blow up our spot!!!', u\"Intimate little wine bar with small plates to share. The wine list focuses on natural wine so if you like them/are curious to try them, there's a good selection to sample here and are reasonable priced. The waiter will also offer recommendations and give you a tasting to find the perfect glass! We had a chilled syrah and two different natural sauvignon blanc -- both were so different than traditional wines and are worth trying. You also get a delicious tapenade and toasted bread with your drinks. The drinks list include beer and sake as well, if that's more your thing.\\n\\nFood is decent but will likely just come back to sample more from the wine list -- as they've just opened, it seems like they're still getting tons of new shipments so there's always something new to check out. Seating is tight, I'd recommended coming here for dates or a group of 4 at the maximum.\", u\"Great new place--small but cozy! \\n\\nFrom the owners of Jolie Cantina. Solid small plates and good wine selection. We even got a few extra glasses of booze on the house because they'd just recently opened! \\n\\nWill definitely be back!!\", u'Really enjoyed my first outing to Big Tiny, I say first because there will be many subsequent visits in my future. First off, I really enjoy wine bars and saw this one pop up as something new in Brooklyn. The place itself is really cozy and I loved the decor. We met the owner and he happened to be waiting on us. He made lovely suggestions of wine (and let me taste quite a few before deciding on a glass) and helped with the cheese plate selection. Really enjoyed the complimentary olive taponade. We also ordered the scallop dish ( which was lovely and light), oxtail terrine (interesting dish) and the octopus salad ( really nice flavor). Overall really cute place and will definitely be back to try the other things on the menu.', u'I loved my first visit to Big Tiny! A much anticipated cool French spot with wine, beer, and sake that Smith Street has been sorely needing since Jakewalk closed a few months ago. \\n\\nThe food itself was wonderful- we had the oxtail terrine, steak tartare, scallop carpaccio, and Cornish hen. The drinks were delicious and the atmosphere was just perfect, from the friendly kitchen staff and owner to the lighting, music, and open windows. We will definitely be back and likely adding this to our regular spots.', u\"Probably my favorite wine bar in the neighborhood. I think they open recently but they have their stuff together. They served a lovely complimentary tapenade as a starter. Great date night spot! Highly recommended tou won't be disappointed\", u'Hands down the best wine bar I have been to. The cozy and friendly atmosphere is only surpassed by their outstanding service and unique food and drinks. Get the cold Sake and any of the tar tars! You. Are. Welcome. I will be back on the regular!', u'Great addition to the neighborhood. Been meaning to get here and tried it tonight. Excellent food. Impeccable service from the owner. Fantastic wine and sake. Will be back soon.', u\"Tiny, Beautiful, Fun and Delicious ! Well designed !\\nSmall plates to share with a fine selection of wines.\\nYou want: Quality ? Ambiance ? Well priced ? \\nBig Tiny in Brooklyn is my recommendation.\\nRun don't walk !\", u'I traveled last night from Manhattan to Brooklyn, in the rain, to try this recently opened spot, and I was well rewarded for my efforts.  The selection of delicious, organic wines was amazing, and the food was delicious.  The atmosphere is charming and intimate, the service warm and welcoming, and it makes me feel like moving nearby so I can stop by more often after work.  Do give it a try.  You will be delighted with what you find!', u'Excellent wine selection guided by a clearly knowledgeable and well versed owner. Small plates are distinct and refreshing. Satisfing place to enjoy some chilled reds on a weeknight.', u'Wow! Great food, the escargot was incredible. Tuna tartare was great too. Lovely glasses of wine and a cute spot! Will be back soon'], u'90.Do\\xf1a Zita Mexican Restaurant': [u'Definitley the place to get food in Coney Island beach area. Although they dont serve alcohol they allow alcohol from the Margaritas Restaurant around the corner! Service was very friendly and place is cute and small. Cant believe I have missed this joint! \\n    I ordered a Carnitas tostada which was $5 but holy moly it was loaded with cheese guac tomato and meat. \\n    My husband got the Flautas which are fried rolled tacos he got chicken. Very yummy, service was prompt, clean area, nice music along the patio. \\n    Will definitely come again I really wanted to order the  Cemita but seeing the portions ima wing it and come hungry or hangry lol totally recommend glad I came on mh day of here', u\"Easily the best tacos I've had in the New York area so far. I had a carnitas and chorizo taco with a little of both of the salsas. The meats had flavor and the veggies were fresh. At a price point of $3.50 a taco, it was awesome.\\n\\nDoesn't hurt that it's outside and you can enjoy the sun.\", u\"The food is ok. Some stuff is kind of bland and you'll need to put hot sauce or other condiments on it for taste. It can be 30 minutes or more wait for food and then there are no seats. The music is too loud and annoying.\", u\"I'm usually not the type of person to eat from places are hole in the walls. But when I heard chatter about how good this place was AND they had vegetarian options I was sold. There were 2 separate lines, one for tacos one for everything else. We just got tacos but next time I am getting the enchiladas. All the food is made to order. I ordered 3 veggie tacos and they were HUGE. At authentic Mexican places they normally don't have a veggie option so I was so excited. The tacos were two tortillas, beans, Lettuce, cilantro, cheese, avocado, and tomato. They had salsa and sour cream to dress your own taco with. Will 100% be back!\", u\"Decent Mexican at Coney Island, hallelujah. The cemitas (Mexican sandwiches) seem like the thing to get, but even the tostadas are piled high, with sauces and accompaniments to round things out. There's a separate stall in the vicinity doing Mexican corn. An order of horchata rounds things out perfectamente.\", u'I was thinking of getting a snack, so I got 2 tacos, but they were huge, and SO fresh and delicious! Friendly people good value', u'Went here with a group of 6 people and ordered one of their combo meals. Great value, for around $20 you get loads of rice and meat and other such things (depending on your choices) and a two liter bottle of soda. Food was good, service was quick, and this place probably has the best prices of anywhere near Coney Island!', u\"A little gem amongst the busy area of Coney Island/ Luna park. Hidden on the tiny street of Bowery behind some arcade rooms you'll find some really awesome Mexican food. \\n\\nMy friend and I were in the area lookin for a quick lunch. Aside from Nathan's famous all the other restaurants here have horrendous reviews. It was a surprise to see a little small shop like this one to be so highly rated so we decided to give it a shot. Definitely a great find. \\n\\nWe ordered the carnitas tostadas, carnita tacos, and a quesadilla. Super fresh and huge huge portions!The pile of carnitas was juicy and tender. Large amounts of oaxacan cheese , avocado, and toppings. The great thing was they also have a DIY toppings bar with salsa, hot sauce, and sour cream. The quesadilla was unique as well. Thicker than normally and it was grilled to a crispy cheesy perfection. \\n\\nOverall a decent experience and I would come here again if I'm at Coney Island.\", u'This is real food. We found it by coincidence (covering from the rain), and we really loved it. Cheap (but huge!) portions made to order. We had tostada and quesadilla and will go back to try their tacos. Hidden gem!', u\"Best place for tacos!!!! Always my go to spot and it's super cheap also and huge portions! You can make two tacos out of the one taco you buy. I wish more places gave as much portions as this place does. Very great price and huge tacos! Love it!\", u'Tasty food, and so much of it! Went here seeking any port in a literal storm during the Mermaid Parade. Service was friendly and produced paper plates piled high with delicious Mexican food. There are various cuisine-appropriate condiments by the register, including squeeze bottles of salsa verde and rojas. Make sure to douse your plate--my flautas did not have any salsa other than what I added.', u\"Nothing fancy, just yummy tacos.  I got two vegetarian tacos (beans, lettuce,tomato, avocado and cheese). You can also get mushrooms on it as well.   Hubby got chorizo.  Both were excellent.  Warning: the green and red hot sauces are really hot !  At $3.50 a taco, can't beat it!\", u\"Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had in New York City. Really authentic traditional Mexican street food. Authentic Oaxaca cheese. Fast and friendly service. Delighted.\", u'Big flavor in those tacos. The chicken was a bit dry. Overall three people ate well for $20. No alcohol served so bring your own beer.', u\"Do not underestimate Dona Zita! Before hitting the beach, this is a must especially if you enjoy Mexican food. Their prices may seem a little expensive, but the portions are well worth it. I always get a torta here and I can never finish the whole thing. Their tacos are also equally delicious. It's a great establishment for Coney Island and I can't wait til next summer just to get another one!\", u\"Came to get a torta. The prices a a bit high but it's okay bc your are in Coney Island I would rather pay$10 for sandwhich then $7 for a frozen sauasge on the boardwalk, okay the reason for the low stars. I ordered a torta which is a Mexican sandwhich. I got the breaded steak and to my first surprise the lady Gave me a steak sandwich I told her I ordered breaded steak and she had no problem fixing the mistake. Now here is why the negative stars, my breaded steak sandwhich finally came out but only to be super rubbery and inedible. You can tell that steak was super old so I brought it to the cashier to show her I was u able to bite it. At this point I just wanted a refund. She went to the back room I guess to get the owner to show her. The owner came out and had the audacity to tell me she would only refund me $5 bc she already wasted one sandwhich which wasn't even my fault. It was miscommunication with the order, not me. And I showed her how old the steak looked and smell, she should be ashamed to even offer this to customers. Long story short, terrible service from the owners, this is not how you do buisness.\", u\"Don't waste your time with any of the other food vendors at Coney Island.  The food here is so delicious and not too expensive.  Definitely try the corn on the cob!\", u\"Spoiler alert!: I'm not from CA or TX or any other state that claims to own Mexican food so take what I say with a pinch of salt ... or epazote. \\n\\nTried carnitas, chicken, and spicy pork tacos. Carnitas was overwhelmingly greasy, chicken was bland, and spicy pork tasted like red flavoring. Tacos are $3.50 each. While other reviewers talk of authentic flavors, I found these fairly gringo-style with tons of shredded lettuce. \\n\\nI'm not a huge fan of their open condiment set up -- especially in a place as dirty as Coney Island. One patron had a pension for licking her fingers, while making that where's-my-napkin hand gesture, and then grabbing the communal bottles of salsa. \\n\\nThis place may have been better in the past, but I think the 5-star reviews are unwarranted. This food is not special and I found it lacking in general. I don't regret my lunch, but I don't need to eat there again.\", u\"Glad my gf and I bumped into this place on a Saturday night while strolling through Coney because her and I were starving! We didn't eat much at this place -- in fact, just one taco each -- but from what people were ordering, the volume of guests, and the seemingly popularity of their corn on the cob, this joint is legit. \\n\\nWhat she ordered: carnitas. \\nWhat I ordered: chorizo. \\n\\nI liked my chorizo taco but I wasn't so thrilled. It was tasty, but lacking a punch that I get whenever I eat the chorizo taco from Rockaway Taco. They're alike but different in many ways. Still flavorful but not great. I wish I had gotten to try the carnitas, which looked super ah-mah-zing. I will, however, give this establishment 3 stars because of its popularity, quality food (taken the gf's opinion into account of her carnitas), the outrageously mouth-watering menu, and for the staff's quick hands with the food-handling. \\n\\nI wish there were more seating available but considering it's really a shack that HAPPENS to have enough space for some seating, I won't hold much of a grudge.\", u'TACOS!!!!\\nBestest tacos ever!!!\\nI found this \"spot\" back when it was a little stand in the flea market behind Nathans when I worked at Astroland.in the mid2000s she moved to this spot near El Dorado arcade. The tacos here are sooo fresh and yummy and the Pico de Gallo is TO DIE FOR!!! \\nThey also serve yummy tortas and quesadillas.... dont forget the agua de fruta or jarrito soda!'], u'76.Bunsmith': [u\"I stopped in for a quick beer mostly because there was parking place in front of it.  Lucky move.\\n\\nI can't comment on the food because I didn't have any.  I had one beer, that's all I had time for.\\n\\nWhat I can comment on is the vibe and the staff which is about 95% what I care about.  Everybody sells food and beer so why will I definitely go back?  Nice staff, friendly staff, smiling staff.  Anyone can pour a cold beer but many places don't have the sense to do it smiling.\\n\\nPeople are either charming or tedious and this holds true for people slinging beer.  In this place the people are charming.  Thanks for that!  I'll be back.\", u\"This place is so cute, I just happened to be in the area and looking for a good place to eat. The menu was decent from what I saw on Yelp. Once we got here we were seated right away which was great, the host was nice and someone was with us right away. I already enjoy Korean food very much so the food here was a fun treat. We shared the chicken nuggets and their seafood pancake, we also each had a bun. Everything was good including the service.\\n\\nI can not find a reason to come back, and try a few other items from the menu. I can't wait to go back for another date night or just out with the girls.\", u\"This is my second time at Bunsmith, I loved it the first time but this time I brought a friend - which is always nerve wrecking because you hope your guest will love it as much as you do and that the restaurant hasn't magically gone down hill since the last visit. \\nI am happy to report the second time was great too! Bunsmith has such a great vibe, I love the music they somehow flawless get away with playing 90's R&B, Alternative, 70's and I even heard a 80's Steve Winwood song. Sounds weird but trust me it works. \\nNow the food and drinks - overall it is delicious. As appetizers we shared the artichokes which was topped with a deliciously flavorful garlic aioli. And the sweet chili calamari, also delicious and nicely fried which is so crucial and we added the house made hot sauce - which really isn't hot but it is good. \\nWe both ordered the Bootsy Collins cocktail and it was great. I'm not a big drinker but I do love a nice sweet cocktail and this drink was divine. If you like your drinks on the sweeter side, give this one a try. \\nFor entrees we an assortment of the  Buns - the bulgogi, the sweet and the hot fried chicken and the pork jowl. My fav was the sweet fried chicken. The buns are nice and soft and the filling delicious. \\nWith so many options in NY there aren't many places that I revisit but Bunsmith is now on this very short list and on the top. So, I highly recommend Bunsmith and will be back soon.\", u'This was a cool place, and not just full of tourists like us! Really got the Korean vibe when we went in. Granted looking at the menu again on the website, its kind of obvious, Kimchi starter, hellooooo! \\n\\n    Anyway, really well cooked meat and very very tasty. For Buns we tried the Spicy Korean Fried Chicken (not that spicy) Bulgogi (rib eye beef). Added to it a Pork Jowl bowl and Tofu starter and Kale Salad. We shared this between myself, my wife and her friend. It was enough food for the three of us. It is pricey, you don\\'t get much in each bun, I\\'d suggest the bowls for more bang for your buck. Vegetables are kinda short on the list, so vegans, don\\'t go here! We ordered the bowl with \"zucchini noodles\" which really was sliced zucchini but it was really nice, went well with the combination. Buns are more like sandwiches to me but our friend told us some styles are made like this is Taiwan as well. \\n\\n     This place is half bar, half eat in. The bar is in the middle and takes up at least half the space. There are only three non-alcoholic beverages on the menu and the one we wanted was out of stock. Oh well, we tried something else.  \\n\\n     The seating area is very small, tables are close together and best for small groups, so get cozy! The couple beside us was on a date, I felt like the third wheel.  It can\\'t be more then 15 feet wide. Its very intimate. Its probably one of those old tenement buildings NY has, that in other cities would be a alley way. Still a cool experience and I enjoy it and the food was excellent. The place was busy with all the seats full, and judging from yelp, its popular.  \\n\\nI\\'d recommend you stop in.', u\"I wanted to give this more like 3.5 stars. So to get it out of the way, the food was really good, and they give a lot of it. Add an egg too your bowl for optimal results.\\n\\nThey don't get 5 stars because the wait on a Monday night for service seemed a bit strange. It wasn't too crowded, but they were definitely understaffed and we seemed to wait a long time for food. That being said, the bartender was great and made delicious drinks while we waited.\", u'Oouuuu Bunsmith was mmh mmhh good. I had the korean fried chicken bowl with zucchini noodles. Came with corn edamame cabbage and I think a lil kimchi. The veggies werent very seasoned which was a bummer but mixed all together it really good. \\n\\nFood came out really quickly and their was a dope playlist going so the time flew. Didnt try any of their cocktails cuz I was battling a hangover but they have a couple bottled sodas and juices in addition to libations. \\n\\nYou should definitely go if you like korean food. My gf had their bah mi sandwich and she fell in love so those are good too!', u\"This place was delicious. I only gave it a 4 because it's slightly pricier. It's a great place to eat and hang out with your friends. The buns were amazing~ we a tried all the buns with meat and one of my top one would be the Korean fried chicken. All of them are good. One bun can be split in half so each person can get a bite. We ordered the pork bowl with zucchini noodles. Super delicious and made you feel less guilty about all the buns you are indulging in. This isn't for everyone but I have to admit that I liked the kimchi back.. it's a shot of Jameson (other liquor available) chased with a shot of kimchi juice. Definitely a fun place to go, they also have a location at the Dekalab market!\", u\"It is a Korean-Taiwanese fusion restaurant and offers buns and rice bowls. I came here with friends and 4 people in total for dinner on Thursday. There was no wait but the place was pretty packed. Standard Brooklyn hipster vibe and affordable and decent food options (~$25 per person if you get a drink, a main course and share appetizer).\\n\\n[Food]\\n\\nTHE dish to recommend is the pork jowl bun (~$5 per bun) - the slow cooked pork takes in all kinds of spices and is very juicy upon bite and it blends in really well with the bun itself. \\n\\nI also got a rice bowl with spicy fried chicken, which probably got its inspiration from Korean bimbimbap, western salad and Korean fried chicken. You can also replace your rice with zucchini spaghetti, which I did. It is pretty decent, and all kinds of veggies blend well together with the fried chicken. \\n\\nBaby artichoke bun is also worth trying - the artichoke is very tender and juicy and is interesting just to see artichoke in a bun. The taste is very unembellished and just the artichoke and bun flour fragrance. \\n\\nAnother bun I had a bite from my friend is cookie butter spam bun - a wild idea but it didn't come along quite well together. It is literally a cookie and a piece of spam inside a bun. The taste of spam is overwhelmed by that of cookie and so is the texture. Interesting gourmet adventure but not worth trying again.\\n\\n[Service] \\n\\nIt took them at least 30 minutes to bring the food and no one came even to explain, maybe because it was too busy. The server was nice and friendly. There is a big seating space in the back. However, the place is not very accessible by city-bike. You have to dock your bike like 8 blocks away and walk there for like 10-15 minutes.\", u\"This place is awesome!  The buns are super yummy and we tried almost all of them and everything is tasty.  The staff are great and very patient when we couldn't decide.  I will definitely be back at some point to pig out.  Just wish they had a few more choices in the bun side but they also have bowls and stuff which I have yet to try.\", u\"I'm SO EXCITED Bunsmith exists. Steamed buns with delicious fillings are my love and now there is restaurant just a few blocks away from me dedicated to them.\\n\\nMy favorite is the Spicy Korean Fried Chicken bun, which is only $4 and is surprisingly filling! I'm one of those tiny framed humans who can actually eat quite a lot, and I can fill up with just 2 of these. Okay, maybe 3. The Soy-Ginger Korean Fried Chicken is good too if you're in the mood for something a little sweeter. The Pork Jowl is fatty and wonderful. \\n\\nFriends I've dragged with me generally pair a bun with one of the bowls. They always finish so I guess they're good! Next time I'm going for the Korean Fried Chicken Nuggets, because hell yes they have those too.\\n\\nTheir selection of drinks is fun including a Koribbean Slushie which is basically a slushie version of my favorite cocktail ever, a white russian! I'm also a fan of the Bootsy Collins, a sweet concoction of bourbon, lemon, rosemary syrup and ginger beer. \\n\\nService has always been fast and friendly (so far I've only sat at the bar). I've seen a lot of folks come here alone, so don't feel you need a companion to indulge in your Korean Fried Chicken bun cravings.\", u\"When I can't get to Ippudo in the city for some pork belly buns, I come here. The buns here are just as delectable and what a variety! I usually have three, but if you're extra hungry, go for four! My favorite meat buns are the pork jowl, spicy korean fried chicken, and the bulgogi. If you're vegetarian, go for the grilled artichoke and BBQ jackfruit. And I think everyone should try the spam and cookie butter (it may sound nasty, but the salty and sweet of it make a perfect pair). Great selection of beers too!\", u'Great buns and great service. The waiter was knowledgeable of the sojus and sakes. The food came out fast and hot. I definitely will come back to try the rest of the food.', u'We came on a rainy Saturday around 530p - it was busy, not crowded, but it got busier as we ate.  Staff is straight to the point, friendly, and not up in your business - I wish more establishment had this \"brooklyn charm\".\\n\\nWe ordered the bulgogi bowl w/ zucchini rice, spicy KFC bao, pork jowl bao, and a spam bao.  Everything was tasty and creative and presented very well.  We wish the bowl wasn\\'t so heavily sauced and that there was more pickled veggies to give it more crunch.  the baos were all flavorful in their own right, but a bit small for their price (similar to the bowl).  \\n\\nOverall a great place with food that brings comfort and smile.  If prices were a tad lower it would be well worth the effort to get visit.  i would come for those baos again, if in the neighborhood, and needing a fix.', u\"Food / $ per sq inch proportion would make me go broke faster than Aaron Carter in his anguished post-spotlight days. HOWEVER...the flavors are to die for. They are exquisite. \\n\\nOrder the pork bun and korean fried chicken. Although everybody raves about the kfc, I think the pork may have outdone it. I also ordered a tofu mushroom one, which did well for itself -- not memorable, as I can't dig up how it tasted in my mind, but I remember thinking it surpassed my standards. And those are pretty lofty.\", u\"FINALLY able to eat here after saying I was going to for like a year. \\nSadly it's a little expensive....and the happy hour only applies to buns (and they don't seem to appreciate butt humor on this so don't even try)\\n\\nHowever the food is DELICIOUSSSSSSS. I said maybe five times while I was eating that I loved the texture of the chicken. It's perfectly fries. I got the spicy chicken bowl and a soy ginger bun. Very good. \\n\\nDownsides include asking for another drink and it never came (wasn't charged for it so at least here's that)\\nThe tables in the back are WAAAAY too close together and I couldn't get out to pee and it was just a whole ordeal. Anyway. Def check it out if you're in Brooklyn!!\", u\"This is a small hipster Korean fusion place with various open style buns, rice bowls are cocktails. The atmosphere is romantic with dim lighting but there's somewhat sound music so there won't be awkward silence if you are on a first date. For food, I only tried the bulgogi bowl and it was delicious but not very authentically Korean. I love that they have a healthier option substituting zucchini spirals for the rice. For cocktails they have 4 different ones incorporating soju, not a great selection but very unique. \\n\\nI'd love to come back and try the buns next time I'm in Brooklyn. It's conveniently located a block away from the Franklin Ave station.\", u\"A great space and always a great meal! It's a go-to in Crown Heights. It's great for take out, a casual date or right before a night out with friends. It's fun atmosphere, good for groups especially if you want to try different things. The bowls can be split and the buns are incredible. I'm a huge fan of the the cauliflower nuggets as an appetizer, either of the two Korean fried chicken buns, and the fried tofu and mushroom bowl. The tofu is super crispy and flavorful. But don't leave without trying the spam and cookie butter bun! It's unreal! A bun with fried spam, a biscoff cookie and cookie butter. So GOOD!\", u\"Came here for some buns after brooklyn botanical garden which is only at 10 minute walk away! \\n\\nHere are the buns I ordered, ranked from most fave to least:\\n1) pork jowl - the pork was 75% lean, 25% fat. PERFECT proportion because even my boyfriend who has a tendency of ripping out excess fat from meat and who doesn't like fatty pork stated that this was his fave bun.\\n1.2) fried chicken (not the spicy one) - you can't go wrong with anything fried, and there is no mistake with choosing this as one of our buns. the sauce was creamy and sweet, i think it was spicy mayo? and the slice of fried chicken was an adequate amount.\\n2) bulgogi - standard bulgogi, this was OK in my opinion.\\n3) artichoke - this was a little below avg for me since the textures for this bun were all too homogenous. because the bun is already soft, the mushiness of the artichoke didn't really help and the only thing that really gave the bun flavor were its sauces. they could add some extra ingredients to give this bun a little more of a crunch.\\n\\nreally appreciated how these buns don't break in half like how some other places do, which means that their buns are solid.\", u\"I got the spicy Korean chicken bun and I'm sad to say that I was disappointed. For about $5, you get a TINY bun with a small amount of pickled veggies, an overwhelming amount of sauce, and a not so crispy piece of chicken. It was definitely. It worth the money, even though it was only $5.\", u\"A wonderful concept but the final product is bland and disappointing. \\n\\nBao buns have been popping up everywhere in NYC and the world is better off for it. My favorite bao is found at Baohaus and I was hoping to find a competitor. They have a solid beer list and Korean alcohols I wasn't interested in. I ordered the fried chicken bao with daikon. They both turned out to disappoint. The fried chicken was crispy but didn't have much flavor and the daikon was also underwhelming without the sour bite I am accustomed to. The bao bun itself was a worthy rendition. \\n\\nThe server was nice and attentive but I can't strongly recommend the place. May try it again to see if I should order something else because godamn I love bao buns.\"], u'197.Maison Premiere': [u\"Love this place! Great for romantic date or friends hang out! Atmosphere is very particular and definitely is not hipster. I would say it has old fashioned vibe of 1920-30d restaurants and bars but with modern exterior.\\n\\nThey specialize in drinks (absinthe), cocktails and oysters, although you can also get standard food too. They are sea food restaurant!  \\n\\nThe menu for the lunch food is relatively small but it's good. They had burgers and small plates. In case of dinner, you can get a big selection of sea food, from lobster rolls to Atlantic Cod. \\n\\nIn terms of oysters, they carry over 26 types. Clams over three types . You can order big plates that combine different types of oyster, clams and crabs and share with friends. \\n\\nAbsinthe- over 20 types plus cocktails! \\n\\nBelieve me it's a good place!\", u\"What a sexy spot!\\n\\nI can see why there's a wait, Maison Premiere is serving up great cocktails & fresh oysters. That combination is like the bat signal in my world. \\n\\nMy wife and I see the bar is full. It's about 12 seats in a semi circle, Maison Premiere isn't a large bar space. We're seated at a two top on the side of the bar. There is a dining room out back, we're just here for a cocktail and oysters.\\n\\nOur waitress lights a candle at our table. I hear the bartenders shaking up cocktails. This place is meant for one thing, fun!\\n\\nI wanted to drink a draft beer, the Maison Premiere Oyster Stout #1but I'm starting to dig Absinthe made cocktails. It's a strange elixir that I never order so I'm game to try something funky.\\n\\nOur drinks come, man that Absinthe makes one awesome cocktail! Holy moley, if I had this place by my house, I'd be here every day trying all the different cocktails. Its that good.\\n\\nMy oysters come to me, fresh and tasty. Mmmm mmm\\n\\nI'm a total fan of Maison Premiere. The hype is real, if you're looking for a great cocktail and freshly shucked oysters in a sexy setting, this is the spot.\", u'Definitely one of the best cocktail bar in NYC. Perfect and creative cocktail. Romanic atmosphere. Perfect for date. Extremely best deal for the happy hours. Quality Oyster for 1.50. \\nBest- must order bread and butter. Super tasty. The seafood menu is extremely delicious too\\nTips- try to come a lot early because this place is always packed.', u'Ambience - 4.5 stars. Loved it. We were seated in the backyard garden and it was so nice with the lights and cute candle-lit patio tables. \\n\\nFood - 4 stars. We got the oysters rockefeller, oyster sampler, and le Maison Plateau with oysters, lobster, crab, scallops, clams and shrimp. Everything was delicious. We also ordered the short rib but it took ridiculously long (maybe because our waitress forgot), so we canceled it. \\n\\nDrinks - 4.5 stars. Really great. I loved the pina colada in the young coconut shell with the M on it. Such a nice touch.\\n\\nService - Very poor. Our waitress was 1 star--she was never around and generally inattentive. We had to ask other waiters for help-- the guys who brought out our oyster platters were very helpful in explaining the oyster selection. We ordered the short rib dish and waited for almost an hour and a half... when we asked our waitress where it was, she did not apologize and dismissively told us that it would be out very soon. Another fifteen mins later and still no word, so we asked this one guy in a suit (manager?) to cancel our dish, and he apologized and was very quick. \\n\\nOverall, I would recommend this place for the ambience, food and drinks, but the service was just so poor. Hopefully, you will not get the same waitress.', u'Amazing drinks.  The back bar is good for a romantic date. The garden is even better.\\nThey might have a line so make sure you call or come 30 minutes ahead', u\"So this is probably one of the best happy hours i've ever been to. And the drinks - not really any cheaper than usual. This is where oysters steal the show, and you're going need a reservation any day of the week. \\n\\nMy buddy made ours a few weeks in advance - and was able to get two tables for two on the patio...which is much less a patio than it is an amazing backyard experience. Honestly, the tables, rocks, trees, chairs...it was like we left NYC and were sitting in someone's backyard in New Orleans.\\n\\nNo wonder I was craving a Mint Julep.\\n\\nNow as I type this i'm sure your mouth is slowly opening and your eyes are getting wider...I came here never having had raw oysters before. I love seafood, raw and cooked, but never really proactively tried them, and never found myself in a basically mandatory oyster ordering situation, until now.\\n\\nWell, now I love oysters.\\nI also love oysters at Maison Premiere.\\nI love oysters on happy hour.\\n\\nWe had oysters from all regions of the East and West coast, but I have to say my favorites came from PEI and Cape Cod. Add some lemon, a little bit of cocktail sauce, and a dash of the best horseradish I've ever had...and you'll blow through close to 50 in no time. \\n\\nBe sure to complement these fine sea creatures with your drink of choice - very cold, very refreshing lighter style local IPA, which paired quite well. \\n\\nRemember: HH is over at 7, and then oysters get less $1-$1.50 and much more normally priced. \\n\\nGo to Brooklyn, make reservations, eat a literal ton of oysters.\", u'Omg this is now my favorite oyster happy hour in New York!  Great selection.  Also amazing drinks - apparently these guys won the James Beard Award for outstanding bar which is really impressive.\\n\\nSuper cute restaurant space.  LOVELY lovely Art Deco decor.  Vintage New Orleans (?) vibe.  Manageable wait time which is insane to me!  If this place were in Manhattan there would be a crowd lining up around the block for tables at brunch.\\n\\nSo in order of descending impressiveness:\\n\\nSuper large cocktail list.  Including a large absinthe menu which you don\\'t see often.  So many cocktails looked amazing that I struggled to choose.  Ended up going with Absinthe Colada for a hot day which tasted and looked great.  They also had a couple of very interesting Bloody Mary\\'s I saw lots of people ordering.\\n\\nGorgeous space - both the bar area and the super cute outdoor seating in the back.  I also loved how the waitstaff was impeccably dressed.\\n\\nOysters!  Happy hour had 4-5 east and west coast varieties, for $1.25-1.5.  No Blue Points here!  They looked pretty fresh and were mostly shucked well.\\n\\nGreat service.  Waiter gave super detailed drink recommendations (I can understand needing some extra help when the menu is that long!).\\n\\nNon-oyster food is also delicately made with good attention to detail.  I\\'m not a fan of \"brunch food\" like eggs or potatoes etc etc but my brunch companions liked what they had (duck hash).\\n\\nGreat value proposition overall.  Need to find more excuses to make it out to Williamsburg!', u'This place is a 3.5 star but I decided to be nice and round up, I came here after having a drink at \"post office\" near by because they had a larger selection of cocktail drinks and I have had this place booked marked on yelp for ages. After walking the five blocks from post office to here we weren\\'t really greeted by a hostess, I couldn\\'t tell if we weren\\'t welcomed or if the place was closing.. I asked if this was Maison premiere and she said yes and just stood there guarding the door not saying anything else... I was a little confused but I decided to precede and said to her table for two please, THEN she let us inside after a brief hesitation... am I asking for too much when I want to feel welcomed to any place I patron at? (This is the main reason why I took a point and half off) if I don\\'t feel welcomed the moment I enter a place it kinda ruins the mood for the rest of the night..\\n\\nThe drinks were definitely on point I can see why this place is so popular, my friend and I decided to sit at the bar and I actually preferred it, got to see the bar tenders at work! I actually don\\'t know what my first drink was called, I found a picture on yelp and showed them what I wanted.. it was good but my second drink the mint and cucumber was better. (I could drink that all night!!) my friend ordered some coconut cream drink and was not a fan of it because it had licorice in it (his fault for not reading the description) I\\'m not a fan of licorice either but it must have been a popular drink there because we saw 5 other people order it\\n\\nThis place is dimly lit with ceiling fans and well dressed bar tenders and waiters, it feels like you stepped back in time. Although I didn\\'t see any AC this place was a lot cooler(temp wise ) compared to post Office near by. It is a great place to catch up with friends and have a drink, you don\\'t feel rushed to order drinks after drinks and I liked that about this place. I got to sit back, relax and enjoy the delicious cocktails.\\n\\nI would highly recommend this place, hopefully you will have a friendlier hostess than the girl I got.', u'Visited on a Friday afternoon for drinks. The bartenders are top-notch. I like to measure a bartender by going off menu, giving them an ingredient and flavor profile. What I was given at Maison Premiere were great cocktails that met my request and exceeded my expectation every time.', u'I have been on an oyster education recently and this place takes the cake. One of the few places to have kumamotos in the east coast because apparently, they are highly difficult to transport. These little guys are amazing with a super clean finish. Also, I realized my favorite oyster to date is the Royal Miyagi - I really want to make a wax on wax off joke here but nothing seems worthy. Beyond being a little in oyster heaven this place might have the best shrimp and grits in the east coast. It was so good me and my partner had 2 plates. It was super glutinous but taste them and then disagree with me. \\n\\nThe decor is super cool, although this place is more of a swanky bar than restaurant and the outdoor garden is beautiful. IF you are into absinthe there is a full absinthe cocktail menu for you to choose from - the taste of anise is not my cup of tea but the menu looked amazing.', u\"Had a great experience at this place. The waiters and hostess were really helpful! We were sitting behind the bar originally, but we asked to see if there were any seats outside, they were able to move us outside once the seats opened up. The environment was so great! The oysters were really fresh, we didn't catch the happy hour(ends at 7pm) but we still ordered some to try, def worth it. My favorite was the Atlantic cod, it was so juicy and tender! One tip if you want to sit outside and you attract mosquitos like me, ask the waiters for insect repellent, (they had OFF) it really helps you enjoy the outdoors at night much more!!\", u\"Pros :   Like what everyone is saying on the ambiance and drinks\\nCons: it them almost 2 hours to serve our food .  Mussels we ordered for our appetizer are sandy so don't order it.  Now on the entree, tiny portion of the $27 seabass and $26 Atlantic cod.  They should charge more than sacrifice the the serving size.  Note though that both dishes were delicious.\", u\"Came here for a second time for brunch and had a MUCH better experience. My friend and I aren't fans of oysters so we didn't do the happy hour, but the regular brunch menu did not disappoint. My last issue was mainly service related, and this time around we had an excellent waiter.\\n\\nDRINKS:\\nGot the iced coffee with milk which was served in a tall drinking glass and cute milk jar. Tasted yummy! There's a lot of cocktail options to make your brunch boozy if you're interested, but didn't try any of the alcohol\\n\\nFOOD:\\nButter scone - so good and warm and fresh. Just one serving but if you're craving a little good to split with someone else who loves morning pastries!\\n\\nTruffle toast - not my fave on the menu. Still good but pretty basic scramble over toast minus the truffle which is a nice touch but not super noticeable.\\n\\nHomemade Sweet and Salty Granola - loved this too-pretty-to-eat bowl. Not personally filling enough for an entire meal but perfect to start/share with the table. Fresh yogurt topped with fruit and chia seeds\\n\\nBrioche French Toast - my favorite on the menu! Perfectly crispy/soft with the perfect amount of flavor. There's a subtle gingery/floral taste but it's not overwhelming. It's also so nicely plated\\n\\nStrawberry lemonade sorbet - so refreshing and tasty as a summer dessert!\\n\\nAMBIANCE: the outdoor garden/patio situation in the back is so cute and hard to find in Manhattan. very quaint with a cute table set up - doesn't feel too crowded \\n\\nI'd definitely recommend/visit again to try some of the other brunch dishes.\", u\"The formula here is simple:\\n\\nOysters + Space = PHENOM + Staff = RUDE\\n\\nThe Oysters = Absolutely fantastic. Whoever sources these puppies should be walking around MP's kitchen in a bedazzled & feathered tiara.\\n\\nThe Space = Cute, cozy, well decorated, prohibition-style. \\n\\nThe Staff = Luckily I was with good company, but we were both made to feel as if we were taking up space, rather than being there to enjoy the ambiance, experience and food. In all fairness, the overall staff was uneventful - a little cocky, but tolerable. The bartender who made our drinks & took our oyster order, however, was the real gem here. I mean, for his sake, I hope he was having a bad day... I'm not sure anyone would want to deal with that mug and condescending attitude on a daily basis. I'll forgive him, but for now, he's earned himself two stars. \\n\\nPLOT TWIST: what if the bartender and the person who sources the oysters are the same person?! OMG. I don't even want to think about the possibility.\", u\"I thought this place was fantastic. I went for their oyster happy hour: I had fresh oysters, cocktails, and fresh bread with seaweed butter (sounds weird, but it's salty and yummy!). \\n\\nI love that you can fill out an order form for the oysters (over 10 options), and a print out of the oysters are brought out with the oysters so you can keep track of which ones you're eating. This is perfect for someone like me who will try most things once! Now I know which ones I prefer and can re-order them next time. \\n\\nWatching the bartenders make their drinks was really like watching live art. Sounds corny, but it's true. They really take mixology to the next level. Their drinks are complex and different - I love them. They don't have happy hour drinks, but they're made so well I don't mind spending $15 on them... well, maybe just a little.\", u\"Impromptu date night ended up great here. There was a short wait for around ~8pm on a Friday night. We grabbed drinks at a bar around the corner and got texted to return before we even received our cocktails, so not not bad. \\n\\nWe wanted a table and were seated side by side next to the bar. It's a bit cramped so a heads up for anyone who may be uncomfortable with such a narrow space. I wouldn't recommend it for a first date, and thankfully this wasn't, haha. The restaurant has a back area that mimics a patio, it's quite nice and I would've rather been seated there. Regardless, still had a lovely time.\\n\\nThe food was amazing! Oysters so fresh and briny, and our server's recommendations were on point. The bread\\nplatter with seaweed butter is a steal and a must get--we were wary of the seaweed butter at first, sounds gross right, but it actually pairs incredibly well with all the seafood. The sea urchin is another must get, so clean and sweet, with the salty caviar complementing perfectly. The cod I would skip--tasted like just mashed potatoes. Octopus was perfectly cooked, soft and soaked with flavor. We paired everything with the chenin blanc from France, an incredibly tasty white that really elevated all the flavors. And we had to finish with the absinthe pina colada that everyone had--equally amazing, strong and creamy. \\n\\nService was stellar from beginning to end. My date, silly guy, decided to start off with a red (with seafood?! I know right). After trying my white, he didn't want to touch his pinot noir, of course. Our server actually noticed and offered to exchange his glass. That's A+ right there. The hostesses were pleasant to us as well. I loved all the service staffs' outfits!\\n\\nThe only cons were how expensive everything came out to be (ended up ~$170 after tip and tax, for two) and how long we had to wait between each dish. The bread and butter came after the oysters, urchin, and cod. Kind of awkward. Then there was a 20 minute wait just for the octopus. Overall spent around two hours here for dinner, which is nice when you're in good company, but if you're not.......don't bring a first date here basically haha. Also, they didn't have any west coast oysters that day, which was quite disappointing. \\n\\nStill, definitely a great intimate and fun place for a date or catching up with a close friend.\", u\"I may have found my new haunt in Maison.  This New Orleans-themed restaurant is everything I love without being cheesy.  Get ready for candlelight, tiny french doors, blues and killer cocktails.  I had the chance to go here on the evening of my birthday.  They were one of a few spots open at 2:00 AM.  Also, they're open until 4 AM on weekends.  How nice is it that you don't have to go to a hole in the wall diner just to enjoy decent food and drinks at 2:00 AM?  I think it's pretty great.\\n\\nAnyway, my favorite parts of Maison.  \\n\\n1.  The bathroom.  I cannot overstate how important bathrooms are to me now that I have moved to New York.  Most are gross, cramped, tiny, not clean, terrible, old.  Ugh.  The bathroom at Maison literally smells GREAT.  I was freaked out by it, actually.  It didn't smell sterile, it smelled like vanilla and incense.  And it was clean and I felt comfortable.  And at 2:00 AM, these were not a part of my expectations.\\n\\n2. My dirty gin martini.  How the bartender managed to achieve such a balanced drink with so much strength, I'll never know.  But he did and I thank him.\\n\\n3.  The ambiance.  I feel like I could curl up next to my date and whisper sweet somethings into her ear and it would be totally fine.  The place is SEXY!\\n\\nService is okay.  I actually thought the bartender hated us until he made everyone strawberry daiquiri shots.  He probably still wasn't the most friendly bartender on earth but he was certainly professional and made great cocktails.  I plan to go back for dinner service and see if these 4 stars will move up to 5 or down to 3.\", u\"Overall experience was pleasant and definitely worth a trip back. It ties second place with another NYC fav.\\n\\nWe visited on a Saturday afternoon, it wasn't a mad house but seats at tables were filled. The hostess was accommodating and found us two seats at the Oyster Bar, and seeing how I'm no oyster connoisseur, it was the perfect seat in the house. Sean the shucking guy (lol) was so kind as to give me my first lesson. East Coast and West Coast?? Which one are better, all a matter of your taste buds. Sooo...how do I know what I like right, I ordered a platter of a dozen and Sean gave me a combo. I am born and bred an East Coast gal, and so are my taste buds. Those Cape May Salt oysters are devine! Washed it all down with a French 75, which was just okay in my opinion, I've had better.\\n\\nThe negatives of this place, being charged $4 for bread. The mixed salad is really not a salad, its lacks actual salad ingredients, its mixed greens and you pay for $4 for a small plate of it. When we went there wasn't really a soup selection (the upside- the Chef put together a chowder). The shrimp, although very good, cost me $3.50 each. Anything less than 8 is just not enough.\\n\\nDon't count on leaving full, but it is a great spot to splurge on some delicacies.\", u'Walking past this nondescript building with the sign \"Bar | Oysters\" on its facade, one might think divey or meh kinda bar. Au contraire my fellow Yelpers! Step back in time to the roaring 20\\'s, or maybe 30\\'s, I thought that an old skool gangster with a Tommy gun may appear. The bartenders wore suspenders and skinny ties, coiffeur perfectly gelled, parted to the side. This place is more than extraordinary. Sitting at the bar catered more to those drinking and eating oysters but that was OK because there really is no bad seat. I think you\\'ll catch the same vibe no matter where you sit. The woodwork is amazing and you gotta see the bathrooms!\\n\\nOur waitress came by with a few menus. One with quite an array of Absinthe concoctions. I, with the absolute zero knowledge of what it is other than knowing its existence, asked. She gave me a wealth of knowledge and I\\'m glad to say most of it was retained. Get this.... I 100% loathe/detest/can\\'t stand the taste of black licorice. Feeling adventurous, I waved my left index finger and picked one.  The one I picked was more on the bitter side, so she suggested another. What I can say is, somehow, the finish or back end of the drink tasted bizarrely creamy IMO. All in all she really knows her stuff and thanks for making this noob feel much better about himself. \\n\\nI\\'d go back on my next trip to Bedford Ave, Brooklyn for sure. It\\'s that cool, and I gotta call one of those bartenders\"Mugsey\" or something.\\n\\nBtw.. I fricken still hate the taste of anise.', u'I visited Maison Premiere last weekend and expected great service and good drinks. Unfortunately the service was not so great. We wanted to sit at the bar, but that is reservation only so we sat at one of the side tables.\\n\\nAt first the beer my friend and I wanted was not available but it took quite a while for the server to come back and tell us that. Luckily, they suggested another beer that I did like, however when my friend wanted an iced tea instead they never ended up getting her iced tea and accidentally charged us for it. I think we were forgotten about, sitting at the side tables.\\n\\nFor a cute, high-end spot in Williamsburg with relatively expensive drinks I would expect excellent service, rather than the experience we had. If I returned I would sincerely hope this was just a one-off situation.'], u'26.Seed': [u'At first when I saw the prices I thought \"C\\'mon... can it be THAT much better than my favorite falafel cart???\".\\n\\nThe short answer is Yes... it\\'s that much better and more.  Shame on your falafel cart!  Don\\'t bring that isht near here!  Seed should be your one and only goto Mediterranean spot in the hood and yes... they deliver!  This is Mediterranean cuisine like you\\'ve never had it before (unless, of course, you\\'re from the Mediterranean).\\n\\nSo what to get?  Uhhh.... everything?  The chef\\'s mezze platters are unreal.  I could eat just that over and over again as a meal.  All of the lamb dishes are perfect.  Just close your eyes and pick something.  I don\\'t see how you can possibly go wrong.', u\"Very pricey to start with. Dinner with 1 appetizer and 2 main courses, no drinks, no dessert, no soda or coffee set us back $75. Park slope prices are on the high end, but was it worth it? Not really.\\n\\nI'll go with my regular food+service and ambience scenario.\\n\\nFood was great, service.... mmmmm... not so sure... there was barely any to be exact to get more or less objective evaluation. Hubby left 20% tip because he always does, but there was nothing to leave a tip for to be honest.\\n\\nWe walked in around dinner time on Sunday. There were 2 tables in the entire place, and none on the pretty terrace. We were seated immediately, with nice and warm welcome, but when we asked for a bigger table because there was almost nobody in the entire place - we were advised that its almost rush hour, so no. Not for anything, but we didn't notice any rush hour crowd. In fact, when we left an hour later, the restaurant was empty inside, totally, with one table left not he terrace. Oh well, I guess we missed the crowd somehow.\\n\\nWe had a small meze plate ($15) which is a selection of 5 chef's choices of Turkish spreads. All were great, I have no complaints on that matter. It came with 3 rolls though, which under no circumstances were remotely close to any type of Turkish bread I've tried so far. And I've been to few Turkish/Mediterranean cuisine establishments. Bread was just great, and Seed's were regular white baguette-ish type of rolls. Not something I would expect to go with humus and baba ganoush\\n\\nWe got lamb skewers ($21) and octopus ($22). Fresh, great food, server had no problem subbing potatoes with salad and dressing came on the said as I asked - no complaints on that matter at all. Portions are somewhat small, but adequate.\\n\\nFood came out also relatively fast, we had time to enjoy the appetizer, but didn't have to lick the plate waiting for the main course to arrive.\\n\\nAnd after that we were left absolutely alone. No service, no tissues, no salt shakers on the table - and nobody around to ask.Don't get me wrong - everyone we dealt with were really nice. When they were actually there. It wasn't a poor service - just a lack of such. 7 pm Sunday. Not that I care about pouring my own water, but we had to ask for a check twice, second time I literally walked to the register myself. \\n \\nHence, not a bad experience, just blah. \\n\\nWould I come back? I don't think we can afford to really with these prices. So the chances are very slim with tons of options around with better selection and pricing. Checked off the list, not a keeper and not on our 'to go/recommend to friends' list for sure.\", u'Here\\'s the review I should\\'ve written: \\n\\nWe went to Seed on a weekend afternoon because Miriam was packed. This place was relatively empty. \\n\\nWe were not impressed at all. The drinks were expensive for not freshly squeezed. Perhaps it was because it was lunch time - but the food was mediocre, the portions lacking, and the prices far too generous. As frequent diners of the cuisine, we would not recommend. Apparently the menus we were given were incorrect - so that error might, to some extent, bridge what we expected and what we got. \\n\\n1 star. \\n\\n------\\n\\nUpdate after your response: \\nWhile I have absolutely no problems being corrected, I will stick with my initial review. Snarky responses are really fun, but they don\\'t mean much. \\n\\nIf your juices are indeed not out of a carton, I would suggest serving them in their original bottles. Restaurants often do that so people don\\'t assume they are fresh. I also don\\'t think it\\'s unreasonable for diners to expect fresh juice at $5 a pop, but maybe that\\'s just my opinion. \\n\\nThere were no grill marks on your lamb, but I guess I was wrong. I stand corrected. Maybe I was unable to tell because there was so little of it on my plate. Was I wrong about the white-meat-chicken-thighs? - you didn\\'t respond to that part.\\n\\nHere\\'s the review you think would be more respectable: Your food is mediocre, your juices taste bad, your prices are expensive, and your portions are lacking. Bonus opinion: Your response to criticism was defensive and judgmental.\\n\\n------\\n\\nI don\\'t usually review restaurants on yelp, but this place is exceptionally bad. I have no idea why it\\'s so well rated. \\n\\nThe $5 \"organic juices\" are straight out of the Tropicana box. The $21 \"charcoal grilled lamb\" is not charcoal grilled. The $18 \"chicken thighs\" are white meat. \\n\\nDeceptive, mediocre and expensive. One star is too many.', u\"I really enjoyed the food here. It is a bit on the pricier side but it's not just your run of the mill gyro wraps or the such. I went here w/ my wife and our friend who's vegan. Yes if you have vegetarian or vegan friends or you yourself are, this place definitely has great options for you. The salmon and the potatoes were amazing!!! My wife got the lamb casserole and the lamb was tender and not gamey which was great. I would definitely come here again. Although at the end, we were just sitting there for like 30 minutes and our waiter never came to ask if we wanted to dessert or a check.\", u\"This is my new favorite restaurant in Park Slope, and definitely in my Top 3 in Brooklyn.\\n\\nPlace is nice without feeling out of place in shorts and t-shirt. \\n\\nWaiter opened the bottle of wine I had picked up from nearby Red, White & Bubbly and was kind enough to pour it into one of their water jars for me when I asked (which look like decanters anyway :)\\n\\nStarted with the Large Mezze platter (7 different kinds, all vegetarian, all chefs choice)... absolutely delicious. \\n\\nHummus, perfect, Red Pepper, perfect, Fava, so-so, Red Lentil, amazing, Eggplant Salad (normally my favorite) - delicious but the other items just blew me away. Normally don't even like stuffed grape leaves... but I loved these!\\n\\nThe mezze came with small rolls, which was a bit odd to me. They were delicious, but I find flatter breads (e.g. pitas) to be easier to rip and dunk with hummus style dips.\\n\\nWe did the Octopus to share. While we took our time sipping our nice bottle, he wanted to confirm if we were ready for the Octopus yet. Told him we would wait. When we were ready, it came out right away, so I was a little worried it had been sitting there for a while. Not the case at all. Absolutely fresh, absolutely perfectly cooked... meaty, tender, delicious.\\n\\nGot the chocolate cake for dessert, which was more like a brownie (though I have a French friend who makes a similar gateau and calls it cake as well). Good, just was odd that it was warm on one side but harder, colder on the other. Still very good.\\n\\nI don't think there's much I would change here, and I have a feeling I will slowly be making my way through the rest of the menu soon. Lamb Chops... I'm coming for ya.\", u'We chose this place based on the yelp reviews and it did not let us down. Amazing flavor. Great Service.  Cute place with an outdoor area.  This is as close as to home made as you will get at a restaurant! definitely coming back . \\nWe had the lamb casserole and salmon, shepherds salad, yogurt spread, and the zuchinni cakes are phenomenal!', u\"Stopped in here at random with my sister for lunch. The menu looked good - we were looking for light food, and weren't expecting it at a Mediterranean restaurant - so we decided to try it. We got a spinach pie and the Seed salad, which were both excellent. It was just enough food for a hot afternoon. My sister enjoyed her watermelon mimosa as well. If I make it back to Brooklyn before she moves away, I will definitely be back for dinner. \\n\\nFour stars because while the food and beverage were excellent, the service was just okay. We didn't see our waiter very much, and I was drinking a lot of water so wanted refills. Toward the end of our lunch we realized that there's a back patio and he was spending most of his time out there. It seemed like there may have only been one server for the entire place, which felt insufficient (especially during Brooklyn Pride).\", u'The grilled items here are delicious! The octopus was fantastic. The service was the only thing that was a little off. They kinda forgot about us in the front but overall, really good food made up for it. The eggplant meze and stuffed grape leaves are yummy starters :)', u'Seed is a cozy Mediterranean spot located in Park Slope a trendy neighborhood known for its variety of world cuisines welcomes this new restaurant that serves exceptional Turkish food. The places design is \"small but complex\" its decorated beautifully and the food is extremely fresh. We\\'ve tried all the cold appetizers, which were all seasoned right and very fresh. We had the lamb chops, lamb kebab and the kofte which were all delicious the service was attentive and exceptional. The parking is on the street no lots or anything so park slope could get a little crowded so plan accordingly. Between the food,service and the atmosphere the price we paid was fair, so this isn\\'t one of those places where you would break the bank. If you\\'re ever in BK and want to try a different type of Mediterranean experience on park slope stop by this place.', u'I was really excited to try Seed - it\\'s in my neighborhood, and I always pass it and think \"I should come here soon!\"\\n\\nI met a friend for dinner on a week night, and the restaurant had a few other people, but wasn\\'t crowded, so it was a nice, chill environment.\\n\\nThe wait staff was friendly and the space is really cute.  I ordered the zucchini pancakes and hummus.  The pancakes were yummy, though a little greasy - but hey, not complaining.  The hummus was tasty, served as two scoops that sort of resembled ice cream scoops, and came with home made rolls.  I think I would have preferred pita bread, but the rolls were okay.  The hummus was tasty and seemed fresh.\\n\\nI enjoyed my meal - and my friend liked her lentil balls salad.  I\\'d recommend Seed for a low key and tasty Mediterranean meal.', u\"I really wanted to like this place but it was disappointing on almost all accounts.\\n\\nFood: we had the Octopus dish, mixed Chef plate, and lamb skewers.  The Octopus, by far, the most questionable and disappointing dish.  It came out in a weird presentation (unlike the pictures) and it was incredibly mushy to the point that I wanted to return the entree.  It was either undercooked or the Octopus was old.  The varied Chef plate has an assortment of different dips and sauces; the hummus was good but everything else was mediocre.  The lamb skewers were cooked medium rare and, with the yogurt sauce, it was tasty.\\n\\nPrices: This is an overpriced Mediterranean place.  We left paying $40 per person for an entree and appetizer to share.  This wasn't worth the value and quality of food.\\n\\nSpace: The only positive of this place was the place.  It is surprisingly large and can fit many parties.  We had dinner on a Friday night and it was empty, so I expect that it's generally easy to get a seat without reservations.\\n\\nOverall, I wouldn't come back.  Not worth the prices  and the food was so questionable.\", u'Basically enjoyed my meal.  I had a cold appetizer plate, my favorite of which was a bean dip.  No pita, but homemade bread (ok, not great).  Tasted excellent lentil soup and yogurt dip.  Friends enjoyed their chicken and salad.  One friend ordered stuffed calamari and had to send it back for being too tough.', u'Very intimate, modern Turkish food. Presentation is great. Nice portions. Rose mimosa is pretty good. Menemem was not the best one I had, but appetizers and pasty-like entry with spinach was amazing.', u\"Very impressed by there food! The grilled octopus was outstanding such as the lamp casserole. Only thing I could be finding as a lack would be the service attitude. However that wouldn't hold me back from returning.\", u\"Came here for dinner and was plesantly surprised! It's a cute spot in Park Slope near some other resturants. The space is pretty minimalist and sparse. My friends and I came for an early Sunday evening dinner -- I think that we were the first people there, but after a while, tables started to fill up. \\n\\nWe ordered the appetizer sampler. Oh man, everything was delicious! It's a sampling of the chef's choice of various appetizers. The lentils were amazing! I was hoping to get the lamb skewers, but unfortunately, they ran out. The server recommended that I get the lamb chops instead. That was nicely prepared and the lamb was tender.  I think that the winner for the night was really the appetizer sampler!\", u\"The owner and workers are so friendly!  GREAT customer service! Everything we ordered was AMAZING! Especially loved the lentil soup. Different than anything I've tried! Would definitely come back!!!\", u'I came to Seed for dinner based upon the very positive yelp reviews, and wow this place earns a very solid 5 stars. What an amazing restaurant- the food was  delicious, and I still am in shock at how perfect the baklava was. Truly I don\\'t think baklava could be any better than what I had tonight, and I consider myself rather \"well versed\" haha. On another note, the waiters are very friendly and accommodating. Absolutely will be returning to this place!', u'Everytime i would pass by it would be packed but I came ealry this time (3pm son Thursday), empty! Yeah for me!\\nI ordered lentil soup and zuchinni fritters, soup was decent, fritters were perfectly seasoned and fried. I would go back.', u\"It's just past the fringes of the more popular Park Slope establishments closer to Flatbush, but Seed was a solid, quieter option past the masses. I will say it exceeded my expectations from what I expected, but it did fall under another solid restaurant amongst the multitudes that seem to be popping up in this area and city as our palates become more refined.\\n\\nI will give a shoutout to the large mixed mezze platter which I ordered as a way to be healthy. From the light creamy beets, to the eggplant, carrot salad, sweet rice or pilaf, and the currant stuffed grape leaves (I'm forgetting a couple) ... it was a really great choice that was filling yet not heavy. \\n\\nIf you're in the area, definitely come check it out, because I think lunch here with some specials could be a solid decision.\", u\"I don't have Mediterranean much but I think I can say I'm not overly enthusiastic about this place(zucchini pancake, rolled borek, and lamb chops) I have always loved lamb chops but my boyfriend's were comparable and he isn't an experienced cook. Haha\"], u'78.Charlotte Patisserie': [u\"My friend and I stopped in after seeing a a grand opening sign outside. We enjoyed the quaint lovely bakery. Cappuccino was delicious, staff are super friendly but what shines are the baked goods. We ordered a carrot cake and I had the passion fruit and orange pastry. I've been searching for something just like it for years. So glad to see this new addition to the neighborhood. I wish I wasn't full of dinner cause I couldn't finish the entire thing I had to take some home to enjoy later :)\", u\"Saw this new patisserie the other day when looking to get some coffee and a light bite with a friend, and I was not disappointed. The restaurant is bright and airy, the decor simple without being dull. I had a raspberry creme brulee, something which I didn't know existed but I'm now very glad I do! It was really more of a mousse on top of an airy layer of cake, which was absolutely fantastic. My friend got the chocolate mousse, which she could not stop raving about, which was covered in a chocolate foil. I tried some, and neither could I. This will be a great addition to the many culinary choices in this neighborhood, which is already why I find myself visiting often. Now I have another reason.\"], u'10.Tin Kettle': [u'Loved this place!  Great music, great atmosphere, great bartender (Hey B!).\\n\\nI ordered a Bourbon based drink named \"Nobody Knows We\\'re Smashing\" or something like that.  It was delicious.  I wound up with 3 by the end of the night!  I also ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with a side salad.  The salad dressing wasn\\'t too good but that was my fault.  I should\\'ve gotten the fries like B suggested, but I was trying to be semi healthy.   That sandwich, tho?  Amazing!\\n\\nHappy Hour until 7 pm.\\nCan\\'t wait to go back!', u\"Very nice atmosphere...\\nDrinks are really good!! The woman bartender was super friendly and the guy checking on everything (I think he is the owner) always smiles and adds this warm vibe to the place...\\nThe food is good too. It's more of a bar place so don't expect superb food...\\nThe one star came off for the looooooong wait for food! Omg! Why does it take so long to make a burger and fries? I'm confused :(\\nIf I were in the vicinity I would definitely come back for a drink because they keep this place very nice and pretty. The area has lots of bars and stuff but this place leaves you feeling nice! The people that come in make it more relaxed because they are very chill - Amy Winehouse status. Lol. I came on Saturday night pretty late so I don't know what it's like other nights but this night was perfect. Stop in if you have a chance :)\", u\"Tin Kettle is a small bar and restaurant right on Vanderbilt avenue near a bunch of other cool restaurants, bakeries, ice cream shops and so forth. It's hard to miss at first because the awning doesn't stick out but you def don't want to pass it. The food is soooo good.\\n\\nWhen you walk inside you're greeted with the sounds of 2000s and 90s r&b music from Joe to Mary J Blige. Kind of random for the area but hey, lol. This is the second time I've been there and the waiter was just as accommodating and nice as the last. I sat in front by the windows and glass door where the scenery of the pavement is pretty cool. The tables are very high and wooden by the way but they're accompanied by high wooden stools which helps short people like myself haha. \\n\\nI ordered the Kentucky poutine fries--a southern twist on French poutine which is French fries drenched in gravy and chooses. But the Tin Kettle version has bits of fried chicken on top which is OMG so good. The fries were crispy to perfection and the toppings were so creamy. Everything was filling enough for me to eat it as a meal. I also had a virgin margarita which was alright, nothing serious. It was pretty though. \\n\\nThe one thing that isn't appealing are the paper containers on the left side of the table which holds ketchup and other condiments. Although it's supposed to give a BBQ vibe it's not a BBQ place so it cheapens things. Otherwise nice place! The bathrooms are clean too, a plus.\", u'I wanted to LOVE this place\\nWHO: Party of 2\\nWHY: late evening hunger\\nWHAT: (Deets) The drinks (We Smashin\\' on the Low & The Missy) were pretty good, but took 10/15 mins to arrive, with less than 10 other patrons in the restaurant. On what was a warm night, we were not given water until we asked. And our cups were stacked versus placed individually in front of both of us. Odd. \\nWe arrived hungry. Our main courses (burgers, fries) came out BEFORE our apps (wings, boiled peanuts). Where they do THAT at?My burger (the Dine-in, I think) was ok. I ate half of it. My fellow diner enjoyed the burger (mostly for the bun) & ate most of his. \\nThe wings were like fried chicken- more batter dipped than traditional \"hot wings\". Shrug. I only ate 1.\\nThe boiled peanuts were VERY salty. I could feel my blood vessels constricting as I ate all of 5. I literally couldn\\'t eat any more, just too much sodium. Based on the terrific Yelp rating, I thought this would be a foodie dream come true, and with the other terrific food on the Vanderbilt strip, I was sure I was in for a treat. Not so.\\nWHEN: 10:30pm-ish 6/10/17\\nWHERE: dine in\\nHOW: car\\nBATHROOM: gender neutral, stocked with essentials, cute faucet set-up\\nWIFI: *shrug*\\nDRESS CODE: as you like\\nSERVICE: cordial and pretty customer-sensitive. When our server Dexter saw overheard that we weren\\'t satisfied through our quiet chatter, he asked how he could help change that. At that point, unless a full refund was provided, there wasn\\'t much redemption. But kudos to him for asking.\\nBOTTOM LINE: I wanted to LOVE this place. After all, attaining 4.5 Stars on Yelp is commendable. I believe it\\'s more about the ambiance than the food. I had high hopes that weren\\'t met. If it were an option, 2.5 stars is more appropriate. There are many other delish foodie-worthy options on Vanderbilt.\\nTIP: the back (it appears) has a retractable roof. Sit on the bench to get the best view.', u\"Really wonderful place for so many reasons. The bartender Juanita is an angel, so sweet and makes you feel incredibly welcome, like you're part of the family. Drinks, food, music are all great. And the customers are really really cool...I came alone twice and ended up being really cool friendly people that kept me great company and even bought drinks. This is now officially my new go to.\", u'As the Duchess of Ample Hills Creamery *pats own back* I am on this block often and one day I noticed the patrons of the cozy Tin Kettle looked so happy with thier top 100 hip hop playing and liquor flowing. I needed in on this action! I made my way on a random Sunday and I was happy I did. My experience wasn\\'t as \"poppin\" but it was more of a nice lazy Sunday afternoon vibe. The sun was shining in the back patio and the bees were pollinating the fresh flowers that add to the natural d\\xe9cor.  \\nMy curry shrimp and grits was a hearty dish that made me feel like a sloth half way though eating it. The curry shrimp was saut\\xe9ed with onions and peppers. my friends burger with the fried egg also tasted great.  The prices were amaze balls given there was a happy hour special on the weekend - score! $5 mimosas, $9 cocktails and reasonably priced ipa\\'s.  The server here was an awesome guy that was very accommodating and thorough with explaining brunch menu.', u\"Is it a sports bar? Is it vaguely NOLA themed? Do they have a limited but pretty good beer selection? The answer is yes! \\n\\nWe came here to kill time before a dinner reservation and were seriously considering just eating here because the entire place smelled like delicious fries. We also saw the chunky burgers and po boys come out of the kitchen as well. \\n\\nIf I had one complaint, it's that there's not really any standing room. So if you can't snag a seat or are trying to order a drink at the bar, you're in everyone's way.\\n\\nWould definitely return to try some food and catch a game!\", u'Food was pretty good, they cook your burger to the correct temperature. The bartender was super fun! Good music playing. Overall good experience', u\"What a great spot in Prospect Heights! Newer joint, but what a fantastic addition to the neighborhood. The GF and I popped in on our way up to Williamsburg. First and foremost, warm and friendly staff, really know how to welcome customers. We sat at the bar and just jammed on some beers and sammies. My lady tore through a delicious cobb salad. I went head first into one of the chicken sandwiches, alas I can't remember which one as they don't have a website for reference, but it was FANTASTIC!\\n\\nThe price point the Kettle is perfect - you're looking at $10 to $12 for sammies and roughly the same for salads. Beer is in the $6 range. The cocktails I didn't have a chance to explore, but given that it's right around the corner from my lady's place, I know we'll be back. Will be sure to update my review after our 2nd round. \\n\\nFYI - a beautiful looking backyard, and when this godforsaken weather cools down a bit, I'll be sure to test it out. \\n\\nTeam Kettle - biggest suggestion - make a website.\", u\"Great bar on Vanderbilt. Happy hour is 4-7 every weekday, and they have great deals--$2 off cocktails (all cocktails are normally $11), $2 off drafts (mostly $5-$6 regularly), and $2 off well drinks.\\n\\nI tried the cucumber cooler cocktail which is light and refreshing but also has a taste of fennel bitters which wasn't my favorite combination. Additionally, I got the spicy cherry lime rickey cocktail which was FANTASTIC. Definitely recommend! We also ordered some bar food, which was all very reasonably priced. The garlic herb fries are worth the buy ($6).\\n\\nThey were playing nice, not too loud music and had a few TVs playing sports. Something for everyone at this relaxing neighborhood spot. Check it out!\", u\"Good place to watch sports - they turn the volume up. There are 3 tvs and the bar is small enough that every seat has a decent view. There's a good patio in back.\\n\\nWe were lured in by the happy hour specials on a Saturday - $3 bud pints, $5 drafts and wells, $9 specialty cocktails. Food was better than average though unremarkable. They could use a bigger/more diverse menu. Right now it's very simple, though the quality is good.\\n\\nService was excellent even when packed so it gets an extra star. Will be interesting  to see what happens with this place as it's still new.\", u\"Food was all bland and flavorless for the most part. Eggplant po'boy had no seasoning on it -- good concept, bad execution. Really crappy quality bread too. Not worth the carbs.\\n\\nThey have a menu of loaded fries that sounds promising but fails to deliver on so many levels. The sauce on the Mexican style one was flavorless, and the fries themselves look crispy but are actually kind of soft. Not quite soggy though. \\n\\nService was pretty bad. It was super slow when we got in, took forever to get our food, had to flag down the server anytime we needed something. She also wasn't very knowledgeable about food or drinks.\", u\"I've had so many fond memories here. Well not this actual establishment, but in the physical location and space. Tin Kettle had been the Sunburnt Calf, the neighborhood's favorite brunch spot. So it had shoes to fill. Or eggs and bloody marys to fill, rather. \\n\\nWhile I haven't been here for brunch, I've been here for drinks, and a couple of happy hours and I can assure you it does the place justice. The drinks are stiff. The food is good. And the prices are right. \\n\\nI've gotten a couple a different sandwiches here, all of which were solid. Come with fries for a couple of bucks more. Some really good southern style sandwiches. Get those po boys if you love those or go with the chicken. The Dark n Hot and Light n Sweet, were my favorites. The hush puppies are real good and liked the friend pickles. \\n\\nThe drinks are good. They got a full bar. The taps here are solid. If you want a great deal come by for happy hour. Their house beer is only $2 bucks. That's hard to beat. \\n\\nI think place is great all around. See some improvements that could be made, but it's a wonderful addition to the neighborhood and can't wait to see it grow.\", u'Really great burger, shrimp sandwich, and garlic fries. Try the scotch bonnet drink. Chill back patio and good music on the weekends. Glad this place is so near our place!', u\"Hubby and I scored a date night recently and this is where we chose to spend it.  No regrets:\\n\\nThe instant hubby spotted his favorite summer brew, Allagash White, on tap, he was smitten with this spot.  For me, it was more of a slow burn, though I definitely appreciated that there were wine options that came in well under $10.\\n\\nUltimately, it was the Jalapeno Hushpuppies that tipped me over the edge.  These addictive, light, fluffy, warm fried balls of dough have now set the hushpuppy bar for me.  I will never settle for heavy, dense hushpuppies again.   \\n\\nThe Cobb Salad was another winner, with lots of crispy bacon and blue cheese.  We opted to add fried boneless chicken for a few more bucks, and while good, the chicken's crunchy breading got lost with the bacon.  I'd go with the other option of poached chicken if I order this again, since I think the texture would work better.  \\n\\nKentucky Loaded Poutine, topped with (more!) fried boneless chicken, was undoubtably a lot better than your average drunk food, but it was a bit dry and in need of gravy.\\n\\nFried Pickles were the only real clunker of the night, ruined by soggy, greasy breading.\\n\\nVibe here is very friendly and relaxed. In fact, hubby and I made fast friends with one of our fellow diners, perched beside us at the bar.  She turned out to be the bartender's wife (hey,Jessica!).  She enthusiastically recommended the Left Coast Burger, which I look forward to trying when I return.\", u\"Cozy bar with great cocktails. It has board games and I have learned whiskey and Connect Four is a winning combination. Perfect place for a chill evening. The staff is very friendly. Amazing happy hour deals during the week ($3 for a bottle of really nice draft beer!) Can't wait to come back.\", u\"I don't care if you're on a diet -- get the Kentucky Fried Poutine. YOLO.\\n\\nThe drinks are good too, and the bartenders are GREAT, and I love sitting in their garden when it's nice out.\", u'Tin Kettle is a simple place that seems to do a lot of things right.\\n\\nI was able to try the deviled eggs ($6) , Dark N Hot (fried chicken sandwich) (~$10-11), and a Cobb Salad ($11) while I was there. All were extremely well priced and delicious, with the chicken having a great dill/pickle flavor profile. The only slight shortcoming was that the chicken could\\'ve been a bit crispier, but otherwise everything was delicious. \\n\\nI also had a Cucumber Cooler which went down extremely smooth. The most surprising of all was when I tried their house lager (brewed by Saratoga Brewing) and realized its probably the only good \"house\" beer from a bar/restaurant I\\'ve ever had. Considering during happy hour (3-7pm) its a mere $2, this beer is an amazing opportunity to drink cheap and something other than a Genny or a PBR. They have a few other southern oriented beers on tap (Abita, etc.) but I\\'d like to see a little more variety. Their bottle selection makes up for this, though is still fairly standard overall. \\n\\nThe bar tender was extremely nice and helpful and I can\\'t wait to try more of the menu (hush puppies, lots of sandwiches, nat\\'chos, and more fried chicken of course). \\n\\nI\\'m excited to go back and have another tasty dinner for a really affordable price and enjoy the good atmosphere.', u'Great place. Beautiful atmosphere and amazing food!  Love it!!! \\nHighly recommending for lunch and dinner! \\nOutside garden', u'Tin Kettle has a special place in my heart. The staff is incredibly sweet. They\\'re still figuring their shit out though. Drinks were ok. Food was decent. Outdoor patio was beautiful. Music was on point. I wouldn\\'t come back for dinner - the food needs to be better seasoned or more inventive to pass brooklyn standards for \"southern cuisine\". I\\'d come back to try brunch or maybe for a drink and some hush puppies in the patio.'], u'51.Wilma Jean': [u'Chilleeeeeeee. This place, let. me. tell. YOU! I give it a 5/5 for the simple fact the chicken\\'s skin tasted like it was marinated in seasoning before frying. The chicken? Brined to P-E-R-F-E-C-T-I-O-N. Fried like my own family\\'s recipe, so it felt \"homey\" to eat. \\n\\nI really came here for the fried pickles because this place kept coming up as the best in Brooklyn for them, and that statement is correct. The cornmeal bredding was really thick, but not thick enough to overpower the pickle\\'s natural juices. The pickles (in chip form) were accompanied by WJ\\'s buttermilk dipping sauce that I wanted to drown in -- oh my god. \\n\\nThe Mac & Cheese side was pungent and filling with some breadcrumbs on top as a nice touch. The chicken sandwich my friend got was also really juicy and, dare I say, moist. The fries were seasoned with a bit of cajun spice, enough to taste it but not enough to think \"ew 5guys.\" \\n\\nThe space was cutesy, looked a bit gentrified, but thankfully the food and portions were not.', u\"I am a local customer.  The food here is pretty good however this suffers from staff \\nThat are pretty unpleasant to rude. The location is nice with big windows. Seating is hard and uncomfortable. Lighting is terrible The place is hard surfaces and walls and very noisey. Not helped by the slew of hipster permissive parents with three year olds screaming and allowed to run around. \\nIt would be excellent if it did take out so you don't have to sit there and put up with the sensory overload and uncomfortable seating\", u\"Wowwww! Sometimes I bookmark things and forget about them entirely until I see it on Yelp again. Wilma Jean was such a place.\\n\\nI was in Flatiron and hankering for fried chicken (as usual). I had a few choices - go to Bobwhite in ABC City? Nah too out of the way. Go to Hill Country Fried Chicken? The reviews are not so great... or try Wilma Jean in Gowanus? It's right on my way home and it's been on my list! \\n\\nOff to Wilma Jean we went! It's in a great neighborhood right on Smith St, and surrounded by a lot of other solid restaurants. I wanted to order the Chicken Dinner, but they don't allow for all dark meat substitution, so I ordered individual pieces of dark meat and a side of macaroni.\\n\\nMy sister opted for the Thigh Dinner, which came with grits and collard greens. Though I'm not a huge fan of grits, I had a bite of hers and can agree they were pretty tasty! \\n\\nMy entree was huge! The chicken was AMAZING! Tasty, crunchy and fried to perfection. The coating was thick, it reminded me of a cereal dredge! The meat was juicy and salty, the crunch was perfect. One of the most memorial pieces of fried chicken I've had! I would only say the chicken was a little oily. The plate had a layer of oil on it where the chicken was, but nothing a napkin can't dab off! The macaroni had a nice homemade quality to it, and it was extremely cheesey. It was a generous portion for a size too. \\n\\nMy only regret is not having come to Wilma Jean's sooner.\", u\"This place is super generous so come when you're HUNGRY! I got a double cheeseburger and I honestly was not ready for that much meat. I think next time I'll get a single so I can really savor the flavor of the sear plus cheese. Hubs got the fried chicken dinner which he said was awesome. Tots were delicious and I was so glad that's a thing they do!\", u\"Got delivery via Caviar, and I was wondering if this place would live up to the hype?! It sure did!!!! I ordered 2 things to try: the fried chicken sandwich, to which I added American cheese & bacon, and a double cheeseburger, also with bacon! First off, I was gonna go halvsies with my husband on both, so we could both try them. I started off with the chicken sandwich on my own, as I was starving... husband who???? That baby was gone in 2 minutes flat! OMG, it was sooo good! I believe the chicken piece was a boneless thigh. It was so juicy and tender, and thick cut to boot! The coating was crisp and really flavorful! I couldn't tell if it was fried with or without skin (probably without), but it didn't even matter, it was sooo tasty! It also came with a generous amount of fries, which were pretty good too. I added some Old Bay on my own, and they were even better! I was full after the chicken, and a little guilty, so I saved the cheeseburger for him, and he loved it! I had heard nothing but amazing things about their burgers, and they were all true! No frills, no fancy truffle oil or any weird shit, just a good classic burger, made with good meat!  I will definitely return, but not on a daily basis, as it was NOT CHEAP. $51 for the 2 sandwiches to go-no extra drinks or sides. Ouch to the wallet!\", u\"Stopped in for the touted chicken sammidge. It was good - well seasoned, crispy. But very stingy with the buttermilk spread and overall lackluster accompaniments. The housemade lemonade wasn't very tasty.\", u'Yummy fried chicken! Yummy tots! Yummy mac and cheese! Got the fried chicken sandwich. Everything was simple and straight forward and delicious. Exactly what we were craving. Classic !', u\"We were back to Wilma Jean after one year of having left NY and could not wait to have a Double-Burger with Pimento Cheese and Bacon again! ... We were a little dismayed to see that the Double-Burger with Pimento Cheese and Bacon wasn't on the chalkboard anymore. \\n\\nHOWEVER, the SMASHED RED POTATOES, which we had loved so much, and which, at one point, had disappeared from the menu, had reappeared! These are the best potatoes in the world. Forget fries, everything is these SMASHED RED POTATOES, hot to the table. Hot, hot, hot, waxy goodness.\\n\\nI think you can still get something like the burger with the build your own option, but we're too lazy to deal with the permutations. Plus, we had hiked very far to get here and were thirsty and SO ready for the $4 happy hour beers, but when we arrived at 5 or so, we realized that the happy hour was from noon to 4:00 pm (we'd very misremembered the happy hour as being from 4 pm  to 6 pm... or maybe this was just another change since we'd been here last?).\\n\\nNo problem. We went off-road and had the green onion cake wrap. It was an interesting risk after being on the hunt for the bestest burger. It was good, but I wouldn't walk across the city to have it again.\\n\\nBut the re-appearance of the potatoes made up for everything. Thanks for keeping us on our toes, Wilma Jean, we don't mind the surprises!\", u\"Like Superman with Kryptonite, fried chicken is mine and Wilma Jean is like Fortress of Indulgence. There goes my workout out the window but its fried chicken. This casual eatery with shared tables and bar seating. Staff and service is friendly. They have a decent selection of beers to go with the meal. Prices seem reasonable. We decided to sit at the bar as I think it is more comfortable with two.\\n\\nI went with the fried chicken sandwich with tater tots platter. Okay, who can't resist tater tots? My friend had the fried chicken taco. Yes, everything I'm going to write will say fried.... He also got a side of the collard greens. The fried chicken was super crispy and very moist on the inside. It was well flavored and the potato bun soft with a side of tomato, onion and lettuce. The tater tots crunchy exterior, not oily at all. The fried chicken taco had crispy chicken with a buttermilk dressing added a nice tang. I wasn't fan of the collard greens though as it was in a pool of water in the bowl. That said tasted fine.\\n\\nWhile Wilma Jean offers burgers on the menu which I'm sure it is good but with centered on fried chicken why would you? The Fried chicken dinner looked appetizing and I will need to try that next time.\", u'That awkward moment when you dont know whether to give a place 3 stars or 4 because there is no in between...\\n\\n\\nI wanted to like this place more than I did but that was not exactly the case. I ordered the  chicken sandwich and made it a deluxe which included the tatter tots. It was pretty good just nothing notable to me. It tasted too plain to me with just lettuce and nothing else. I asked for the buttermilk chicken ranch sauce to help with the dryness of the sandwich which thankfully jazzed it up quiet a bit. The buttermilk ranch (which is house made) was really good. The tatter tots were regular tatter tots as expected. The chicken itself was pretty good but again nothing notable. The place is cute and very calm. The surrounding area is a beautiful area in Brooklyn and the service was great. This  would definitely be good for lunch or a quick bite but thats about it.', u\"I usually try to stay away from places that boast about being the place with the best fried chicken. I am biased and really believe that nothing compares to my grandmother's...and I know that I'm not alone. \\n\\nSooo why did I come here?? The fried pickles...lol lol. I saw that they had fried pickles and was so excited to try. I also tried the fried chicken sandwich. That I will say was good, not the best ever but still good. My favorite was the pickles of course...they weren't soggy or bland and the buttermilk ranch made it even more yummy.  \\n\\nIf you like fried chicken and aren't particularly picky i say try it...but get the fried pickles too!\", u\"Fried chicken is great!!! Comes out very crispy, hot, juicy and flavorful. One of the most flavorful fries chicken I've had. They have a great chicken dinner meal that comes with a side and a small thing of potato salad. Love their potato salad. It has dill and a bit vinegery. Fried pickles were also very crispy and yummy.\", u\"A good friend of mine recommended Wilma Jean as our lunch spot today. We arrived promptly at 1230... good timing as we had our choice of seats. By 1pm there was not a seat to be had. The place holds about 20 if I had to guest. I went with the deluxe chicken sandwich with cheese,lettuce, pickles and buttermilk ranch. I opted for the tater tots with pimiento cheese and bacon as my side.\\nThe tater tots are absolutely ridiculously delicious...case closed. The sandwich is good not great. I added some hot sauce to the sandwich and it definitely helped. The chicken itself is good, it's a homemade party with white and dark meat. Very tender and moist. If they added more flavor to their reading I think this would be a home run.\\nI wrapped up the meal with their Banana pudding, definitely homemade and worth the cost on all fronts.\\nI enjoyed my meal and will likely go back.\\nMy next 2 hits on the fried chicken front are Commodore and Peaches Hot house.\", u'Ok ok. I happened to be reading over a few reviews of fried chicken spots in BK. \\n\\nI came across a review from a girl wish I could remember her name to give her props.\\n\\nAnyways. I went to Wilma Jean and I must say that the fried chicken was just a shy short of amazing or was it amazing?. It\\'s definitely something I have never tasted before. All I can say is quality all around.\\n\\nI have never had fried chicken that kept the crust on after the first bite without ripping a whole piece of skin out. Wilma Jean had perfected her method. The chicken is crispy all the way through to the end. They put some righteous spices on the chicken that enhances the experience of eating it. \\n\\nOh! That\\'s the word I was looking for to sum up this place. It was a \"food experience\".\\n\\nThe fries were great! Had spices on them too (yum).\\n\\nMy waitress (kadrissa) hope I spelled it right was awesome too. I could order food all day just to look at her. She was very beautiful.\\n\\nThe decor of the place is as most new  Brooklyn restaurants ( hipsterized) just made a new word (ha!). \\n\\nI would highly recommend this place. Absolutely enjoyed my first experience and it won\\'t be the last. \\n\\nChug a lug! Happy eating folks.', u\"Ordered chicken sandwich, okra, and fried pickles for delivery. Okra was burned and the pickles were hard and dry. Plus, I didn't even receive the chicken sandwich. Extremely disappointed.\", u\"This is my first time visiting Wilma Jeans and I must say it's a nice place to dine. Dining is simple, the menu is simple and it gives you a little bit of southern hospitality in the North. I had the famous fried chicken sandwhich with tater tots. The sandwhich was perfectly cooked, not greasy and not too big.  To drink I had sweet ice tea. If you are looking for a good southern meal visit this place. The prices are a little high but for the experience I think it works.\", u\"Decent fried chicken. I had the breast and wing, which comes with ranch on the side. Tasty chicken, except the coating was burnt in places and crumbled off the meat into tiny pieces very easily. There were a few fun sauces on the table, including honey, which I've never had with fried chicken before, but it worked great. Overall, I wouldn't travel far for Wilma Jean's, but am not mad I tried it.\", u\"YUM. While I wouldn't go too far out of my way to go here, but I do appreciate it very much. It's casual and the food is solid. It's clean and comfy inside, so it feels homey. The staff is sweet and friendly. PLUS, prices are cheap. \\n\\nLike I mentioned before, the food is solid. It's simple, but tasty. \\n- Fried Chicken deluxe ($11): deluxe just means adding lettuce, some red onion and tots for an extra $4. The chicken is crispy and juicy, and they use those classic potato rolls for the bun. The tots are exactly as you'd expect - fried to perfection. While it's not the biggest sandwich, they did give more chicken that I was expecting. \\n- Chicken Tacos (2 to an order): literally just cut up pieces of their fried chicken, a little sauce and some herbs on tortillas. There are condiments on the side, so you can add ketchup, mustard, vinegar or honey to top it off \\n- Mac and Cheese: small serving, but definitely cheesy! Had the macaroni been just a little more al dente, it would've been perfect.\", u\"Not a single complaint will go into this wonderful establishment! Friendly people, great ambiance and the food? Look at the next paragraph..\\n\\nFried chicken sandwich will have your mouth and tummy in a different world! I just don't have any other words for Wilma Jean.. Everything is out of this league.. The Tator tots with pimento cheese wasn't my favorite but it was ok with my palates. \\n\\nThe customer service is impeccable and very accommodating.. Seriously there is nothing left to say here. Just come already! \\n\\nUntil next time Yelp Family!\", u\"Ode to sandwich rolls.\\n\\nI've noticed that certain cities rally around a specific type of sandwich roll.  In San Francisco, Dutch Crunch is a classic.  Chicago loves the pretzel roll.  And NYC represents with the potato roll.  Having grown up in Southern California, I had never seen or eaten a potato roll prior to trips to NYC and Shake Shack.  I had mixed feelings about the Shake Shack burger specifically because of the bread.  A potato roll is really soft, and to me, it doesn't seem like a good match with the loose texture of good hamburger patties (though the rest of the Shake Shack burger is on point).  I much prefer the crispy, almost grilled cheese texture of the In-N-Out roll, which is a great contrast with the other elements in the burger.  But like I said, I'm from Southern California, so I have a slight bias.\\n\\nEnter Wilma Jean.  They serve all of their sandwiches on potato rolls, and I happened to eat all three (fried chicken, burger, fried bologna).  Here are my thoughts.\\n\\nFried chicken sandwich was excellent, very crispy, good seasoning / brine with the chicken.  And the squishiness of the potato roll is a great foil to the chicken.  Sort of like in the south, where some places serve fried chicken sandwiches on cheap, soft white bread.\\n\\nBurger was also very good, but I stand behind my feeling of the potato roll being a bit off for a burger.  Funny enough, Thrillist named this one of the top burgers in Brooklyn.  I liked the burger but would put Rose's (especially with that big slice of heirloom tomato in the summer) and Bar Bolinas (Dutch Crunch!!!) ahead.\\n\\nThe fried bologna sandwich was decent, but maybe needed a bit more time on the griddle for the bologna.  Maybe I was comparing it to the fried bologna sandwich I had last weekend in Chicago at Au Cheval (which is less famous than their burger, but a really good sandwich with contrasting textures).  But for $5, can't complain.\\n\\nOn that note, Wilma Jean is a pretty good value.  $7 for a chicken sandwich, $5 for a bologna sandwich.  The burger is $12 including cheese, so about par for Brooklyn.\\n\\nIn short, I'll be coming back for the chicken sandwich.  A lot.\"], u'52.Tom\\u2019s': [u\"Although diners are on the decline in terms of popularity, this is not your typical diner. So, on weekends, expect to wait. Especially, if you have a larger group. This is a diner with MAGICAL pancakes that you will want to come back for again and again. First of all, get yourself a tasty cherry lime rickey - it's perfect. Second, realize that you will get diner-sized portions. DO NOT come here unless you're hungry. An order of pancakes comes with 3 massive, delicious, amazing, fluffy, ... (getting a little bit sidetracked) ... pancakes. My favorites are the Lemon Ricotta pancakes, Danish pancakes (if you want lemon ricotta with blueberries), and the Harvest pancakes (sweet corn and cranberries). Even if I skip dinner, I can never finish an order of these pancakes, but I always get a side of eggs and bacon. When will I learn? \\n\\nThe service and decor are great. Aside from the long lines, I don't have a single complaint or disappointment associated with Tom's diner.\", u\"So was working in the area the other day and saw this in yelp and had good ratings. Also the place has been around forever.\\nSo went for breakfast and have to tell you 2 eggs and potatoes with toast and bacon  should not be $11.00\\nMaybe around the 8.00 range.\\nAlso sat down there was hair all over my table I took a napkin and cleaned it myself it was kind of skeevy that means tables weren't wiped down  from last guest ....\\nSo eggs come out they are over cooked and had brown burn marks on them and potatoes undercooked and beyond salty!\\nBacon was the best part of the meal well done and crunchy.\\n So I had high hopes and I'm sorry this place let me down!!\", u\"Local feel and great food. This place is awesome not only because of it's food, but because of it's people! Their menu is ample as are the food portions! \\n\\nWe tried breakfast and lunch items. A BLT and one of their many varieties of pancakes. We couldn't finish either one and asked for boxes to take it home. \\n\\nRemember it's a cash only joint, but if you forget they have an ATM there.\", u\"I am sitting in the morning at the diner on the corner... :) \\n\\nSo I was in the area looking for brunch before heading over to the Brooklyn Museum. This place has wonderful reviews so I decided to give it a try - and I'm glad I did!\\n\\nI ordered the chocolate cake French toast. I usually don't order overly sweet items on menus but since this seemed to be a popular dish I decided to try it out. WOW! It was so delicious and not overly indulgent. Just the right amount of sweetness for me. I also ordered a side of scrambled eggs and those were good too. My friend had the Dutch blueberry pancakes which were also delicious. \\n\\nMy only complaint about this restaurant is that it's cash only. Really? Come on now... that's annoying. Luckily they have an ATM machine inside. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself isn't too big but I love the decor. Lots of memorabilia with a super quaint and intimate setting. I would definitely return to Tom's!\", u\"Shoutout to the Yelp Brooklyn Newsletter for helping my friend and I find a good breakfast spot last weekend. \\n\\nTom's is a cute little (and I do mean little) diner in Park Slope. It was packed inside, with a line to wait to be seated, so I used that as indication that the food was going to be fire, and boy was I right. The crab cakes and eggs breakfast was slammin'.  The eggs were fluffy and the crab cakes were crunchy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside.  The spicy remoulade sauce it came with was delicious. \\n\\nThey move quick here so the wait wasn't long to get seated, order, and recieve food. The wait staff are both friendly and efficient, and checked up on my friend and I frequently throughout our meal. \\n\\nI can see why this place is so popular, Tom's provides good food in a nice homely atmosphere.\", u\"Just about the perfect neighborhood diner.  Eggs, pancakes, coffee - it's all great and in this warm, inviting setting.  I don't think it's the type of place you should travel very far to go, but it's the kind of place you'll wish you had 10 minutes away.\", u\"Passed this place on my way to the Brooklyn Museum and saw the excellent review for the food, atmosphere, and history. Stepped inside and it was quaint but big enough to fit large groups Once inside there is an ATM to your right and a small bar to your left for the quick grab-n-go or seat yourself crowd. \\n\\nYou stand in a line and moves quickly. The staff waste no time seating people quick fast and in a hurry. When the line grows, well good luck because it goes out the door and they do not take names. You will just have to wait until a table opens up (well at least that was the procedure while I was there).  Now sit yourself down and enjoy the sights and sounds of the diner. The menu has an excellent array of food to offer. Large in portions there was so much to choose from but I was stuck on breakfast. I opted for steak, eggs, grits, and toast. While my family member enjoyed waffle and bacon. \\n\\nOnce the food hit the table I was ready to dive in but wait it had a few drawbacks. My steak was large and in charge but cooked to all hell (I swear I could taste the gristle of the grill on it) but still had flavor and was succulent. Not to mention I had ordered grits not potatoes (it was never corrected in the end), eggs were good and my family member's food was hot (for once)\\n\\n*side bar: anywhere we go we end up always being served last or behind several people who sat down after us this place was no different*\\n\\nEven so, the service was still excellent, friendly, and there is a small outside eating area as well. If I had to recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great neighborhood staple spot to eat at in Brooklyn this would be it. \\n\\nThe next trip I make back to the big and beautiful BK this will be on my list\\n\\nI highly recommend it\", u\"Forget about IHOP and Dennys! This place is king of breakfast food in the neighborhood!\\n\\nThis establishement sits on the corner of Washington and Sterling. It's hard to find the actual name of the store but you can tell you're at the right place by the Coca-Cola Restaurant sign above. Oh yeah, and the long line out the door!\\n\\nIt's a popular place on weekends, especially brunch, but it's worth the wait. \\n\\nThis diner style restaurant has bar seating near the entrance and booths/table/outdoor seating for larger groups. You can tell this place is old by the beat up seats and the many newspaper clippings on the wall. You know a place is good if it's this old and still attracts so many people each week. \\n\\nEverything on the menu is good to order. My personal favorite is the cinnamon roll pancakes! If you're a sweet tooth, try it out! They offer large portions so be ready and hungry when you get here!\\n\\nI would have made Tom's 5 stars if they accepted credit cards. I don't known how many times I've walked by this place and passed up on eating because I wasn't carrying any cash on me.\", u\"Fantastic pancakes, but you already knew that. BF and I shared the lemon ricotta and sweet potato pancakes, plus a side of pork sausage. Everything was amazing (except for the iced coffee, but I shouldn't have ordered that at a diner anyway) and we had plenty of leftovers. Definitely worth the trek!\", u\"Came to Tom's for brunch and thought that it was great. It does get crowded but the line moves progressively quick. Management is very friendly and welcoming. What I like about this place aside from the food is that it has a down to earth vibe. Its great for both families and young people. I am all for a crazy boozy brunch but sometime you just want to eat and relax and Tom's is a good place to do that. I had the Huevos Rancheros and thought that it was really good. I was with 4 other people and everyone enjoyed their food. I honestly have no complaints and I will definitely be returning!\\n\\nFYI this place is cash only!\", u\"Went there this morning from Harlem we drove to BK. At first when we pulled up we couldn't really figure out where it was at but when we realized it was on the corner we knew it was going to be a low key diner style. We ordered 3 different dishes (check out pics) plus 2 'milkshakes which were really good!! \\n\\nYou get a lot of food and the prices are good!!\", u\"Food is gross I don't understand the hype the place smells like cat the plain plain pancakes aren't good the don't have fresh juice only Tropicana orange juice and everything taste bad ..Even the eggs taste bad .\", u\"My fave as far as Diner-y spots are concerned. Everything I've tried has been yummy. The service is super fast and the food is always fresh. I love it! Don't forget it's cash only but they have an ATM in the establishment just in case you forget. \\n\\nI got the Belgian waffle with strawberries and whipped cream and it was perfect. The perfect amount of crunch on the outside with yummy fluffy goodness inside. They also have an assortment of butters which excite me every time they bring them to the table. Last time our butter flavors were Strawberry, Cinnamon, and Pumpkin. Delish.\\n\\nI can't believe this review took so long seeing as though Tom's is one of my go-to's for breakfast and brunch in the area. Better late than never!\", u\"Tom's is like a Brooklyn legend.  I think they have some of the best pancakes ever! But I'm also a breakfast snob.  Service here is usually pretty quick , but you on a Saturday or Sunday, be prepared to wait.  If you are just a party of 2 , you should be seated quickly and if you are a large group, be prepared to wait awhile. Tom's is also cash only so make sure you come with your coins!\", u\"This diner was recommended to me by a fellow Brooklynite who loves pancakes. I came on a Sunday morning at 11 am and found the line literally outside the door. I hadn't been here before so when I tried to go around the line to put my name down, I was told to wait in line and that the wait was only 15 minutes. They don't have a host/hostess so you have to wait in line until you reach the front for a table. While that might sound like an ineffective method to seat people, they do come around with waters and delicious french fries and other various foods for you to sample while standing in line. While we did end up actually waiting 30 minutes instead of the predicted 15 minutes for the table, the wait wasn't bad and the food comes relatively quickly. I ordered the 2 by 2 by 2 special which comes with eggs, bacon or sausage, and pancakes. The scrambled eggs were sub par, but the sausage and pancakes were delicious. The pancakes were just the right amount of fluffiness. My friend ordered the corn beef hash which was also average, it only had potatoes and corn beef in it, and I was hoping for some sort of vegetables to go with it. Some of their dishes come with french fries, which I HIGHLY recommend. Overall service is also average and what you could expect at a diner (although our waiter did forget to bring us water).  I would come back just for the pancakes and maybe try out one of their lunch dishes.\\nJust a tip: if you're a lover of french fries like I am, I would order one of the dishes that comes with it, and it's NOT to be confused with the home fries. Home fries are basically mashed potato chunks.\", u'This joint serves everything, but they\\'re known for their pancakes. I repeat, they\\'re known for their pancakes. So if you find yourself here on a busy Sunday morning, just remember the old adage...\"don\\'t order chicken at a steakhouse\".', u\"Went to Tom's based on Yelp reviews. Service was quick and food was ok.  Corned beef is from a can. It was ok.  Also, didn't realize until after we paid that we were way over charged.  My Corned beef and hash should've been $11.50 and was charged $14.50.    My friend's omelette was $10.50 and was charged $12.50.   Coffee is $3 per cup.  Standard.  But, bitter coffee.   I will not return\", u\"Came here for brunch on a Monday with my bf. Arrived around 11am and luckily there was no wait so got seated immediately. There was a line of people forming sometime after we sat down.\\n\\nI ordered the mango walnut pancakes. It was ok. The pancakes were nice and fluffy with little chunks of mango and little bits and pieces of walnuts scattered throughout the pancake. I liked the pancake batter and the fluffiness but I don't think mangoes go well in a pancake. U only taste the mango if that particular piece you're eating has mango in it. Otherwise, it's mostly just pancake. I thought it would be like a banana walnut pancake where the banana aroma goes throughout the pancake, but it is not so with the mango. \\n\\nMy bf ordered a platter, and replaced the plain pancakes with chocolate chip pancakes for an extra $2. I liked his chocolate chip pancakes better. The platter also comes with eggs, and choice of bacon or sausage, (we asked for both) and we also ordered a side of home fries. We ordered scrambled eggs, and they were fluffy. The bacon was good when it was still hot. Slightly salty but not bad. The sausage was good. The home fries lacked flavor so we drizzled it with ketchup and pepper.\\nThey also have a couple of special spread/butter you can put on your pancakes. There was a cinnamon butter spread which was good. I couldn't really tell what the other 2 spreads were but it was pretty good too. Overall, we had a decent brunch here.\", u\"Coming here is like eating Sunday brunch at Grandma's house. It's a cozy, quaint diner filled with old family photos and memorabilia. Bf and I walked in from Saturday's snow storm craving some fluffy pancakes, and the place was packed. One of the servers precariously carried a tray of hot coffee mugs, cream and sugar for the waiting patrons to warm up with. Even a plate of fries was carried down the line, but bf and I were seated within 10min of waiting. \\n\\nORDER\\n-Chocolate cake french toast w/ whipped cream: This and the cinnamon roll pancakes stood out to me. Chose this bc I was hoping it'd be the same consistency as a cake donut, fried on the outside and soft in the middle. Kind of disappointed, but still pretty good. It's prolly just a week old cake that was buttered and pan fried. A bit too buttery/ salty that I felt weird pouring syrup over the cake, haha!!\\n-Danish pancakes: Bf and I loved the citrusy component and anything with blueberries is good in my book. Included 3 pancakes\\n-2 eggs, french fries, pork sausage sides: eggs were made true to order and everything came out hot and fresh\\n\\nOverall, it's a great local diner to grab a quick breakfast anytime of the day. I would definitely go back to try the other pancakes bc that's what they're known for. Also, brownie points to the staff for keeping the snow-covered waiting customers happy and warm with coffee.\", u\"Danish pancakes were extraordinary. Best I've ever had. Very generous portions at cheap price, at least for NYC brunch. The staff is helpful and attentive and everyone who works here genuinely seems to be having a lot of fun. Such a fun, down to earth place, glad I discovered this gem with the help of all you Yelpers!\"], u'56.Sweet Chick': [u\"This is the second Sweet Chick I ever visited. Didn't disappoint me at all. \\n\\nNo matter the location - everything is still on point. Nice job guys; seriously. This is a must visit and multiple times spot.\", u\"I've been here at least 3 or 4 times and every single time I've encountered a rude, impatient, poor attitude hostess. Seriously, I can't make it up how rude they've been every single time. If you can get past the crappy attitude of the hostess' when you walk through the door, you're in for a real treat. The food here is AMAZING! \\n\\nThe Mac & Cheese is to die for and the chicken & waffles are second to none. The severs are very attentive and make sure you're well taken care of. \\n\\nI wasn't that fond of their biscuit, but everything else I've had has been great. \\n\\nI would give them 5 stars but the attitudes of the hostess during each visit force me to leave 4 stars.\", u\"i came here Saturday night with a couple friends. I was intrigued when I heard Nas is partly behind this restaurant. #top5DOA\\n\\nwe arrived around 8 on a Saturday night and had about an hour and a half wait. luckily you can check in, give them your number and they'll text you when they have a table ready. so we went for a walk and were getting back right as they texted us.\\n\\none friend only had a biscuit - said it was really good.\\n\\nother friend had chicken and waffles, and said for the money she prefers the chicken and waffles at Pies & Thighs.\\n\\nI had the catfish plate. I'm a big fan of catfish and it was the only fish option on the menu. it comes with a spicy (not too spicy) rice concoction consisting of red cabbage, okra and I think that sausage you usually find in gumbo. it was pretty good. the catfish was surprisingly (to me) quite bland though. \\n\\nI was watching my do-re-mi so I didn't opt for dessert or a cocktail. the cocktails were interestingly different, but mostly gin-based. a couple piqued my interest a bit (one with mezcal, beet juice and ginger, and another with blended scotch whiskey and cognac) but just not enough. maybe another time if I return. actually, I would indeed try both of those.\\n\\nit's pretty loud here - the music is louder than most restaurants, mainly 90's and early 2000's hiphop (bonus, but the volume was a curse to my friend who developed a headache.) the loud music then requires the people to also be louder than normal. \\n\\nI'd say it's worth checking out tho.\\n\\nalso, excellent service, btw.\", u'We met up with a bunch of friends from college here for brunch on a Sunday. The hostess was so friendly and engaging, and they were able to seat 7 of us relatively quickly which was impressive. Our waitress was efficient and everyone loved their food. 3 of us ordered the eggs Benedict and some of our biscuits were very burnt. Others ordered the ricotta pancakes and they were AMAZING! Definitely a solid brunch choice and I would love to try some cocktails some day.', u'Not the best chicken and waffle that I have ever had, but it was really good. However, I must say that the chicken was almost perfect. I really wanted more of the chicken. I had the cheddar and bacon and the apple cinnamon waffles. Overall could not taste the cheddar in the waffle and the pieces of bacon in the bacon batter was a little soggy. The Apple cinnamon waffles on the other hand was so much better.', u'Food arrives considerable fast and fresh..i got the fan favorite chicken and waffles with an apples and cinnamon in the batter. I treated myself to an iced tea with bourbon. \\nI was really impressed that the hostess did not insist I sit at the bar because I was dining alone . The chicken was very savory as I left wanted more.  The waffles were crisp and light and I was not interested in using syrup.  \\nThe mac and cheese had me quite tempted so I gave in and purchased an order to go.  My diet starts tomorrow', u\"I absolutely love chicken and waffles but it didn't own up to the hype. I enjoyed the shrimp and grits my friend ordered more. I think the chicken was overly burnt and dry. The waffles were a bit bland and dry. I don't usually add a lot of syrup but for this waffle I had too. The shrimp and grits were amazing. The shrimp was very fresh and the grits were perfectly flavored. I would come back to try other entree dishes but I might have to think twice about ordering the chicken and waffles again.\", u'Great spot for Brunch!!!  The food is absolutely delicious! Our group had the Eggs Benny, Shrimp & Grits and Chix & Waffles with flavored butters... And everything was amazing! Not a fan of their coffee but the peach lemonade was on point! The wait was about an hour and 15 min but it was Williamburg on Sunday so that was expected. Definitely a place to stop in for some good eats!!', u'Great service and food! Waited 20 minutes for a table for 6. Got pork hash, eggs benny, special\\nChorizo grits, biscuit with mushroom gravy, two orders of granola, and two orders of chicken and waffles. All delicious. Hot sauce and syrup on point. The waffles were the perfect balance between soft and crunchy. The chicken was superb and not greasy. The pork was a bit dry for the hash. The granola was well balanced with crunchy granola with soft berries and smooth yogurt. Water was refilled frequently and we were checked upon multiple times for additional requests. Thanks for helping us with our last meal before sending our sister off to her next chapter in her life.', u\"I was so excited to come here with one of my good friends, after reading rave reviews on how delicious their food was. I love me some Southern comfort food so I was already sold. However, when I went there I was told the wait would be about an hour. I was willing to wait. Besides, it was the weekend and I didn't mind waiting for a good meal. After 46 mins., I received a text that said my table was ready. My friend and I scurried back to the restaurant so that we wouldn't lose our spot. We were seated in a tight knit area of the restaurant; to be fair _every area of the restaurant was tight. Which is ok. It's a small, cozy atmosphere. It's work for them. At this point, I was less focused on the architecture of the place and more focused on just eating. I was famished.\\n\\nThe waiter finally came to our table to take our order. My friend and I started with drinks as we continued to view the menu. The drinks were mediocre at best. But the food did not disappoint. I had the Sweet Chick Bucket, which consist of 3 pc Fried Chicken, Buttermilk Biscuit, w/ choice of Mashed Potatoes or Kohlrabi Slaw Slaw. I had the mash potatoes. I also had the collard greens and mac & cheese on the side. Everything was so delectable but I wasn't too crazy about the mac & cheese. It was tasty but I had better. Overall, wait times could be improved but I most definitely recommend their food!\", u\"My sister and I decided to come here for brunch on a Wednesday around 1PM. The wait was only 15-20 minutes, which isn't bad at all. The hostess was very nice! We wanted to switch to an individual table and she kindly accepted our offer. We were seated quickly and a waitress took our order right away. It was such a small but cute rustic spot to have brunch. The food came really fast too! We ordered the Sweet Chick Waffle, Fried Chicken and Waffles, Mac and Cheese and a side of homemade fries.\\n\\nThe Sweet Chick Waffle was covered in fruits and Ricotta. I'm not a big fan of Ricotta but the fresh fruits and the waffle was very good. The waffle was very light, soft and crunchy. It's probably one of the best waffles that I had, other waffles I have tend to be very eggy, soft with a spongy texture.\\n\\nThe Fried Chicken and Waffles is a must try! We had the classic waffle so it was the same as the Sweet Chick Waffle. I like how it came with three flavored butters, which were really light and fluffy. I mostly used the strawberry flavored one. The fried chicken was very crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. I wasn't expecting the fried chicken to be this good! \\n\\nThe Mac and Cheese was too creamy for our liking but once you continue to eat it, you won't stop! Flavor was rich and the shells were cooked just right. I didn't think that my sister and I will finish it but we end up eating most of it. \\n\\nThe home fries were okay, it was in large pieces. There was a strong rosemary flavor. \\n\\nHonestly, this was a lot of food for two people. We were full half way but continued to stuff ourselves. The staff were really nice. My sister and I had a very good experience here.\", u\"I'll keep it short and sweet.\\n\\nGet the chicken and waffles with the bacon and cheese.\\n\\nYou're welcome!\", u\"Simple food done really well. Chicken and waffles are awesome. It's basically an enhanced KFC, but 100 times better. \\n\\nYou must get the grits and shrimp. It'll mess you up (because it's so good). A little pricey, so don't expect to fill yourself to the max.\", u\"Disclaimer: I'm not the biggest fan of chicken and waffles to begin with. With that said, there is nothing special here. A regular piece of fried chicken, a mediocre waffle (even the flavored waffles lacked a punch), and plain jane syrup...$16. I don't get it. But hey, I don't get chicken and waffles to begin with, and sort of think the whole concept is gimmicky - cheap ingredients sold at a high price.\", u\"Let me tell you about this place. It's small and you may have a wait to be seated however, the food was amazing. I had octopus  for the first time and I have to say it was delish... I had the cheddar cheese  bacon  waffle with two wings. The starters were delectable. We had Mac and cheese, the grilled octopus, the pork belly, the  crawfish hush puppies and the cake sliders.. I tell you we were in heaven. Yes his has become a fave! I'll definitely come back!\", u'Fabulous  brunch spot. This place was booming the wait was over 30 minutes  long. But once we got in the service was superb and extremely  fast. That  was one of the Best Chicken &Waffles plates I have ever had. Chicken was perfectly  seasoned and waffles  were just extra good. I will definitely  come back, just during peak hours.', u\"Amazing waffles, solid chicken, and comfortable atmosphere. Gets packed often so go early!\\n\\nWaffles are some of the best I have had, and they come in a variety of flavors. They are super fluffy, and the flavors are well blended into the said waffle (they don't just throw cherries in there if they say its a cherry waffle). Honestly one of the better if not best waffles I have had in my life. The chicken was good. Crispy skin, and I believe a corn meal batter. Well cooked, juicy on the inside. The meat itself seemed a little separated from the skin, and the skin is a little cracker like. Flavor was great on the outside but didn't seem to permeate the inside. Overall a very tasty fried chicken.\", u'Passed by after leaving the Brooklyn Brewery and this looked really good based on reviews and pics here. Wait was about 1 1/2 hrs at 9 pm on a Friday for 4 ppl but we got lucky and a party canceled so we were seated in about 45 mins. \\n\\nI started off with a Sensai on the Block cocktail consisting of tequila, rum, grapefruit and lemon juices with a spicy pineapple gum. Drink itself was good however the heat came on the way of red pepper flakes which was not too pleasant sipping through a straw. For entree I ordered the Nashville hot chicken and waffles. Chicken was crispy, juicy and quite hot which I loved and waffles were also crispy outside and fluffy inside. Everyone else also enjoyed their meals. Excellent spot!', u'I\\'m being nice, so I\\'ll leave 3 stars instead of 2. I\\'m pretty sure Yo Gotti and Nicki Minaj own this spot because they recently made a song about it \"Rake it Up\". This place makes bank for chicken and waffles! You guys smart ;) 17 dollars for 2 pieces and a waffle. Not that I\\'m cheap, I\\'m a ballin type a guy (just look at my chains). \\n\\nOverall, the chicken wasn\\'t so special. KFC & Popeyes definitely got you guys by the sack. However the Waffles and the syrup were good. I recommend the apple cinnamon one. As an appetizer I ordered a Mac N cheese, which was delicious. \\n\\nKeep raking that money guys!', u\"Came here for dinner with 2 friends on a weekend. It was extremely busy and had a few min wait time for the table. Place was dimly lit, loud / lively, congested/tight and smelled amazing lol. \\n\\nStaff were very helpful and patient as he took her time to answer our first timer questions and suggested reccomendations. Pretty much ordered their popular items (Ofcourse chicken and Waffles, Mac & cheese, more fries chicken) and waited a while to get the food. \\n\\nHave to admit the food is delicious but didn't wow me. And for the price point it might asking a bit too much... \\nSo if you're around the area I'd reccomend, but not a place to go out your way for.\"], u'172.Rabbithole Restaurant': [u'Such a cute spot... something out of Alice in wonderland grown up style, of course lol! Treated my brother and his girlfriend & they enjoyed it greatly! The greeter is very courteous and while she stuck to the basic restaurant rules: No Reservations, or seating without your full party on table or at the bar... I have to say the wait was worth the while!!!! Around the table dishes and quotes were- fresh brewed coffee, lush Mamosa, an \"on point Hamburger\", \"perfectly cooked & moist\" Steak & Eggs dish, a \"OMG\"/ silent eating  French toast dish & last, but not least a \"pretty dam good\" Egg Benedict !!\\nShout out to the Cook\\'s in there cute little kitchen cheffing it up! Made it all worth while! \\nLeft satisfied and without any complaints! Till next visit down the Rabbit hole!!', u\"My girlfriend and I came over the weekend for brunch. While the restaurant was packed, we waited only about 10 minutes before we were seated. The yelp reviews for this place were stellar so we were super excited to try the food.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is super cute with a rustic-feel. Service was great and our waitress was accommodating to our every needs despite the restaurant being incredibly busy.\\n\\nI ordered the french style soft omelette with smoked salmon, capers and creme fraiche. The omelette was perfectly cooked, the salmon was super tasty, everything was well balanced. The side salad and potatoes were equally delicious. My girlfriend ordered the stuffed french toast which was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. But it was served with honey instead of syrup, which she wasn't too fond of. We got a couple iced vanilla lattes which were refreshing add ons to our meal.\\n\\nOverall, Rabbithole is a solid restaurant with good service and food. I wouldn't go as far as to say that our meal was stellar or mind blowing. I probably won't be coming back any time soon, but I would definitely recommend this restaurant for others to try.\", u\"Great food and service.\\n\\nChicken La'Orange- braised well and enjoyed the parsnip puree\\n\\nLeek Salad was tasty. Very fresh and loved the bacon and shaved parmesan\\n\\nMushroom Ravioli was delicious and Hangar Steak was excellent.\\n\\nThis is a very nice, quaint and homey little place with a welcoming back patio too\", u'Brunch around 1pm on Saturday. Close set tables but really sweet atmosphere. I want to decorate my studio like the main floor of the restaurant. \\n\\nFriend really liked Chill infused vodka - spicy and tangy equals the ideal bloody. She said, \"Best Bloody Mary I\\'ve ever had\" and she does have a Bloody Mary at every brunch so that\\'s saying something. I tasted fresh tomato juice but who knows. Straight up hot sauce. I admit the smoothness really is something else. Must have! \\n\\nI had lavender infused chai latte - strangely refreshing and I loved it!\\n\\nWe had egg florentine, biscuits, fruit bowl, side potatoes and coffee of course. Everything was great but the notable hero of the brunch was the potatoes. So YUM. I could not leave a single piece behind. \\n\\nPraise Rabbithole Potatoes!', u\"My girlfriend and I stopped by for brunch on a Sunday afternoon and of course it was packed but luckily we were seated shorty. We sat at the back of the restaurant near the back patio and were treated to a the view of sunny skies outside, as well as an awesome chandelier decorated with monkeys! They have a pretty wide variety of food and drinks including alcoholic beverages, coffee, and tea, or a mix and match of the three. On to the food...\\n\\nWe originally came in for brunch so I had to order the french toast. It was between pancakes and french toast, but since I usually go with pancakes I decided to try something a little different this time. It was a hard pick though because everything on the menu sounded really good. We also ordered the croque Madam which I HIGHLY recommend. My gf and I split the dishes and they were more than enough to satisfy our Sunday brunch appetites. The French toast was perfectly sweet, topped with strawberries and stuffed with mascarpone. So fluffy and light but super tasty. The croque madam was savory and the gruyere melted atop the brioche bun blended with the ham and egg in every bite. It was sooo good. I love brunch but don't get to have it too often. Its great to know there are so many dishes I haven't tried here, and Im looking forward to coming back and trying more soon!\", u\"So....Rabbithole, is obviously a pretty cool name and it was definitely a very cool spot. Came here for brunch on Sunday around 12 o'clock. Packed! Two hour wait! Lots of people waiting! However, the brunch gods worked up some miracle, people didn't wanna wait and started leaving, hostess called name after name and 10 mins later, our party of 5 was seated! Talk about an awesome day! 2 hour wait was cut down to 10 mins! \\n\\nLet's get to the important stuff...it's a small but cozy spot, tight seating conditions if 4+ people. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. We ordered some mimosas, coffee and scones, the scones were delicious! They didn't have all the flavors listed on their menu so the waitress picked 3 flavors for us, needless to say they were all just delicious and fresh! \\n\\nI ordered the Eggs Benedict, it was great but this is just preference....it came with bacon instead of ham and I was not a fan of the bacon. The biscuit was also a little too sweet for my taste so the dish was more on the sweet side than savory. However, the overall dish (came with potatoes and a salad) tasted great and was well prepared. My husband had the lamb burger and he LOVED it.\\n\\nDefinitely check it out! Awesome Staff and good food!\", u'This restaurant want a bit hard to find since it was right next to a construction site but thanks to google maps, we found it! This restaurant has a very homey vibe, decorated with antique mirrors, wooden tables and marble tables. I like how there is a big open door connected to the backyard, outdoor seating. We sat at a table right by the door so the breeze that came in was really nice. The customer service was great, our waitress kindly allowed us to move to a bigger table. As for the menu, we ordered their French toast with mascarpone, an eggs Benedict, a Norwegian, a rabbithole Florentine and a side of fries. \\n\\nThe French toast with mascarpone was amazing, especially since it was still warm when we shared it. The toast was soft and fluffy. The mascarpone was very light, which complement the French toast very well.\\n\\nAs for the eggs Benedict, Norwegian and Florentine, they are all served with a side of potatoes and salad. It came in very good portions and were all very good. They potatoes were nicely seasoned.   \\n\\nWe were tempted by the fries after we saw a fresh batch. They were pretty good fries but nothing too special.\\n\\nThis would be good brunch place with friends and family. Definitely try the French toast!', u\"Such a cute little brunch place!!!\\nEverything about this place is so cute and chic! \\nIt may seem small at first glance bc of how the bar is setup, but deeper inside there's a more open space plus it leads to outdoor seating in a beautiful secret garden tea party like theme! Forgot to take a picture of the place, but it feelt so cozy being there. \\n\\nW e were seated pretty fast, but the restaurant wasn't entirely too busy. \\n\\nWe ordered the rabbithole Florentine,  butternut squash soup, lamb burger, steak frites, lox on baguette, and a side of Fruit! \\nThe plating of the food was beautiful. \\n\\nThe rabbithole Florentine was absolutely scrumptious! Very light, but I recommend to pop your yolk before eating it yolkless. The yolk makes the flavor of everything go so well! The side salad it came with was my least favorite. Had no flavor and tasted off. The potatoes were really good though, you can taste the rosemary it's seasoned with. \\n\\nThe butternut squash soup was good, had a hint of a flowery taste. \\n\\nThe lamb burger I didn't try, but my friend that got it said it was just mediocre. \\n\\nThe steak frites were really good, they come with chimichurii sauce and French fries. \\n\\nThe lox was delicious! Came with a bit too much capers for me, but everything else matched so perfectly. It also comes with a lot of dill so I suggest taking one or two of them off!\\n\\nOverall it's a cute place to have brunch. The service is great too!\", u\"Really good food!\\nI have been there twice. \\nFirst for dinner, had the Taglliatelle: the best pasta i've had in my life. Would go back just for that dish.\\nThen went again for brunch. It wasn't too packed and the wait wasn't too long which is always good. Ordered the french toast with a side of bacon, sooo good.\\nAlgo the scones are a must! We tried the blueberry one.  \\nAlso loooove the place, its really cool.\", u\"I am not a regular to the Williamsburg area, but I met up with a friend for brunch today we were told to give Rabbithole a try.\\n\\nOverall I had a great experience. The service was fast and friendly plus the establishment was well maintained with a great vibe.\\n\\nI had the Eggs Benedict with a regular Bloody Mary and would definitely recommended either of them to anyone stopping in.\\n\\nThe only reason I am giving 4 stars is because there are no brunch drink specials and because they ran out of their ice lavender lattes really early (and from what I understand it's one of their 'staples' because it was the one drink everyone recommended).\\n\\nOtherwise I definitely recommend checking out Rabbithole out for brunch\", u\"I really like this place! It's tucked away on the quieter end of Williamsburg, but the food here is amazing.\\n\\nOrdered the eggs benny here and the egg sandwich, both were nicely done. The eggs were runny just how I like it. The bacon has a nice sweetness to it (I think it's maple bacon), and the biscuit the eggs benny was on is also very delicious.\\n\\nService was prompt and prices are reasonable. I was there around 11am and did not have to wait for a table. There was a line by the time I was done, so better get a reservation if you plan to be there noon or after.\", u'Really enjoyed my dinner here last Saturday night! We sat in the backyard and it was a really nice space. I started with the Jar Fly cocktail, which was a super refreshing gin cocktail and also got a glass of their  Sauvignon Blanc, which was a little too sweet for me. \\n\\nFor dinner, I had the Taglliatelle; the ricotta was amazing! Overall, a really nice pasta dish. I felt the portion was perfect for the price. \\n\\nThe service was fine - no complaints there. Would love to try the brunch, which seems to be their main attraction.', u\"Quiet, laid back bar with friendly bartenders and good food.\\n\\nRabbithole is tucked between the M and L train lines, which seems to result in a slightly smaller crowd. I've found a seat going in on a weekend or a weeknight.\\n\\nThey always have drink specials and Lambrusco is around for summer. I always order the steak. The cut is always lean and served with charred broccoli and some potatoes. \\n\\nCheck out the backyard during the warmer months.\", u'Stopped here for brunch on a wkday and was seated right away. Mightve been the time i got here around 11:30am, it started getting crowded after i took a seat.\\n\\nOrdered the norweigan eggs benedict and coffee. I like the fact that all the condiments (ketchup, tabasco sauce x3, salt and pepper, sugar) was already on the table. Its nice to see tables set up like that.\\n\\nMy food came and the reviews were right!!! The eggs benedict was served on crunchy muffins and NOT AT ALL soggy! Stillw ondering how they pulled that off. And OMG the potatoes--dont get me started. Those were THE most seasoned potatoes i have ever eaten. Im usually not a fan of potatoes and most of the times barely even touching it when served as a side on a dish. But i couldnt help it becos the potatoes smelled so good and after one bite i just kept going! The salad though--coulda went without it, maybe dressing was too light, couldnt taste much\\n\\nI think this place is a solid place for brunch and id definitely come back.\\n\\nService was great also. The girls all had such cute accents.', u\"This restaurant is literally just downstairs from my best friend's apartment...and somehow I managed to never eat a meal there until this past weekend. I've heard good things from my friend, and obviously read other such pleasantries about Rabbithole's food via the Yelposphere, but never felt the gravitational pull of this place, and that's probably a pity. \\n\\nI woke up on a Saturday morning to a very loud tummy grumbling and decided to call down for a quick breakfast that I could pick up and resume my vegging in bed. \\n\\nI went ahead and ordered the egg sandwich which comes with their breakfast potatoes, served on their homemade brioche--this is a small omelet with swiss, tomatoes, spinach and tomato jam-- I added caramelized onions because why wouldn't I?\\n\\nAnyway, my overall experience with this breakfast takeout was great. The sandwich was done really well, but I must admit the onions made it a bit of a sloppy mess...this wasn't an issue for me. The potatoes were packed with herbalicious flavor, but my one complaint is regarding the tomato jam. This didn't do very much for me, but tasted kind of like a flavorless salsa/pureed tomatoes without anything added. Just saying...they should steal the tomato jam recipe from Clinton Street Baking Company. \\n\\nBeyond that...I'm sure that Rabbithole has plenty to offer that's delicious, and I plan to come back and find out what those things are! The interior is casual...lots of exposed brick and wooden tables create a laid back vibe.\\n\\nMissed opportunity: Saw a boozy chai on their chalkboard out front sounded yummy\", u\"Came here for brunch with my boyfriend yesterday. Beware, the lines can get pretty long, but they move quickly enough. When we were seated, we opted to be placed at the community table in the back since it is outdoors in a patio area. We shared three plates (don't judge us, one shouldn't have even counted as an entree): the avocado toast with soft boiled egg, radishes, and heirloom tomato, the rabbithole florentine, and the croque madame. I also asked for a lavender iced latte on the side. The rabbithole florentine was my favorite. I am not vegetarian, but don't always seek meat in my meals. This hollandaise was very creamy, and the caramelized onions were cooked perfectly and avoided that slimy or raw crunchy texture. I really thought I took a risk ordering it! The side potatoes were surprisingly crispy and expertly seasoned with salt, pepper, and rosemary. The croque madame was delicate for a sandwich, with only moderate amounts of bechamel, ham, and cheese. The egg was a little firmer than I'd have liked, but delicious nonetheless. Avocado toast is what it is, but they really dress it up here and it tasted great. You must order the lavender iced latte, whatever you do. One of the best tasting coffee drinks I have ever had (alcohol free, by the way).\\n\\nThe service was just okay, they tried taking my plate from me twice while I was still eating but it was understandable as this place is SUPER busy. \\n\\nAll in all, I know I will return here several more times. Truly a gem. Glad I live a few blocks away!\", u\"I was excited to try the food here. I came here for brunch and ordered the Rabbithole Egg Florentine. It looked really tasty but, to me, it was average. Something I'm sure I would be able to find somewhere else. However, I did enjoy the home fries. They had a distinct taste and was mouth watering. I also had the Chai which is all home made. If you're a coffee lover, it's worth a try. Overall, this place is okay. I would probably give it another chance and order off of the regular menu.\", u\"Viva and I came here after a dance performance and long stroll through Greenpoint, leading into Williamsburg. The food was DELISH!!!!! We have the lavender kaiser rolls with honey butter (to die for...) and tuna crudo, I have the veggie burger (it's white bean now, and so savory) and she had the real burger with a side of fries... we were both in heaven and it was ridiculously good! I think we got the mussels, too, which I was OBSESSED with the sauce... \\n\\nCome here for a date, friend date, whatever--amazing! And our server was awesome, too :)\", u'We came here for brunch and had an amazing time. The restaurant is popular but still chill, and there is a forearm area in the back. The food here is DELICIOUS and the coffee is good. I highly recommend the grain bowl!', u'Best brunch spot- French toast is to die for!! And the cocktails are always great! Dinner here is light, filling and amazing!'], u'34.Tam\\xe1': [u'Fresh and tasty,\\nA sane and friendly spot to have a healthy meal,\\nWhat we had was so delicious, and had original tastes.', u\"I did not know what Filipino food tasted like before Tama. Now I do. It tastes kinda like Chinese food. My go to is the Bicol Express which is super-thick pork belly cuts drenched in some sort of sweet and savory sauce. Yum. Popcorn chicken, meh.\\n\\nService is quick. The guy working register is super nice. Delivery guy is kinda weird though. So I usually just pick up my food.\\n\\nIf I have to complain about anything, it's the bok choy. THEY'RE IN EVERY DISHES EVERYWHERE. I HATE SUPERFOOD CAUSE THEY'RE SO OVERRATED.\", u'Ordered the lumpia shanghai eggrolls dunno what the dipping sauce was but it was like a sweet mang tomas SARAP (tastes good), ordered the chicken adobo bowl the chicken thigh was perfectly roasted but juicy, didn\\'t care for the roasted scallions but it was probably for flavor versus to be eaten (think ginger you can\\'t bite a wad of it but instead it flavors the dish well), and lastly ordered the season veggies pancit which was the most unfamiliar flavor but it worked! The green & yellow zucchini were my favorite veggies and of course adored the use of two types of noodles! \\n\\nTo drink we had Calamansi juice and a lychee aloe drink. Could totally go for a \"Red Horse Beer\" to wash it down. Perhaps in the future?\\n\\nPlace is 5 months new, simple menu with great ambiance, presentation and vibrant character!  Staff was super friendly and met Chef JR who was super cool.  Will need to go back for dessert!!!\\n\\nANG SARAP TALAGA, tikman tama  it tastes really amazing, give it a taste it\\'s spot on!!!', u\"It was nighttime and my bestie and I are driving looking for a juice bar. Nothing was opened but we passed by this place, saw the menu on the blackboard and had to park and go in out of the curiosity. It had opened just a few weeks ago. \\n\\nThis is casual quick service spot, but it's one of my new favorite takeout places in Brooklyn. Every bite is an oh my god moment. The decor is fun and they put this sea salt that is amazing on almost everything. I've had the beef tongue and the bicol express - both which are amazing. They have accommodated me and switched out the rice for veggies, which are always perfectly cooked. The maja, which is more of a mousse than a custard is so flavorful I can't help but order it every time. \\n\\nThe owner and chef are extremely friendly and happy to share about the food, the neighborhood and just about anything.\", u\"Tam\\xe1\\nNY BK BedStuy\\n5pm Wednesday 19th July 2017\\nFive Stars\\n\\nIt's a brand new place serving up some classic Filipino Food in a small but cozy space. The music was some down beat hip-hop. The service was friendly and great. It gave me a great explanation of the food. I decided on the Chicken Adobo ($11 + $2 for an egg). The chicken was confit-ed and then broiled. The rice was fried with the soy vinegar chicken marinade.  The egg was fried and not soft boiled. Overall, the food was delicious. However, the service was even better.\", u'Awesome new Filipino spot in Bed Stuy, with standing room only and a single bench for enjoying well-done versions of some staple dishes.\\n\\nStart with the Lumpia over the Popcorn Chicken and definitely try the delicious Pancit Bowl. The Adobo Chicken was also great.\\n\\nI would definitely come back for a quick snack.', u'Food is on point. Flavor is packed. \\n\\nThey are nice to my dog. \\n\\nMaterials are good for mother earth. \\n\\nAlways would recommend to anyone looking for a healthy and delish jam in Bed-Stuy.', u\"Thank you...can't stop ordering the beef tongue! So nice to have an awesome food place in this neighborhood.\", u'Nice find! Chicken adobo really nice flavors, and textures. Will be back to check out rest of menu.\\n\\nNot sure why no drinks/seems like easy way to make extra cash/only suggestion!\\n\\nServer sweet/attentive', u'I would say 3 stars because im a filipino food purist , i grew up with these dishes . I want some nostalgic flavors that are only unique to filipino dishes . It has some good twist of new flavor . They use compostable materials in terms of silverware and bowls . Which i think was amazing . Thats why i give it a 4 stars ,Because thats some efforts right there . I hope they have more selections of drinks or beers .', u'i was expecting a bit more from tama chicken adobo was good, clean flavor but also a bit plain and boring', u\"First, let me say how much I LOVE that they use compostable take-out containers.  My number one reason for avoiding take-out is that it's terrible for the environment and I hate eating hot food out of plastic. This is the only place I've seen in the neighborhood (one of the few anywhere) to make an eco-friendlier choice.\\n\\nNow, the food.  It's delicious! I've only tried the pancit and the fresh lumpia because I don't eat meat.  Both were fresh and flavorful.  The noodles were light and the veggies perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The fresh lumpia was a spongy crepe filled with fresh fruit and veg - an interesting twist on Filipino food. This is my new go-to place when I don't have the energy to cook. My only wish is for them to expand their vegetarian offerings (Please, if you're reading this, please!)\", u\"Review is only for the lumpia!\\n\\nThe lumpia is $6 for 3 pieces!! Was expecting a few more at least. And it wasn't as crispy on the outside as I would've liked. I'll try this place out again for the other stuff since I don't know any Filipino food in the area but I'm never getting the lumpia again.\", u\"I badly wanted to like this place. Was looking for something new on my way home. Found this place in yelp and with the great reviews decided to give it a try. Ordered two meals to go at the counter and waited. And waited and waited some more. I'm the end I ended up with g a full hour for my food. An hour...for takeout. It was simply outrageous and upsetting. Oh and it was Tuesday night not even Friday or Saturday night. The food took so long that I actually couldn't eat it until the next day became was running late to meet up with some friends. I was hoping that the food would have been worth the wait but it wasn't. My bf got to eat his the same night. He got the Adobo chicken and texted me that it wasn't worth the wait. I ate my mackeral the next day and it didn't even come close to be worth the wait. Maybe I caught them in an off night but with the lack of food quality I really can't give them a second chance.\", u'Love the food here with a different twist to Filipino food. It is a great place for friends to hang out and chill. The restaurant also have delivery and brunch. I love the pancit here because it is packed with so much vegetables. You can ask them to not put eggs in your dish if you want. I wish they could get there liquor license soon.', u\"Can't go wrong with chicken adobo with egg on that, this place hits the spot for quick healthy eats that are proper!\", u'I loved the noodles. The service was so friendly and attentive. Seems like the owner is very happy to please.', u\"Eat here! Great ambience! Good food! Fast and friendly service! Biodegradable plates and cutlery! It's amazing!\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I stumbled on this place in our neighborhood on it's 17th day open. Everyone we talked to was nice and helpful. They really wanted us to enjoy our experience and we truly did. Ordered their housemade Calamansi Limeade, Popcorn Chicken, Lengwa, and Adobo Chicken. All of it was super flavorful and the portion sizes are great! I'm telling all of my friends about Tama.\\n\\nThis is going to be my spot. I can't wait to try the whole menu again and again and again. Well done.\", u\"Great restaurant! Filipino inspired cuisine! I eat noodles and mackerel with coconut rice, it was delicious. Banana ketchup also great!! I will really recommend this place either to eat in the restaurant or to take away! \\nAnd don't forget the the to try maja dessert! It melts in you mouth (*\\xb4`*)\", u\"The good: fantastic food, crazy cool Filipino flavors and freshness, among the best pickup/delivery restaurants in the area. (Also the delivery person is super fast)\\n\\nThe bad: High prices for small portions.\\n\\nBasically, this is the best delivery around. The only downside is you might find yourself hungry an hour later if you're a person with a big appetite.\"], u'159.Cafe At Your Mother-in-Law': [u\"I'd heard about this place on our local radio station back home in San Francisco; I was quite intrigued: Russian cuisine mixed with Korean? And as I'd planned a trip to New York for the next week, I quickly yelped and bookmarked it. \\n\\nThis place is quite a trip: literally. It's in Coney Island and it was almost an hour-long ride on the subway. Luckily, I got a table right away; it was a Sunday afternoon at 3pm, so I was right in between the lunch and dinner rush...and according to my fellow Yelpers this place gets busy. \\n\\nSpeaking of my fellow Yelpers: I used the subway ride to study their reviews and by the time I got to restaurant, I knew what I wanted. I ordered the eggplant salad and the kuksu. Kuksu is somewhat similar to Vietnamese ph\\xf2, however it is served cold. Honestly, I'm not a big gazpacho fan, and so the thought of cold soup somewhat turned me off; but I'm a good adventurer at heart and wanted to at least give it a try. \\n\\nBoth dishes were quite delicious. The eggplant salad has a Mediterranean taste to it, in my opinion and the soup was...well...I can't really describe it but it was really tasty. \\n\\nOverall, I'm very happy with my trip out here and i really recommend it. It's also good to read up on the history on why people of Korean decent end up in Uzbekistan.\", u\"I'm a fan of combination fusion cuisines that sound completely implausible and made up.  Icelandic-Ethiopian?  Japanese-Turkish?  Sign me up. \\n\\nKorean-Uzbek is one of these in my mind.  But apparently, there's a whole history of Koreans migrating to Uzbekistan (thanks Wikipedia), and a whole culinary category was spawned.\\n\\nThe place is diminutive, and service is rather relaxed, if efficient.  I saw only 2 people working the entire restaurant.  But, if you are willing to wait it out,  you're in for quite a treat.  The menu options are rather diverse, and the food is separated into cold and hot sections.  The cold plates resemble the dishes you've seen in a banchan offering at Korean restaurants, minus the pungent sesame oil.  The hot dishes are heavy on meat and rice options, or soup options with noodles.  Bf and I shared the traditional disc shaped bread with Eggplant hye - a cold chili sauce doused salad of silky eggplant chunks with carrot strings, which we found quite delicious.  I had the fried basa with mashed potato, and Bf tried the Lagman, a beef stew with noodles.  My fish was heavy on the eggy batter but seasoned nicely.  We enjoyed our dishes. Good, comforting food without any pretension.  The portions were surprisingly large for the prices. \\n\\nAll in all, I'm pleased with my Korean-Uzbek experience.\", u\"We almost became regular at this place after our 1st time few weeks ago when we enjoyed the delicious food. However, NEVER AGAIN after our second and last visit last week, it was a nightmare. The waitress was rude, no customer service skills at all. Kept restricting us drinking our lemonade even though neighbors at other table were drinking their own beer bottles. Our khe fish had thick black long hair inside. When I pointed it to the waitress you will not believe what she said.\\nShe asked if the hair was inside the dish when she brought it or it appeared there somehow from somewhere else afterwards. Shocking question. She did not apologize or offered anything as compensation. Opposite she acted as if it's our hair and nothing happened. I was paralyzed with poping balls eyes and couldn't make sense of what she's asking and simply said look at my fair thing short hair that braided tightly to my head. Even if they were black they will never fall out of a braid. How could it appear from somewhere else if only me and another almost bold man is sitting at this table....I also looked at the kitchen and saw 2 cooking ladies that had exact same hair as in the plate and they weren't in a hat or even clipped hair. Their hair were all over the place fluffy falling. What??? Cooking in the kitchen having hair open ??? Embarrassing horrible service. STAY AWAY. They don't know what common sense and respect is. They are lacking any interpersonal and hospitality skills.\\nFood is ok even tasty but when you get rude owners and waiters you don't care how delicious they cook if they are nasty, you better go somewhere else where hospitality and respect is #1 priority. Simple as that.\", u\"Opposites are meant to attract.  \\n\\nKorean Uzbek cuisine??? What? \\n\\nHaving never ever tried uzbek cuisine, I'm not even sure what my expectations are. But I was very intrigued by the Korean fare offered. \\n\\nThis review based on one visit, 3 dishes. \\n\\nEggplant salad: soooo good. You don't tire of eating it. Perfect balance of saltiness and tartness. \\n\\nKuksu: korean cold noodle soup. Refreshing. Surprising. Vermicelli rice noodles, beef, Cucumber. I thought I would hate this but really, I was impressed. Light fare. Different sizes offered including a small for $5.50! Steal \\n\\nManti: lamb dumplings. Good meat quality. But nothing special. \\n\\nBottom line: Uz-bek I'm coming back! Went home and at leftovers same day :)\", u\"Cafe At Your Mother in Law feels like you're eating at your mother in law's, if your mother in law happened to be a serious looking Korean woman who speaks Russian and lives on Brighton Beach. Restaurant is bare bones with plain tables and chairs. It was packed when we went on Sunday evening and the staff seemed overwhelmed. Nonetheless the food was excellent. \\n\\nI had the the Kuksi soup and it reminded me of a Ramen style soup but can be eaten hot or cold. I chose the cold option for a hot summer day and it was good and refreshing. Also, these guys do magical things with cabbage. Their Kimchi is great and their stuffed cabbage with meat is also a winner. While waiting for a long while to have our order taken my friend grabbed a sweet vinegar cabbage salad right out of their fridge. They didn't seem to mind as the atmosphere is very very casual. This made our long wait bearable. Their Samsa was alright but not amazing. \\n\\nI will definitely be back for their soup and salad but will come at a less hectic time of day.\", u\"Delicious! Affordable and tasty. The cabbage and beef stuffed buns were delicious. The pumpkin buns tasted like... pumpkin. *gasp* (Not processed and stale!) The Russian tortellini was rich, yet refreshing. I live for fresh dill, so I ordered some to-go. The lagman soup had a great flavor, but I was disappointed in the lagman. They did not seem like they had been pulled.  The food was an amazing experience. But, the service was lacking. The server was caring for the whole restaurant, so I understand that they were busy; however, it still took a while to get them to come over. (But once we did order, the food came out promptly.) There was a $7 charge for my to-go item, which was slightly disappointing considering that was the cost of another bowl of soup. Overall, worth it! Just make sure to speak up, and don't plan on taking anything home.  I'll definitely be back!\", u'Located on a side street just off the main strip of restaurants along Brighton Beach Ave, this place is a tiny hidden gem! \\n\\nThe food is outstanding with something for everyone. They offer a mix of Korean, Russian and Eastern European Euro-Asian dishes including typical soups with noodles, Kim chi and spices. Here is a variety of salads, both dill and regular, at treasonable prices. They have many meat dishes including dumplings.\\n\\nService can be a little slow especially when the small place is packed and only one person is serving. They are, however, kind and responsive.\\n\\nGetting a table may require a wait. The crowds are heavy on weekends and especially after a beach day. \\n\\nI strongly recommend trying it out!', u'Absolutely amazing food. We got the kuksu hot, fern salad, lamb kebab, bean sprout salad, and one of the dumplings and a pot of tea. The flavors are so rich and delicate here.', u\"Really good food. Tasted like homemade, I enjoyed it very much. Prices are really good too.\\nBut don't expect much from the place, ambiance is related to the price range.\", u\"Great value for exceptionally tasty food. My group shared so many different dishes, and as a newcomer to this cuisine, I was amazed at the variety, from cucumber salad to potato pancakes with tomato, to pumpkin samsa, to spicy eggplant salad. The sodas (from the country of Georgia) can't be skipped.\", u'Apparently, a lot of both North and South Koreans moved to Uzbekistan, which was part of the Soviet Union, during the 20th century, and now Uzbek-style Korean food is a thing. \\n\\nLong story short, on a hot summer day, I enjoyed a bowl of cold \"kuksi,\" a beef soup with noodles and vegetables, and a dish of hot peppers to season it to taste. The waitress said it\\'s \"it\\'s Korean food, but not from Korea.\" On the Russian side, they serve a nice non-alcoholic compote, like a fruit punch, to drink. It\\'s very tasty, but a little pricey at $4.50 for about 8 oz/237 ml. \\n\\nA lot of Yelpers write about them microwaving their food, but that wasn\\'t a problem when everything was served cold. The soup was delicious and very filling, and the menu (in Russian and English) looks so interesting that I want to go back, and soon!', u'A hidden gem on Brighton beach! My coworker who is partly Korean has shown this place to me. Their kuksi soup (which I prefer hot- you can have it cold as well) is unique and delicious. One bowl of soup is enough to get full. Order it with their national bread - lepyoshka (I usually get a half) and tea. I also like morkovcha spicy salad and funchosa with meat (but they have plain version as well). Great place for lunch! Highly recommend.', u'My partner and I enjoyed a low key day at the beach, which was perfectly topped off with this delicious, cheap, Russian-Korean food. Clean, reasonably priced, with a 50 Cent music video playlist on the tv. Will be back.', u\"I love that there's an Uzbek restaurant run by a Korean woman who only speaks Russian. That's so dope. Also dope? The food she slings out in large portions are reasonable prices. The two of us shared one samsa, one manti, one stuffed cabbage, one korean warm soup thing (wish I could be more specific) and their bread. It was way too much food and we'd spent maybe $32 between the two of us. We could have easily spent $20 and had enough to eat.\\n\\nI thought the best dishes were the stuffed cabbage and manti. The samsa was a little bland and the korean soup was good, but not up to how good the other dishes were.\", u'My Korean friends from Uzbekistan took us here to show is the joys of Korean Uzbeki food. We ate almost everything on the menu, there were six of us so we could try it all! My favorites were the hanum and the samsa. Lots of other dishes were great too, and try the kompot to drink.', u\"A great local eatery. My boyfriend and I tend to explore and try different ethnic foods. Located in the bustling area of Brighton Beach, there are so many Uzbek and Russian restaurants. It's difficult to really know what this restaurant is unless you know how to read their awning... It was quite busy on a lateSaturday afternoon (3pm). Customers were coming and going, seemed very popular. We ordered manti, hansu and braised cabbage.\\n\\nThis place could've gotten 5 stars but I was turned off because when the food arrived, it was warm (almost cold) and not hot. Our food seemed to take a really long time to come, compared to other customers who were seated and ordered after us. The manti's look like xiaolongbaos, but were so different. The skin was more doughy and chewy and the filling was unlike asian dumplings. These were filling itself. The braised cabbage was fillied with meat and rice. This was so good. The sauce on top was tangy. Hansu is dough filled with shredded potato and also topped with the same sauce from the braised cabbage. Both these dishes were lacking excitement, like maybe some spice or pepper and salt. \\n\\nIt tasted very homecooked and was a hearty meal. I would come back again! I wish their menu was more descriptive so I know whats in each dish.\", u\"This is a neat place. One thing I didn't find very good was the seaweed salad and bread. I normally love seaweed salad. What I did like was the Fish Kimchi type dish. And I liked the fruit drink....which was supposed to be a Compote like drink but not sure if it was truly all natural or not. I would go back here, it was a neat place.\", u'My husband and I went here for lunch, after hanging out on the beach, and quite frankly this place surpassed our highest expectations. The food (eggplant salad, pumpkin samsa, spicy carrot salad and some potato dish) was great and the staff was friendly & helpful. The samsa was perhaps the most impressive part of the meal, and the pumpkin stuffing is a really nice touch. One thing that one needs to keep in mind is that the mandatory service fee of 10% is applied and we were not made aware of this policy beforehand.  On the bright side, there are many vegetarian and some vegan options.  Overall, I would recommend this place for a quick bite if you are in the area.', u\"Looked forward to eating at this spot. Food adventure! However it fell short of my standards. Mostly due to the food being microwaved. I can understand the food being authentic which I felt that it was, but come on man! You can't microwave food and let that be a representation of your establishment! Service was meh! I had to call the wait staff to take our order and call them to get a box To-go and for the check! For microwaved food it was good. It was an experience and I will not be coming back.\", u\"I filmed a segment of my Travel Vlog here recently, and loved the experience from start to finish. This gem is located about 1 block from the main strip on Brighton Ave and you would probably miss it if you did not know where to look.\\n\\nAt 3 PM on a Monday, we practically had the whole place to our selves. I tried the Kuksu (cold soup with beef, noodles, and veggies) to start and it was delicious. I wish I was eating it today with this humidity! My brother tried the borsch and from his reports it reminded him of St. Petersburg.\\n\\nFor the main courses we split the Uzbek Plov and Manti. The Plov was beef and a little lamb with rice and veggies. I thought the beef was tender and cooked just right. The Manti (dumplings) were amazing! Seriously, worth coming here alone for them.\\n\\nI want to come back here to try a few more of their samplings the next time i'm in Brighton Beach. Maybe i'll bring my Ukranian parents!\"], u'64.Chuko': [u\"Went here on a weeknight didn't have to wait for a table but based on how good this ramen was I'm expecting that to change. \\n\\nGreat service, really delicious food! Will be back for sure.\", u\"I hope they didn't shut down, because the place has been closed in the evening the past week or so. It's new, so they might be having trouble finding customers. The location is not ideal for business because it's tucked away in a residential area.\\n\\nStill no liquor license, so the San Pellegrino will have to do for now. They ramen is very good, the summer specials are quite good as well. I really like the pork buns. The gyoza was meh, though.\", u\"Chuko is a pretty new spot and at the time I wrote this it didn't have its liquor license. This is why I can't give it 5 stars. \\n\\nIt has a great atmosphere and the service was excellent. The food was great. Mostly ramen with some tasty little appetizers. \\n\\nI had the kimchi ramen with pork. Delicious. Spicy. Filling. Everything you want from good ramen! \\n\\nI would have loved to linger in this place with a nice beer and soak up the atmosphere but without the liquor license it's really a sit down / eat / leave kinda place. I'd love to go back and try it when it is fully functioning. They did say their license is coming soon.\", u\"I'm really glad this place decided to save $ by keeping the old bodega / whatever shop sign out front. Great job on the kitsch, team. \\n\\nOtherwise you're being offered a $15 bowl of extraordinarily ordinary (not bad) ramen. It is underwhelming. Oh, and you need to pay extra for chili oil. Yes. You do. I'm sorry, no amount hand crafted artisanal nonsense should convince anyone that this is anything other than an insult. \\n\\nIf you feel like paying hype prices for the ordinary, be my guest. No, thanks.\", u\"A solid ramen place in a neighborhood that lacks Japanese and Asian food in general. I really wish this had opened earlier. I've never been to the other location, so this was my first time. \\n\\nMy favorite kind of ramen to get at all places is tonkotsu, but unfortunately, they don't have tonkotsu, so I went with the closest thing--pork bone broth ramen. You can also choose your meat topping and between hard or soft egg. I went with roasted pork and a soft egg. I really love the vegetable that came in the bowl (not sure what it was), and the pork was definitely melt-in-your-mouth. The egg threw me off because I thought it would be soft boiled but I think it may have been poached? It was overall very liquidy, even the white part. The broth, of course, didn't have that thickness and heaviness of tonkotsu but it was pretty good. Overall not 5-star *amazing* but good enough for 4 stars!\", u\"Felt like you're paying for overpriced ordinary ramen. Ramen was a bit bland and nothing to write home about. We got pork buns as well but the portion size was so small and they charge $5 per bun...\", u\"Their pork bun makes me lose my mind it's so good and savory and spicy. Awesome ramen, too.\", u\"I was excited to check this place out as there are very few places that serve ramen in my area.  I had the pork bone ramen with garlic chili oil.  The broth was on point, the chashu was flavorful and the noodles were exactly how I like them.  I was a little scared about how it was going to taste since I ordered it to be delivered, but it came fairly quickly considering the distance and the broth was still hot.  The delivery did come with instructions that recommended heating up the broth before incorporating it in.  One of the better ramen soups I've had lately.. it was very satisfying.\", u\"My favorite ramen spot has opened a new location closer to my home. There is a god!!!!! \\n\\nHands down...the best ramen in Brooklyn. The shrimp buns are a personal favorite. And the Kimchi ramen is heaven in your mouth. \\n\\nWay to go, guys!! I'll be back about every week...lol.\", u'Delish.  Generous portions, great staff and cozy venue.  I ordered their pork broth and my brother got the kimchi, both were solid but if I had to choose I liked mine a bit better.  Reasonably priced compared to Ichiran and Ippudo.  Liquor license was still missing and no BYOB and the apps were a little salty for me but other than that my go to ramen place in BK.  Would return to try other versions.', u\"It's lit, fam. Convenient near the JMZ trains, and consistently delicious food. The small plates are well thought out and make for a great warm-up for the main event. The wings and shrimp bun are musts along with the kale salad.\\n\\nI've had every broth and each one has its merits. The soy broth is light but loaded with umami, the chicken bone broth is given a little shine with lemon, and the tonkotsu broth is like a hug from Grandma.  Noods are always on point, never mushy or under done. \\n\\nIf you are new to ramen or a junkie like me, Chuko is a must-try. Again. And again.\", u'Very good ramen, but perhaps slightly overpriced. Nice relaxed atmosphere, but they do not currently serve alcohol NOR do they let you BYOB, which is pretty annoying. They also said they\\'d have their license \"soon\" in May. It\\'s now August.', u'Stepping into a 15 dollar ramen place, you expect it to be at a 15 dollar ramen level but this place was a let down. If you are a ramen lover and have been to the top spots, this may not be worth the stop. The broth was just okay, pork was just okay and everything cost extra on top of the 15 dollar bowl of ramen - 50 cents for chili oil was the cheapest option. \\n\\nThe service was good, the space was nice but the food not worth it. Also they currently do not serve alcohol, kind of a let down of a date night.', u\"New branch near Myrtle/Broadway. The interior is nice. Got some painted walls. No liquor license yet (as of the week of May 5th.) they said they're getting it soon, though. Ramen was really, really good. Very veg friendly.\", u\"I've lived in this neighborhood for more than five years now and soooooo wanted to love this place but dam, this was a disappointment. \\n\\nThere is a bunch that is nice about this place, the ramen is solid, the decor is cool, but it really comes down to price. A bowl of ramen at Chuko, paying a Bushwick lease, is $16 + tip. *This just doesn't seem right* and doesn't compare to the food options in the area. (a large pizza at Archies is $14)\\n\\nI can only imagine the pressure a restaurant is to have fine ingredients but that price is the difference between me visiting this place once a week and visiting once every few months. \\n\\nA $10 - $12 ramen option would change everything about this place. I hope they can adapt to this neighborhood, right now it doesn't seem that way, and i frequently walk by this place and notice how few customers are in here. The price of ramen has actually increased since it opened.\", u'Love this place honestly the best ramen I have ever had. Very modern looking too. Pork bone is highly recommended.', u\"Definitely my favorite ramen in Brooklyn/NYC. Being Japanese, I tend to shy away from ramen spots that aren't totally 100% authentic but Chuko REALLY grew on me. The menu is a lot more fun and interesting than your typical ramen spot, offering veggie broth options as well as a Kimchi broth. For every ramen you have a choice of broth and protein, which gives you the option to try out different combos until you find your perfect sweet spot. My go-to order would be the Veggie Miso broth, spicy ground pork, soft-boiled egg, and of course...the garlic chili oil! Be sure to order this EXACT combo and you will not be disappointed. Highly recommend Chuko if you need your ramen fix!\", u\"The veggie miso was delicious!! When I became pescatarian I was bummed that I couldn't eat a lot of ramen broths anymore. But the ramen here really hit the spot, also it comes with an egg (essential). And finally the service was really friendly and quick.\", u'Great salt level and flavors in my soy ramen. Also the pork was so thick and spot on.  Was super happy with this despite getting my head around the strange concept of 20 buck ramen, but in nyc that seems the norm for legit elevated stuff.  Delicious and well done!', u\"Brussels we're out of this world! So good we got them twice! Usually when I get ramen I finish eating once the noodles are gone but the broth at the place was so good I finished the whole thing. Anyway... good please for sure going again!\"], u'194.Colonie': [u\"Cute little place. Went here for bunch on a Saturday with my friend. Got there at 1 and didn't have to wait. Waitress was very friendly, kept refilling our water and didn't care that we talked for another half hour after she gave us the bill. Didn't feel rushed.\\n\\nFood and drinks are expensive (normal for the area though) and high quality. We both had the Turkish eggs and they were great. Unique combination of spices and the yogurt and bread that went with it cooled the spicyness. Really good dish. Had a mimosa also, tasted mostly like orange juice but it was definitely freshly squeezed. \\n\\nI recommend for brunch to catch up with a friend! I want to go back and try dinner.\", u\"Had the best time here on Friday night. Went for my best friend's birthday and was treated like royalty. Started with some great oysters for a buck each at the bar, and some well mixed martinis. We had a reservation for 8 for 6:15 pm, but never felt rushed to get to our table. Also had the nitro iced coffee, which was possibly the best iced coffee we had ever had. \\n\\nAnyways, we got to the table and surprised my friend with a happy birthday message on the menu. (The manager had been so helpful in making this happen!) The servers were on point and the food was incredible. The steak frites was perfectly cooked and the pasta with blue crab was heavenly. \\n\\nMy friend had the best time and I'm so thankful!\", u\"Located in downtown Brooklyn, Colonie straddles an area that is in the midst of hyper gentrification while pockets are still very  much where they have been economically for decades.  Nestled in an old building, Colonie has a very unassuming storefront which leads into a gorgeous space full of wood and brick decor that feels almost like a hug as you walk in.\\n\\nColonie has a relatively large amount of space for a Brooklyn eatery, and they try to maximize that space as much as they can.  In the front are seats by the windows.  A small bar is near the host station (which becomes necessary during busy hours) and towards the back is the main seating area.  To one side is the open kitchen where lucky diners can eat and watch the chefs create the wonderful dishes served by the restaurant.  Nearby are regular tables which can be put together for larger parties.\\n\\nI've gone to Colonie twice so far, and each time the service was spectacular and the food was great.  Both times I had the Leek & Chevre Scramble which is a wonderfully fluffy egg scramble that practically melts in your mouth.  Less successful are their biscuits, which I think are meant to be rustic but have less taste and are more solid than I care for.  I have had the sausage side too and that is absolutely delicious.\\n\\nIf you are going to come here for brunch, I highly recommend getting there as early as you can.  The first time I went there was a huge crowd waiting, so you have been warned.  Plan properly, and you'll have a great time!\", u'Had such a wonderful experience! Front of house was such a pleasure. Sat at the chefs counter and could not say enough wonderful things about Ashley. She was extremely personable and absolutely made our night! The must orders : heirloom tomatoes, the fazalotti blue crab pasta and the sticky date -- WOW! Will definitely be back again for the staff, food and overall experience.', u\"Apparently there's limited brunch options in Brooklyn Heights, that's the only plausible explanation for such a mediocre restaurant being popular and having long waits over the weekend. We got the duck hash, shrimp grits, and buttermilk biscuits. Our waitress forgot about the biscuits, so we had to ask where it's at. Both main dishes were okay, nothing special, nothing amazing, shoutout to shrimps in shrimp and grits, with a strong ammonia aftertaste that indicates unfreshness. Biscuits were terrible, super dry and fell apart easily, accompanied with frozen butter that I absolutely hate to have at restaurant. What do you expect me to do with frozen butter, put it in microwave?! \\n\\nLuckily we came in around 11:30 and didn't have to wait.  By the time we left, the line was long and ppl were waiting outside on below 30 degree weather. Personally it's not worth the wait at all, and don't think I'd be back.\", u\"Came here for Sunday brunch after seeing really great reviews. The interior was really nicely done and the atmosphere was great. We were seated at the chefs counter, so it was totally entertaining to watch the cooks in action and all the great looking dishes coming out\\nI ordered the biscuit Benedict, my boyfriend ordered the scramble, and we shared the donuts.\\nThe ham on the Benedict was really chewy/fatty so wasn't loving, and thought the potatoes were bland. I tried the scramble, which was probably better than what I ordered.\\nThe donuts were a good brunch dessert so would recommend tacking those onto your order! Extra powdery with a tasty creme on the side\\nOverall I would rate the atmosphere a 4 and the food a 3\", u'Ate the most wonderful meal. Had the Lamb Belly with the delicious yogurt and mint sauce for starters. The lamb melted in my mouth. Then had the rigatoni pasta was favorable and a little spice to it. Finished off the meal thyme sugar coated donuts with lemon Meyer Chantilly  cream.', u\"Enjoyable time dining in this low-key but classy setting. \\n\\n-  Bay scallops: Amazing! 5 stars! The seared citrus and green chile coating is innovative and supremely flavorful.\\n-  Spring pickles: Bit too pungent for my taste. \\n-  Blistered duck egg (with arugula and lots of mushrooms): tasty and good vegetarian option; egg was good but not the best I've had).\\n-  Spaghetti in squid ink with rock shrimp: good amount of shrimp and very hearty; sauce certainly didn't lack for flavor, though may be too salty for some palates.\", u\"Stopped in for a fantastic late brunch. I had the duck hash, which despite having a slightly high ratio of potatoes to duck, was delicious due to the tangy sauce. I wish it came with more than one egg! My girlfriend had the leek and goat cheese scrambled eggs which were cooked perfectly and were the standout dish.\\n\\nThe nitro brewed and slightly carbonated cold brew was a fun change from drip coffee.\\n\\nOverall the prices are fair for the area, and the restaurant has a great space with a charming green wall. The only thing to watch out for is that the open kitchen concept means the back part of the restaurant gets a bit hot.\\n\\nI'd put it in the upper tier or brunch places I've been to in New York\", u\"Colonie is my go to brunch place. I have probably been here at least a dozen times and it never ceases to amaze. \\n\\nI will be singing their praises for a few minutes, so let me get the minor negative out of the way: they get busy! Which means you may wait if you go with a party larger than 2. With that out of the way, let me tell you want I love: mainly the style and ambiance. The kitchen is 100% exposed with a bar wrapping around it that you can sit at and eat while you watch the chefs at work. If they aren't overloaded, they will even chat with you. They were nice enough to answer questions about what they were making and their technique (in case, you know, you decide to cook at home instead of going out all the time, like me...). The wait staff is friendly and extremely attentive. It seems like everyone who works at Colonie is dedicated to an excellent experience for all their guests, and they never fail to delight.\\n\\nOk, the food. Its great! Not sure how else to say it, I gave this review 5 stars, didn't I? I've had the Leek & Chevre Scramble, BIscuit Benedict, Shrimp and Grits, and Burger. All were amazing, always cooked well and from watching the chefs, seemingly at ease. I feel like there isn't much on this menu that isn't good. One thing I will add, my favorite cocktail here is the Empire State Sour, which is no longer on the menu, but can be asked for. I feel guilty when I ask for a drink off the menu, but the bartenders here are awesome and always accommodate. If the Colonie team is reading this, please put it back on the menu and alleviate my guilt!\\n\\nMy recommendation: go, Go, GO! Stop reading and go. You will not be disappointed!\", u\"Colonie was a great spot for brunch in Brooklyn Heights. I visited last weekend and enjoyed my experience.\\n\\nMy table started with the monkey bread drenched in toffee sauce and topped with pecans. We split amongst 3 and seemed to be the perfect size.\\n\\nFor my main I tried the biscuit benedict. Since the biscuits were homemade they were extremely fresh and then topped with smoked ham, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. It came with a side of potatoes on the side. Plus, if you want a side of bacon or sausage you can add that for just $3.\\n\\nI was happy that my friend had come to Colonie before and new how to play the brunch game. They open at 11am and don't take reservations for brunch. They have plenty of bar seating, but if you want to guarantee a table I would show up between 11 and 11:15.\", u\"My sister and I ended up here on a whim before we went grocery shopping at Trader Joe's, and I'm so glad we did! The food was amazing and service was great, we sat at the Chef's counter and were not turned off at all watching the team prepare our meal!  \\n\\nThe pancakes were crunchy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. They had the perfect touch of sweetness without being too much! The duck hash had hugeeee pieces of duck so you definitely know you're getting your money's worth. The fresh greens added a nice change to the already innovative dish. The eggs were light and fluffy, so I'm sure their egg scramble on the menu is amazing too! The biscuits were dense but not in a bad way and with nice crispy edges. The preserves were a little sweet for my taste, but still tasty! \\n\\nI definitely recommend and would come here again!\", u'This place is so amazing ... quality of ingredients and the taste of the food. I will definitely come back. Most people seem to order the Benedict and Duck Hash. The Biscuit Benedict was a hit on my list. The grass fed burger was super tasty too. I would give this spot above 5 stars if possible. Awesome !', u\"You must try the duck hash, it is AMAZING. The photos don't do it justice. My friends had the leak and ch\\xe8vre scramble and the trout, both were great too. But that duck hash!! Incredible. \\n\\nIf you're coming from Manhattan like we were, definitely hang around after brunch, this area of Brooklyn is lovely!\", u'I had a good meal here. I had the Duck hash, this was the only thing I eat whenever I go to this place. The portion was huge and the eggs  were perfectly cooked. Reasonable prices for very good food. The servers were in a hurry and trying to rush me out.', u\"Brunch in Brooklyn! As a west coast boy, wandering around Brooklyn looking for good eats is an affair of the heart. I settled on Colonie in Brooklyn Heights after an unnecessarily exhaustive search through reviews and online map locations close-ish to my hotel. (admit you do all this too.)\\n\\nIt's a crowded spot with lots of good Brooklyn energy and I was lucky enough to get a table towards the back of the restaurant. I started with the French Press Coffee (it was my special day after all...). It was great...as strong as I wanted it to be, perhaps a tad acidic for my taste.\\n\\nI had a Kale and Gruyere scramble with jack cheese. They declined my request to make it with egg whites or any egg substitute...so if you are looking for eggs and always get that option, this isn't the place for you. (I'm accustomed to paying a surcharge for egg whites, but definitely not accustomed to places refusing to make your egg dish with egg whites. Whites...that comes with every egg...it's not like they were out of them...so disappointing not to have this healthy option.)  I got it anyway...it as very runny which is not how I like my eggs...salted too much, and the cheese it was cooked with had very little noticeable presence in the dish.\\n\\nI ordered a biscuit on the side. If a brunch place has a biscuit, being the biscuit fanatic, it's a mandatory order for me. I've had biscuits, literally all over the world...this was the first time I couldn't actually finish a biscuit. It was very heavy and tasted a bit like I was eating oil. When biscuits fail me, I begin to weep.\\n\\nColonie turns into a wine bar and they had an impressive looking cocktail menu. Had it not been first thing in the morning I would have loved to try the Watermelon Chili Margarita. (And back here in Los Angeles I'm salivating about the idea of this cocktail.)\\n\\nKudos for changing the menu up with the seasons. As of this writing, the scramble has changed on their menu. I'd give the place another shot for the evening menu and cocktails, but not offering egg whites or other healthy egg substitute as an option, plus the biscuit fail is a deal breaker for me in terms of lunch.\\n\\nP.S. They also had free copies of the New York Times which they offered to bring to the table. That's cool.\", u\"Look no further than Colonie for your next (small group) brunch in Brooklyn. I don't even know how to begin describing the biscuits. SO GOOD, even in all caps, doesn't do these beauties justice. The Biscuit Benedict, therefore, is out of this world. We sat at the chef's counter and watched the magic take place, and were not at all deterred by the ingredients or cooking methods - which is saying something for a southern-comfort style breakfast. The Duck Hash was incredible, and we had the fluffy cast-iron baked pancakes to share as an appetizer. \\n\\nDrinks are delicious, too. Try the cucumber refresher martini and the blood orange margarita. You will thank me (and Colonie)!\", u\"If you find yourself in this part of town, you must swing by Colonie for brunch. Scratch that - no better reason to venture to the Brooklyn Heights area. \\n\\nPhenomenal meal with my favorite type of seating - chef's table overlooking the kitchen. The shrimps and grits were TOP (I don't think I've ever had them with mushrooms!) and the dessert doughnuts can't be skipped. They serve my favorite brunch cocktail as well: a Mezcal coffee mix. Sounds bad, tastes great.\", u'Great place for a date night or a dinner with friends. We went with another couple and shared a bunch of different dishes which was great because we could take advantage of the great menu.\\n\\nFood Highlights: Sea Bass Crudo, Toasts (ricotta and sardine), Lamb Belly, Heirloom Tomato Salad, and Spicy Squid Ink Spaghetti. Would reorder all of those items in a heartbeat!\\n\\nAmbiance: Perfection. Great lighting, open kitchen, buzzing scene but not too loud or crowded.\\n\\nHighly recommend and will 100% revisit.', u'My visit here didn\\'t start off well-- we waited for about 30 minutes, even though we had a reservation.  Finally, the hostess said our \"table\" was ready, and ushered us to the bar stools by the kitchen, whic were clearly not our table, as they had been empty the whole time.  (Plus, just after that, a table opened and she offered us a seat there.)\\n\\nIn spite of the rough start, I really enjoyed this place.  The seats by the kitchen were pretty cool.  Nice to see the meals being prepared.  I was surprised by how simple the set up seemed to be.  \\n\\nI enjoyed my wine and the meal.  We had brussels sprouts and burrata as appetizers.  The brussels sprouts were more of a salad.  Not what I was expecting.  Decent, but probably wouldn\\'t order again.  The burrata was great.  \\n\\nFor dinner, we had bavette (yum) and burger (pretty good).  Even though we were stuffed, we had the donuts for dessert.  Is there anything better than a fresh donut?'], u'196.The Castello Plan': [u\"Read about Monday's unlimited mussels night and couldn't believe the deal at a mere $10 per person, so had to come check it out with the boyfriend. The waitress was very friendly and informed us of the deal immediately. We also got happy hour drinks (choice of martini or manhattan) since it was after 10pm. Double deal! \\n\\nMussels: Came in big buckets with a yummy salsa verde, relatively small size but can't complain since it's unlimited. Waitress was very quick to ask us if we wanted more, and each batch came out in no time. My boyfriend claims he ate over 100 of these that night.\\n\\nPlum & arugula salad: Fresh and light while the sharp cheese cut through the other flavors nicely. A good size to share as a starter or side amongst two people.\", u\"Sat here at the bar with my friends and boyf last weekend...ahhhh this place holds a special place in my heart now.\\n\\nFirst I have to say that our service was outstanding. I'm not sure if he was making AND serving our drinks because I was wrapped up in conversation and it was a busy night here with a lot of people behind the bar, but the guy that delivered our drinks was super attentive and informative. Asking us what we liked about the flavors, all smiles, super personable. He seemed to really care about us and our experience. \\n\\nThe vibe was bustling but homey, rustic and welcoming, as are a lot of places I'm discovering in this neighborhood, which I love! \\n\\nThe burger was one of the best I've had in all of NYC. \\n\\nThanks Costello Plan. I'll surely be back.\", u\"Wow. Just wow.\\n\\nIf you've been reading my reviews of the cool brunch spots in my neighborhood and my wife and I going to them and eating, you would probably know that she is the master of choosing a much better dish than me. That doesn't mean that my dish sucks, but hers is always better than mine. Well when we came here for brunch not too long ago, my losing streak ended, and I finally chose something that was better than her food! I've never been so proud of myself!\\n\\nWell maybe that last sentence isn't true, but this next one is: this was the best breakfast hash I've ever had. Oh my LAND that was good. the pulled pork hash at this place is worth 4.5 stars at least. Honestly my rating here (which is 4.5 stars) is based solely on that. It is a magical amalgamation of flavors, if you could excuse my excitement! My wife got the Brooklyn logger, which is like a full on breakfast party complete with fresh squeezed orange juice and you can even add a beer of you want. It sounded great actually, but I picked the hash instead because, well I'm a sucker for hash. And boy am I glad I did!\\n\\nWith so many delicious (and cool) brunch spots in our area, this was the only place we've been to that I wanted to return to just to have the same thing I ordered last time. Oh boy is it good. It was so good in fact, that after i destroyed it was when I realized that I didn't even touch my spicy aioli that it comes with, as a dipping sauce. So now I have to go back, because maybe it tastes even better with the sauce! All hail the pulled pork hash!\\n\\nPS: the day we went they were strangely playing a bunch of justin beiber songs in a row. We were sitting outside because it was a nice day, but we could still kind of hear it. that was weird.\", u\"Quant spot for some good brunch! I like that you can either sit inside or outside and they have a limited menu. I ordered the Cobb salad which was delicious. It comes with blue cheese dressing already on it so make sure you know that. Hubbs ordered the pulled pork skillet which was really good too. Next time I may order that since that came with two eggs and bread. It's very small but cute. It's amazing how much this area has changed and only for the better!!!\", u\"Great little restaurant bar, surprisingly crowded late on a Saturday night (or I guess I shouldn't be surprised, it's Brooklyn, right? Excuse this Dallas girl...) I really loved my cocktail, the Hera's Garden. It was so unique, with fresh apple cider, jalape\\xf1o, mint, lime and apple cinnamon bitters. Really have never had anything like it, and the waiter confirmed that it's one of their most popular concoctions. My sister had the Bee's Knees, a classic cocktail that they do well.\\n\\nWe also split the Brownie Sundae, and subbed the spicy chocolate ice cream for the vanilla (I recommend that choice). Really delicious. Excellent experience overall, would 100% go back.\", u'Really like this cozy little bar/restaurant.  Have been twice so far, they have a great cocktail menu and delicious wine.  This time I had the white bean soup to start, catfish tacos, pasta and bread pudding for dessert with basil ice cream.  The fresh basil ice cream was the highlight along with a tawny port.', u\"Unlimited mussels on Monday nights? Don't mind if I do!\\n\\nIt's a pretty no-frills mussels night. You don't get a choice of broth. You just get a gigantic bowl of mussels and a side of deliciously fresh sourdough bread. So I'm definitely not complaining.\\n\\nWe destroyed about 4 rounds of mussels (pretty sure the waitress was trying to steer us away from ordering another... understandably).\\n\\nThey also had happy hour specials when we sat down, so I had a pretty good gimlet.\\n\\nI'd like to say that I'll come back when it's not bottomless mussels... but I'm not a liar\", u\"Very sexy cool spot with great drinks and delicious tapas. If you are looking to be a place with a cool vibe then don't hesitate to come check this place out.\", u'I love this place. I was there twice, one week after the other, and each experience was great. When we walked in with a party of 4, the place looked full. There is one larger table in the corner that had a \"reserved\" sign. HUGE TIP: ask them if you can sit there. If you\\'re a large group, they will probably let you. It is sometimes not actually reserved. I don\\'t think they\\'ll seat a couple there, but its great for a group of 5-7 people. The cheese plate is great, but I mean, its cheese. I know what taste to expect. I loved the gnocchi and had it both times i was there. My friend did not like the soup, but it was exchanged and we were happy about that. They had a scallop special which was very good. It is not cheap though, but no regrets.', u\"Went here last night for dinner with my fianc\\xe9. Its a beautiful spot with a charming interior and subtle exterior, but everything else was lacking. My fianc\\xe9 got the burger which was decent, but he complained of na off aftertaste. I got the tacos which barely had any catfish and was mostly radish and cabbage. There wasn't much flavor.  We got the brownie sundae for desert. The brownies were rock hard! We could barely break them with our spoons! My jaw was sore from chewing. The staff is really sweet, but the service was really slow. When we got there we had to wait 15min just to place and order, but there was really just one girl dealing with everyone. One guy occasionally helped her but she was on her own mostly. When we were paying she even acknowledged the long wait times and said I'll wait for you, so you don't have to wait long again. There are a lot of awesome reviews for brunch so maybe that's a better meal to have here, but dinner def wasn't.\", u\"I generally like this place. The interior design is very pleasing, and the food is good. The music is good but too loud.  I had their Tempra\\xf1illo, cauliflower soup, pumpkin gnocchi and homemade ice cream. Everything was delicious and the service is top notch! I'm in love and will become a regular here. Great local restaurant. Try mushroom crostini, mussels, gazpacho, fish tacos, signature cocktails.\", u\"I didn't find the artisanal allure here that I expect from American (new) and tapas restaurants. \\n\\nWe started with a charcuterie board. The meats were unimpressive. The salmon and caraway seed crostini had a sardine scent to it. I liked the idiazabal and Camembert cheeses. The idiazabal had a texture comparable to manchego and a very slight smokiness. The Camembert was creamy and similar to a Brie, yet it had a very mild flavor to it. The Camembert paired well with the cherry jam. I would recommend both of the cheeses.\\n\\nFor our main course, we split the green pappardelle. The pasta was fettuccini not pappardelle. It came in a creamy sauce and was plated with a few interesting ingredients like olives, cherry tomatoes, and ricotta.\\n\\nThe service was friendly and attentive. It seemed like our waiter was in training so he was reliant on the other staff members to answer our questions.\", u'Went here for brunch on a Sunday. We reserved a table for 6. \\n\\nI had two cocktails that tasted good. One was the rye toast and the cocktail with mezcal. Mezcal is a Mexican alcohol made out of agave. I had it the first time and I think the cocktail complimented the alcohol well.\\n\\nI had the burger and the mushroom crepe. I looove savory crepes so I recommend that. Burger was excellent too.\\n\\nI would recommend this place for brunch.', u\"1. One of the best restaurants in Brooklyn. Such a hidden gem. Always great for an unbelievable brunch or phenomenal dinner.\\n\\n2. Super accommodating, incredible staff that makes great drinks, picks great music, and seems to genuinely enjoy working there. \\n\\n3. They bent over backwards to help make an unforgettable moment with a surprise proposal... they could not have been more helpful, invested, and just generally wonderful. There's a reason we did it at Castello Plan - it's just the best.\", u\"I came here for drinks on Saturday night after dinner at The Farm on Adderley. We had passed by around 6 looking for a dinner spot and it was super crowded. We came back around 8 and there were only like two or three tables taken. They have 3 tall, long tables that fit 4-6 people (depending on stools available), a small bar with a few seats, and the rest are small, round 2-3 person tables. They also have some seating in the patio outside. The bar is dark, intimate, and romantic, with bare bulbs on the walls and candles on the tables. I loved the wood walls on one side and the brick wall on the other. The windows were large and bar area was pretty. They had shelving covering the entire back wall, with bottles filling up each shelf. Glasses were hanging from the bar in front of that. It's rustic and modern. \\n\\nThe tall tables are on one side and the small tables are lower and on the right side of the bar. I liked this because it separated the group vibe from the date vibe. We only got drinks, so I don't know anything about the food here. I've seen great reviews though! 4 of us had beer and wine and 1 person got a martini. She only drank a bit of it because it was really salty. \\n\\nThe music was pretty poppy, with Taylor Swift and Adele being two memorable ones that came on. I think the atmosphere would have been near perfect if they had had better music, but it wasn't loud enough to be distracting. The bathroom was cute, clean, and spacious. On my way there I also saw that there was a larger circular table near it. This would be good for groups that want to sit at a normal table, but the downside is that it's next to the bathroom and the bar. The rest of the seats are nice because we had a nice view of Cortelyou Road. \\n\\nWe arrived a bit too late for the wine/cocktail happy hour, but it looks like a good deal! $6 for house wines and $7 for the bartender's choice cocktail. There is also a 10 pm-midnight deal, which is $7 for a manhattan or martini.\", u\"Nice place for a cozy date in a middle of a week. Choose a bottle of wine and a cheese plate, don't order mussels, they are to small and will not satisfy you\", u\"Been here quite a few times.. Seems like the last 3 visits though, the service has changed along with the staff.. We decided to give them another shot, and seems some changes have been made for the better. The service and food were on point this time.. Nothing forgotten, missing, prompt drink and 'mussels' refills.. The staff was very friendly and seemed to enjoy attending to customers needs, a welcome change over the last few visits.. The mussels were delicious. A bit larger than I normally like, but these were tender and meaty for their size. Not salty at all.. Looking forward to going back again.,\", u\"Came here on a slow Friday evening with the misses. We weren't really that hungry so the small plates, cheese and wine were right up our alley that night. The waitress did a great job of going over all the different types of cheese since we're no connoisseurs lol. The food was delicious and they even have a manhattan on the happy hour which runs in two sections. One in early evening and the other late at night starting at 10. We will definitely return.\", u\"Came here for brunch w/friends on their recommendation.  They have lunch here on a weekly basis, THAT'S how good this place is!  Super cute, small space, Brooklyn decor.\\n\\nWe got a nice cozy round table towards the back that comfortably sat all 6 of us.  Menu prices are awesome!  I had their burger which was a perfect size.  Not too big, not too small to be a slider, cooked just how I liked.  Had a nice mixed greens instead of a huge slice of Romaine, with small, baked, fingerling potatoes that were delicccccc!!!\\n\\nFriends got the Breakfast Plan that was served in multiple, really cute side dishes.  We also got a plate of the Challah French Toast that was perfect to share.  The Brooklyn Logger comes with a slice of grapefruit and freshly squeezed oj (COME ON!) that came before the meal, so that was a nice little app.\\n\\nGood coffee, good tea.  I had their Cada Semana cocktail which, helloooooo, mezcal for brunch?  Yes please!  The drink has mezcal, cocchi americano, and grapefruit.  A perfect, refreshing brunch cocktail.\\n\\nWill def come back here on Monday night for their unlimited mussels.  Yes, yes, yes please.\\n\\nOh, and another definite plus?  Their waitstaff were awesome.  So nice, came at a timely manner, etc.  Service was great.\", u\"Fresh, good quality food. I've come back again and again for brunch, and they are consistently delicious with all of their dishes. Will come back to try dinner one day.\"], u'175.El Castillo De Jagua': [u\"An ideal diner for a breakfast stop, wonderful atmosphere, grub & staff ensure I'll return to investigate lunch & dinner. \\n\\nAffordable, delicious, endearingly friendly & sincere staff: if dissatisfied, have a honest chat with Jose, the owner & he'll be sure to improve your experience. \\n\\nDon't frequently review businesses: this honest review is for a family business well worth supporting!\", u'You can fins me here 2-3 times a week. A working man can come here and get the food they need to power through the rest of the day at a GREAT VALUE. This is comfort food for the neighborhood.', u'Great place for breakfasts, lunch & dinner.  Accommodate all my off menus request. Reasonable $$, Healthy varieties grill or steam, nice avocados, very clean. Love the medieval times dininroom. Great to chill with a beer or wine during happy hrs. Staff very humble and friendly.', u'This place is ok.  Food was decent but nothing too spectacular.  I came for mangu with cheese and eggs but they had run out, which hopefully is a good indicator that their mangu might be the thing to eat here.  I had tostones with eggs and cheese, the portion size for the tostones was very generous but the eggs and the cheese were not as plentiful.  I had a batida de mamey which was very delicious and tres leches which was also just ok.  While the waitstaff was very friendly the meal time was prolonged by the amount of time we waited between courses for our waitress to check in with us and the wait for the check was also quite lengthy.  With so many competitors in the area I am unlikely to return.', u\"Discovered this place while walking in the neighborhood searching for lunch. This place totally fit the bill. Did not realize how spacious it was inside. They really stuck to that castle team decoration even down to the bathroom. Our waitress was nice and attentive. I ordered stewed goat while the hubby got chicken along with plantains and rice and beans. Dishes were both satisfying. Lunch came in large portions so much so that we packed it and ate the next day. Their drinks are not bad either. \\n\\nThe best part was that our lunch was under $10. Can't beat in our neighborhood.\", u\"We were in a rush to get a quick takout lunch for the airport, which left us with only being able to order from the food that was already made. We decided on the roasted pork, which they put over mashed plantains. I really wanted mofongo but unfortunately didn't have the time to wait. The service was very friendly and patient; before dishing up the pork, they even asked what cut we wanted (lean or fatty/skin). The pork was flavorful and moist, and the onions they served the pork over really made the dish. They almost had a pickled taste, but added a ton of flavor. Plantains were just okay- not much flavor and the ratio of plantains to pork was about 4:1 (could have used more meat). Overall, the food was pretty good, but I would give this place another chance because I can see the potential with other dishes that take more time to cook.\", u'After having a couple great meals here, we had Castillo cater for our wedding and the food was sooooooo good.  So many of the guests commented that the choice of food was spot-on.  The favorite was definitely the beef stew!  Giovanni (the owner) was super nice as well.  Other than convincing us to order a little more food than we needed & bringing boiled instead of fried yuca, we were very happy with the service.  We will definitely be coming back for more.', u\"Absolutely PHENOMENAL. Home cooked, nothing else quite like it in the neighborhood. Always consistent\\n\\n\\n04.01.2017\\nBACK AGAIN!!!!!!!!! I just want to sit here and eat all damn day that's how good this home cooked food is. Home fries are perfect, bacon done right and the sweetest employees in the neighborhood.\", u'Amazing food! Great service! Seats available to sit down and grab a drink. I had food catered for a party and I ordered it last minute, the day before and they were able to cook everything and have it ready on time.', u\"This is my family's favor restaurant , its great environment, awesome people, overall the owner it's a wonderful. My daughter loves the steak in here.\", u\"I've been here several times and its a great place. As a Dominican who grew up eating the real deal everyday, this place is as good as it gets. It will definitely remind you of mom's cooking. Their totones are amazing and even though i don't eat meat anymore, their pernil is legit! Will continue to order from here.\", u\"They were really pleasant answering the phone. Seemed like he heard and listened carefully. Phone manners were good. Soon as I receive my order, i got two yolks w/ home fries and crispy bacon ... yuck ( who eats just yolk) I wanted to throw up. My daughter ordered mangu the mangu is extremely dry. Eggs weren't good either. A quarter of my coffee spilled in the bag . The delivery guy cam on a bike maybe that's the reason.  The breads were extremely hard. I would never recommend this restaurant to Anyone! Not good.\", u'Hanging out with my friends at this amazing restaurant.  Great ambiance, good music, oh and very clean bathrooms! \\n\\nGreat tasting food, desserts and beverages!', u'Had a hard time deciding what to get because everything looked good. I ended up getting the baked chicken, arroz con ganules (rice and peas) and platano maduros  (soft, sweet, fried plantains). My sister ordered the pernil & arroz con gandules. The food was well seasoned and not dry. We both enjoyed our food and were looking at the menu to see what we would get on our next visit. There is Spanish music playing just loud enough to hear. You can have a conversation without having to talk loudly in here. Will be back here soon.', u'Finally an authentic latin food restaurant n my neighborhood that has the A-Ok by me. Glad they are in the neighborhood', u'Eat here all the time. Food is amazing, fresh and filling portions all with the price being right!!!', u'Bomb chicken, very good pricing, helpful and friendly staff', u\"Based on outside appearance this place could be confused for White Castle...but lo and behold once you step in, this place is legit a plethora of deliciousness! And super budget friendly. A friend introduced me to this place being new to the neighborhood. You can def feed 2 to 3 ppl under $20 and still have leftovers. That is if you don't devour everything! So I don't know the of names of each dish, but I'm describing as they look.\\nThey have braised chicken stew, braised pork stew, oxtail and stewed beef, roast chicken, plantains, rice n beans and more.\\nIf you choose to sit down, plenty of tables in back of restaurant. Staff is super friendly too.\", u\"First and foremost the atmosphere in this restaurant is very relaxing. The waitress and owner will come around just to check to make sure you're having a wonderful experience. The food is good and very reasonably priced. A pleasant place to come with family. The decor is unique and matches a medieval feel with antique knights and shields around the restaurant. Been waiting for a spanish restaurant that cooks good food to come to the neighborhood and I'm very happy to have find one. Definitely coming back.\", u'I wanted to try something different. I was craving for Spanish food so I came on here in search for a good spot. I am so glad we went there. The food was plenty and it tasted GOOOOD. Customer service was also wonderful. I am very picky when it comes to my food so the server was nice enough to let me sample two choices. I ended up getting both because they were both so good. I highly recommend this place! We are actually heading over there now for some lunch. :)'], u'15.Peaches HotHouse': [u\"Everything was good.  I've never been to Nashville, unfortunately, so I don't know how this compares to Prince's.  But hot or not, this is good fried chicken.  The meat is well seasoned, the skin nice and crisp.  Hot was pretty hot, but I think the extra hot version would be fine too. \\n\\nAll the sides were great - the greens were actually salted and seasoned well, an unfortunate rarity.  The mac and cheese was great - splurge and get it.  Corn bread too, it was of the sweet variety.  \\n\\nFun place too, intimate seating and a friendly staff.\", u\"My first visit was Saturday. it was quite breezy while I waited outside for my name to be called. my friend date lives around the corner so she showed up and we went in. one has to put their name on a dry erase board . i heard that there is a wait almost daily. i guess if one arrives upon opening their may not be. anyway it is not a large restaurant. i would say it could fit 40 people at most. the menu is small and i appreciate that there is a full bar as well as their own specialty drinks. we sat in a corner window seat that was surprisingly not too tight.\\ni had the hot house shrimp with mac and cheese and an additional side; sauteed kale. the kale could have been chopped smaller but it was delicious. \\nthe service was average but i am not the type of person to be super needy. basically i order eat and leave. this place is also not made for lingering . that is cool. after a while you may feel claustrophobic. \\ni don't remember if they offer dessert. I would like to go back to try the fried chicken. peaches is alright in my book\", u\"Great products, great service (shout-out to Bert and Clarence) and the food comes out timely, but the person who manages (whoever this may be) putting waiting customers in the open seats in a hurried fashion should be fired! I've seen people walk away frustrated! \\n\\nThese days, with respect to Peaches, I prefer to just do take-out and not dine in. This keeps my blood pressure stable. \\n\\nIt's a shame because others with the same notion, will cause the beverage side of their business to be affected. God knows that I'd like to see Karli and Chiron win at the bar with the extra stream from the higher tipping. They are both, excellent!\", u\"I have to give this place 5 stars because I'm not a huge fried chicken fan and this place had the best fried chicken I have ever tasted. I like spicy and it was HOT, but still had flavor. I order the Mac and cheese as a side (that could use a little work).\\n\\nWhat impressed me were the happy hour specials! There happy hour started at noon with $6 cocktail specials. I got the sweet tea bourbon cocktails and it was sweet and strong! \\n\\nPrices here are reasonable and food is really good!\", u\"Where has this resturant been my whole life?!?!? I was seriously blown away by how DELICIOUS everything was. \\nThis location was small.. the wait was kind of long but it was worth it.. there was 6 of us and we squeezed into a corner table. \\n\\nMost of us at the table had the chicken with mac and cheese. \\n\\nThe mac and cheese was so good it would make you wanna slap your face with it. I was very impressed. \\n\\nThe chicken... oh man, it was so juicy and cooked well. The skin was crispy but not greasy. The corn bread was slightly sweet and 100% on point. \\n\\nMy friends said the hot sauce on the table is a must(I personally don't like spicy so I didn't try)\\n\\n\\nThe sweet tea is real southern style sweet tea, you'll love it!!\\n\\n\\nI will be back... You need to try it.\\n\\nYou get 3 breasts on white toast with a side and corn bread for $15.\", u'Wow this fried chicken is no joke! I came here on Sunday for Brunch at around 2PM. I waited about 20 minutes? You write your name on a board inside. \\n\\nThe chicken was super juicy and flavorful. But CAUTION the extra spicy is NO JOKE. Its ghost pepper based. Even the hot was pretty spicy after a while. I would caution everyone who likes spicy foods to get hot and just pour in some hot sauce if you want more. \\n\\nI got the chicken and french toast and it was so good! The piece of chicken was a little small but the french toast was different and delicious. It also came with eggs as well as grits. I really enjoyed the grits here. It was very creamy.', u\"The food here is pretty tasty. Ambiance is unpretentious, simple and casual. Slightly tight seating. I came for an impromptu brunch with a friend and was impressed. Ive never had eggs so delicious in my life. They were scrambled to perfection--buttery and creamy and cheesy only there was no cheese. How did they do it? \\nMy meal also included the famous fried chicken, granola crusted French toast, and grits. The chicken was tasty, well seasoned, crispy yet juicy. The granola French toast was also good as well as the grits. Being that it was my first time, and the placed Is called peaches I wanted to try some peaches with my food. The server was nice enough to bring me some peaches since it wasn't included with my order. Sadly they had an off taste like they were going bad and I couldn't eat them.\\n\\nService was pretty good and I would return. Because of the tight seating it's not somewhere I would recommend for new company but if you want a chill vibe and good food it's a great neighborhood spot.\", u\"I am floored. DAMNNNNN\\n\\nI've been living in the area for a bit and kept hearing about peaches so I knew I had to check it out. Also the idea of hot wings that are not drenched in sauce was LIT. \\n\\nMy friend and I ordered hot thighs, Mac n cheese, crispy shrimp sandwich, and collard greens. With that, we also got the black velvet cocktail.\\n\\nI really don't know how this review will get written because I am speechless. Everything was on point. The chicken is ACTUALLY SPICY. Thank the lord. I looked back on all the times I have been duped in NYC...getting warned about spice levels only to not feel a thing!!!! But this is good stuff. I cannot wait to try the actual extra hot ones. The crispy shrimp was also very nice. It's a sandwich with some of their slaw on it, which is so good. The collard greens were great.\\n\\nThe cocktail was tequila, iced coffee, baileys, and kahlua.....I got turnt during this lunch. The drink is creamy and delicious. \\n\\nI am literally about to go back right now.\", u\"Comfort food, spicy chicken, and great service all in one spot!\\nThey have an amazing happy hour from noon to 6, and actually offer you a choice of their 3 most popular cocktails! \\nFood can sometimes take a while, but the wait is worth it! Their mac n cheese is the best I've had so far in the city.\", u'Go on a weekend and you will sit. You will sit while you wait. You might be tempted to leave after 20 minutes. Don\\'t.\\n\\nGet the hot chicken and ask for more spice. They will give it to you. You will put it on the already hot chicken. Then you\\'ll say, \"My mouth feels like it\\'s on a cell extraction upstate.\"\\n\\nThe hot chicken is hot. You don\\'t need the extra spice. Pay no mind to the heinously long wait. \\n\\nThe chicken here is incredibly good.', u\"We went for a late dinner and on the waiting list. The host was very gracius in keeping us posted with the status Of the wait and All. \\nWe didn't wait Long.\\nThe location is really simple, small restaurant.\\nWe had fried shrimps, I had collard greens and all is served with a slice of bread, pickles and corn bread.\\nNice portions, decent prices. I am not a southern food expert, but I can recognize good food: The shrimps were great, super crispy, crunchy and delicious.\\nWe'll be back to try more items, like shrimps and grits, Mac n cheese, etc!\", u\"Tiny restaurant boasting the best fried chicken around.  The place seats around 35 people and is well decorated. \\nThe servers are friendly and on the ball, always there when you need them without being intrusive. \\nWe tried the loaded grits which were delicious. \\nThe hot fried chicken sandwiches were some of the best fried chicken I've ever had, and came with a delicious aioli. Both the fries and sweet potato fries were on point. \\nThey have a reasonable large selection of fun cocktails. The bourbon lemonade was delicious. \\nBest of all, the pricing compared to the slew of southern chicken joints in Williamsburg is great. \\nHighly recommend checking out this place.\", u'They have made the most of this quaint and cozy corner space on Tompkins Avenue. This location seats about 30 people total and does an awesome job at keeping this spot feeling welcoming and comfortable. The portions are pretty hearty and food taste great. This is a cool place to briefly read a book at the bar or meet up when you have a small group, I would max it out at 3-4 for people. This is a no frills restaurant with good food and a relaxing vibe.', u\"UGHHHH I really wanted to love this place. I was obsessing over it for an entire week, scouring  and partially memorizing their menu cause I wanted to go so badly. I literally begged/ made my boyfriend drive me from manhattan and could not wait for the HOT CHICKEN! But alas, the chicken wasn't really that spicy. Maybe it's because I saw anthony bourdain's episode of nashville with the hot chicken 3 times in one day, but the chicken really wasn't that hot, which is so not cool! It's fine chicken, but not worth me day dreaming/ talking about it non stop for 3 days to the point where people asked me if I was okay in the head. Maybe it's my fault for hyping it up and wanting it too badly, but it really isn't like the hot chicken in nashville. \\n\\nWhat made it slightly worse is that they forgot I ordered hot chicken and gave me regular chicken and when I told them I ordered hot chicken, they just gave me the spice and asked me to sprinkle it over the chicken... I really dipped the chicken in the spice, like covering it, but again it wasn't that spicy. I was looking forward to ulcer producing spicy, but my mouth wasn't even tingling that much. Sure it was spicy, but not like HOT. I can't remember the other 4 dishes we ordered cause I'm still sad about the hot chicken. I'll edit the review to comment on the other food once I can get over the hot chicken not being hot. (probs won't happen)\", u\"Came here for a Sunday evening dinner. \\n- To avoid the 2.5-hour brunch wait we came around 5 pm and waited only 25 minutes for a table for 4\\n- I found the famous Fried Chicken to be A-OK, but not as amazing as I had expected from the incredibly rave reviews. There was nothing beyond the flavorful exterior. The white meat was so dry that it was inedible. I think Amy Ruth's Chicken and Waffles in Harlem still fares supreme in my book.\", u'My husband and I rolled up on Peaches Hothouse on July 4th, thoroughly convinced that we would like the food. The dining room was pretty packed as was the outside seating, and the bar was poppin\\' - all good signs. Alas...\\n\\n-1st star: The hostess was lovely,, but seated us at a tiny table between 2 other tiny tables where other couples were dining. We\\'re both fairly slim folks, but there was no elbow room whatsoever, and you could hear and observe EVERYTHING the other two couples were chatting about, drinking, and eating, mere inches away. An intimate ambience is cool, but having mad other people in your biz while trying to have a romantic dinner is not.\\n\\n-2nd star: We were quite hungry and eager to support our local community so we decided to order our food to go. When we arrived home, to my disappointment, they had forgotten to include the grilled broccoli that I had requested and paid for. I NEED veggies in my life at all times - so this oversight was a letdown.\\n\\n-3rd star: Then, after trying to console myself with my \"hot\" catfish, only to realize that it was not spicy in the least - no spicy seasoning with no hot or spicy sauce included, and that the fish was soggy with its underside breading sluffing off of it - I was just over it. \\n\\nIt ended up being an overrated, overpriced, less than mediocre meal. My husband got the shrimp sandwich and this was a bit better but overall having paid nearly $40 for some soggy catfish and a regular shrimp sandwich was not wassup. \\n\\nWe don\\'t stay too far from this spot, but it isn\\'t that close to us either. We won\\'t be back.', u\"I'm sad to say consistency is not always a thing.  I returned to Peaches HotHouse and had a less than stellar experience with the staff and the food.  We encountered a couple of waitresses who were obviously irritated with work at the time.  Between the sour attitudes and the drier than last time mac n' cheese, I'm actually not as excited about the idea of coming back.\\n\\nThe chicken?  Still great, of course. The service, not great at all.  The sides, only okay.  My companions loved their chicken sandwiches.  Like I said, the staple item maintained consistency.  So if you're interested in going and you've never had hot chicken before, I'd still do it.  But don't expect the royal treatment or even polite treatment.\", u\"Beyond delicious. The fried chicken dinner is enough for two! The Mac and cheese is fantastic and the service was great. Don't get discouraged if there's a line (there almost always is) it goes quick and it's worth the wait!!\", u\"The grits is perfect for me.  The eggs I can't even explain my brunch that my husband treated me to today. \\nCreamy grits gets me every time and let's not forget the cheese thinking about it I want more.\", u\"People always brag about this chicken so finally we were ready to try. We were warned about the extra hot so we knew what we were getting into. \\n\\nI order hot chicken and greens. He orders mild chicken with crunchy grits. I then ordered coleslaw to even out the burn. I thought I was going to die and it wasn't even extra hot. The coleslaw evened it out and also tasted delicious with the chicken. \\n\\nThe greens were super bland. They tasted like they blanched them and served them. No taste, spice nor saltiness... just nothing. I was waiting for a smoked turkey taste or pork or something. They were kind of crispy too. Odd and a lil disappointing. \\n\\n I would definitely go back to try more items. We were there during brunch but still got the chicken. The brunch plates looked sooo good too. We sat at the bar and saw everyone's plates. \\n\\nThe service was really great. \\n\\nSidebar: We went to the other Peaches down the street and waited like 30 mins. When we were finally seated, we saw only chicken wings with white sauce on the menu and were both like, hell nah! Then the server let us know we were at the wrong location. We weren't even mad at ourselves because we want to come back at a later date to try the seafood but yesterday was about CHICKEN.\"], u'195.Frankies 457 Spuntino': [u\"Solid antipasto, good cheeses,\\n\\nLovely back garden (with a garage type space that's used for pop-ups and other private events)\\n\\ndecent wine list, with decently priced stuff, nothing egregious\\n\\nAmazing Cavatelli with Sausage....\\n\\nBut man, oh man, those meatballs... I've had them everywhere - these maybe my favorite!!! Unreal!\", u'We were here for a small wedding and it was amazing. The decor is rustic modern with a very cozy feel. Lots of brick and wood and cast iron metal. \\n\\nThe wedding had about 75 people and tables were quite spread out. They had a cocktail hour with one bar in an old garage. \\n\\nThey also had a small bar area which was roomy enough for all. The cake and dessert was brought back to the bar area later in the day. \\n\\nWe loved the family style food and stared with beets and garden salad as well as a salumi and cheese plate. The bread and olive oil were delicious. The entrees were meatballs, gnocchi, fish, and roasted chicken. \\n\\nDessert was a chocolate torte and a wedding cake. \\n\\nPros:\\nNice staff\\nGreat food - everything we had was delicious\\nLove the atmosphere\\nDecor is very cool and hipster \\nNice big bar in the restaurant \\n\\nCons:\\nOne small bathroom for the entire wedding party\\nIf it rains it would be terrible \\nSun was very hot for certain tables \\n\\nI highly recommend this place. The food is enough to draw you in but the decor and ambience is a nice bonus.', u\"Had a wonderful experience at this charming and friendly restaurant. Made a reservation based upon the reviews and the fact it has a great outdoor dining area.\\nThe location is small, at least the interior, but it opens into an intimate brick walled dining area. It is shaded with vines and trellis and makes for a welcome green space to enjoy your meal in.\\nThe wait staff is exceptionally friendly and welcoming, (not an experience enjoyed everywhere in Brooklyn) and knowledgeable about the food being offered.\\nThe menu is simple, but executed in a manner that take advantage of what is seasonal and fresh. The receipts are classic's tweaked to take advantage of what is in the market that day.\\nI also wanted to mention the bar, the drink's especially the cocktails are interesting and my Sardegna Sour was refreshing without being overly sweet. The wine list is reasonably priced and has an emphases on Italians as you might imagine. \\nMy friend and I shared the Beet and Avocado Salad with Balsamic, tasty with right amount of tang. I had the sliced slow roasted rib eye, served cold with Arugula, Red Onion and Pecorino, it could have been a little more rare for my taste, however the meat was seasoned and tender, so no complaints in that regard. My friend had the Sweet Potato and Sage Ravioli in Parmesan Broth, I noticed her plate was wiped clean with the really great bread they bring you.\\nFor desert we shared the Red Wine Prunes with Marscarpone, they were good but I think could have been improved by flavoring the Marscarpone, with some lemon or other acid to add some contrast. They also have a nice selection of Rose's for summer.\\nI am really glad to have tried this restaurant and look forward to many more meals here.\", u\"I've been wanting to come here for years! Finally had dinner on a Sunday, the restaurant was not crowded. The tables are closely packed though, so if you like spaciousness, don't expect that here. Ordered the sage cocktail and Chianti - both delicious! The gnocchi was the softest I've ever tasted. The only downer with food was the side order of broccoli rabe - it came chopped, cold, in a small soup cup? That was a regretful choice. Otherwise, excellent.\", u\"We went to Frankie's for our 5 year anniversary dinner and were not disappointed! The complimentary bread is great, of course, then we had a crostini with ricotta and speck -delicious! Next, we tried the beets and avocado salad at the recommendation of the server. It didn't sound amazing, but it was. Then we each chose the cavatelli with hot sausage. Very tasty. (We were on the fence about sharing two different dishes, but ended up getting each of our first choice. If we did it again, we would get two different dishes because the cavatelli is a large portion and plenty for sharing). We finished the night with the creme brulee, the chocolate tart, and two cappuccinos.  Everything was excellent. \\n\\nMore info: Service was great. With no reservations, we arrived at 6pm on a Friday and were seated right away. I think you could wait quite a while depending on your arrival time. \\n\\nCan't wait to go again.\", u\"A local staple. Great food, especially the cavatelli & meatballs, the heirloom tomato salad and it was fantastic. The bartender makes a mean drink. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that the service has gotten slow because it is so busy. Let's call it a 4.5.\", u'As good as it gets. Delicious tuscan comfort in a cozy, intimate, brick walled atmosphere. Our group of 6 shared a lot of appetizers and pastas which was the way to go for our purposes. Will have to try the West Village location now - have heard this BK location is the \"lighter\" version.\\n\\nGreat for a small group, or a quiet night out on a weekday with a significant other.', u\"why is this place so hyped? Look at the kitchen. They have a way to boil pasta and make paninis. Everything else is not made on site. Portions are small and expensive. I do agree the source ingredients are very good. If you want to be full, order a panini. I ordered this rolled braised meat thing that was in tomato sauce. For over $20 i was expecting some garnish and side dishes to help provide color. It was just like that, hunk of meat with some sauce. Maybe I just don't get it.... feel free to enlighten me.\\n\\nAs a plus, this place is really close to Caputo's italian grocery store. I really recommend going there and then ... making your own food. haha\", u'We had our holiday party here and there\\'s really very little to complain about. With that said, I also wouldn\\'t rave about anything either.\\n\\nWe rented the little barn in the back of the restaurant for a private event.  We had about 40 people for a sitdown dinner that was served family style.  The food was tasty but not spectacular.  At almost $200/person, I was expecting a whole lot more.  We had some bread, cheese, and veggies, a couple of salads, 3 entrees (2 of which were pastas - our choice), and 2 desserts.  We also had house liquors and wine and a sad beer selection.  \\n\\nThe positives:\\n- the space was cute\\n- the location is pretty convenient unless you want to park\\n- the food was inoffensive\\n- order the ceasar salad, it\\'s actually really good\\n\\nThe negatives:\\n- they\\'re pretty popular (for reasons I don\\'t understand) so they\\'re kind of \"take it or leave it\" in their attitude.\\n- they have a hard stop at 11pm and no matter how much money you offer. they actually kick you out, not just stop serving you.\\n- the servers kept taking the half full platters of food away. I understand making space but the immigrant in me kept screaming \"WASTE!\"  Almost had a heart attack.\\n- the layout of the tables for our party was really awkward for conversation - we had two long tables (like the number 11). before dinner, unless you want to sit at the table, you\\'re relegated to the narrow entrance area.  The tables also meant you could really only speak with the people you are sitting next to.  Really hard to shout down 8 people to talk to someone at the other end.\\n\\nSo the hubs and I also looked into this space for our wedding and due to the limited size (we would have wanted to do the ceremony and reception in the same place) we went with another place in downtown Brooklyn.  Boy am I glad.', u\"Super cute place! I came here for a private event and really liked the atmosphere. The private room made me feel like I was sitting at a European vineyard. The food was really tasty. We started with a cheese and meat platter and some bread and Italian olive oil. Then they brought out a tasty salad in a light balsamic vinaigrette. After that came meatballs in a tasty marinara sauce. I didn't eat the meatball but I loved the sauce. After that was some delicious Cavatelli with Hot Sausage & Browned Sage Butter. I could have eaten until I passed out. The Gnocchi Marinara & Fresh Ricotta was very good too. We also had a nice fish dish, I believe it was Bronzino with fennel I think.\\n\\nI would definitely come back. It had a nice European like feel (very Italian),  romantic, nice date place. I would be very interested to see the wine menu as it's proposed as a wine bar. I only had some Pinot Grigio.\", u'I recently came here with a friend for lunch. We had a couple of the crostini which were delicious and the perfect bites to whet our appetites. We ordered the zucchini with pesto and pine nuts, it was SO good! I got the gnocchi with peas and guanciale. The gnocchi were a tiny bit gummy, but the flavor was excellent. Great service, nice vibe and a lovely patio out back. A really great little Italian restaurant in one of my favorite Brooklyn neighborhoods.', u'Cheese and cheese and cheese on evry dish. Small portions. Wait is so long, i wasnt sure if it was worth it. But they have a very cute backyard for the summer and glasshouse seating during the winter.', u\"Quaint cozy atmosphere and unique artesanal pastas and sauces. When you think of Italian cuisine, it's often a good amount of food. That's the only thing that was a bit of a bummer. It's on the pricey side for the portions and we left a little hungry. Otherwise, great location and fun local\\nspot in the neighborhood. Definitely will be back\", u'So, I had a friend in town who had the taste for Italian. This place was on my list so I decided to try it out. There is inside and outside dining along with bar seating. The weather was playing nice so we decided to sit outside. After reviewing the menu my friend said he didnt see anything on the menu he would try. Our waiter proceeded over and we told him it was our 1st time and he made some recommendations. We ordered the ceaser and octopus salad and the cavatelli with sausage. I had the grapefruit and sparkling wine for my choice of drink and my friend ordered the cura that was made with tequila and I believe amaretto.Our drinks came out with apologies after a while due to a back up at the bar. The Cura was really good. The octopus was cooked perfectly to the right texture. Now the cavatelli with sausage was so good. The sausage had a little spice to it and was ohhh so good. Halfway through our meal our waiter Josh, who was amazing, stopped over an offered us a glass of wine on the house for being 1st timers. Nice touch. Did thus make me feel like I was getting extra attention, even if i was not. Absolutely!!! My friend had the cheesecake and I took a bite. It had a pound cake/cheesecake taste to me. Overall, I enjoyed the staff and the food. Will I go back? Without hesitation.', u\"This place is delicious! At this point, I only order one thing - the pasta with sausage and butter and sage sauce. It is perfection. I haven't been as excited by their sandwiches and other options, though the pastas that I have tasted are usually good. I think the prices are a bit high and we have had a server or two who have been a little unfriendly- but the food was good, which is most important!\", u'Amazing food, service, and atmosphere. One of my favorite spots. Highly recommended starting out with the meatballs and then getting the cavatelli and sausage.', u\"The food we had here was amazing and the outdoor seating is beautiful. The octopus dandelion salad is enough to come back for itself, and the linguini shrimp special was memorable. More than all of that, I want to thank the waitstaff.\\n\\nMy mom came here with me last night for my birthday. She was recently diagnosed with cancer and because of her treatment her sense of taste changes everyday, and she's started losing her hearing. This makes it confusing and embarrassing for her to go out many places, but she really wanted to celebrate with me, so she came out. \\n\\nOur waiter was really sweet, and really patient, and accommodated what probably sounded like really weird requests, no questions asked. This was particularly notable since it has not been true in many places we've gone. \\n\\nSo all in all, the food was great, but the service really made our night.\", u\"Four stars???? Come on Yelpers! Are you on something? Ridiculous. This place has the hype and price tag that are just way off the mark just as a 4 star rating. First, the service: 6 red flags from start to finish from not properly making drinks to not bringing two different bottles of wine for each couple, to cold broccoli rabe, to not splitting the checks, etc. The food: the meatballs were not that great and had a few rubbery, grissly pieces-- yuck. The sausage: too salty, hacked up into cylinders on pasta that didn't taste homemade. Weak sauce. Caesar not memorable. Tiramisu not anything special. I feel like a basketball player benched during a game in eating here instead of eating REAL red sauce Italian American like Don Peppe's, Emelio's Battalo, Ruby Rosa, Parkside, Tony di Napoli, etc. Just can't believe people eat this up. It's a poser, a wannabee. Give me a freaking break. Smh. Booooo.\", u\"I walked in here tonight because I was so hungry and craved Italian food but the hostess lied to me that the wait was 1+ while the bar was open because I was by myself.she profiled me which I could tell but anyways I am\\nGlad I didn't eat here !\", u'Five stars for food, one star for service.  I\\'m still scratching my head about what happened here, and hating myself a little since I know I\\'ll go back (those meatballs!) even though I\\'d prefer to stand on ceremony and avoid this place.\\n\\nWe ordered a $65 bottle of wine. My husband tasted it and proclaimed it \"good.\" I then tasted the wine and it was awful - turned and not good at all. The other couple we were with agreed it was bad and we called over the waiter.  The manager and waiter tasted it, said it was fine, and offered no concession.  Two of us ordered wine to replace the terrible wine that was not drinkable...they didn\\'t bat an eyelash and certainly didn\\'t offer any customer friendly measures.\\n\\nIt felt like a complete lack of customer service, and their attitude was not apologetic.  Not cool at all!'], u'135.L & B Spumoni Gardens': [u\"Oh, where do I start?! SUPER Satisfied and stuffed after my dining experience here. *Burp* Took six containers to go after my meal, so much food left over. Just couldn't eat anymore.\\n\\nI came here with family and friends to celebrate my sister's birthday and we opted for the Chef's Tasting menu.  Chose our entrees and pasta dishes (2 of each) and the rest is their standard. \\n\\nGiven we had not been here before and noticed the huge line for the Pizza, had to try.  While NOT included in the tasting - the restaurant allowed me to order a small pizza pie to share as an additional starter (for the kids). The pizza is excellent!  Tomato sauce was robust - hint of sweet and herbs.  The slices were thin and the highlight was the dough. The dough was super soft inside yet had a nice crispy crust on the outside.  \\n\\nThe tasting menu featured appetizers of: rice balls (ground beef, veg, cheese-y goodness, so delish), Baked clams were a standout (breadcrumbs and sprinkled parmesan, then a fried shrimp and cocktail shrimp platter combined. Second serving was the ginormous salad plate.  We're talking a mound of bib lettuce, sliced tomatoes (long side), red onions, olives, all topped with fresh mozzarella. There was so much cheese, you could barely see the salad beneath. I am a fan. \\n\\nThe two pastas we selected were the penne a la vodka and the linguine with white clam sauce. Both were al dente and excellent. Penne with the sauce was rich and slightly creamy.  The linguine was perfect, loads of garlic and olive oil.  The clams were small but plenty. \\n\\nFor the entrees (you can choose two - steak, veal, pork or fish) - we chose the steak (medium) and the pork chops. OMG, must see the photos... the pork chops were a standout in taste and appearance. Balsamic type sauce yet sweet notes of raspberries and herbs.  It was drizzled all around the massive bone-in chops. Super moist pork chops.  And the sauce didn't over power the natural flavors coming from the meat. Loved both entrees - highly recommend both.\\n\\nBy the time it came to dessert, all part of the Chef's Tasting... boy was I stuffed.  I did not have room to eat it but I was happy to try!  The dessert platter had two slices of cheesecakes and chocolate cakes. Also featured tartufo, sliced for visual presentation, lots of chocolate sprinkles everywhere and four ice cream cones on the sides.  All complimenting the mountains of gelato.  The waiter was notified it was my sister's birthday so they decorated the platter with a Happy Birthday message. On top of all this deliciousness were the cherries and a lit candle.\\n\\nOverall, everyone was happily stuffed!  Chef's Tasting is a great way to try them out but comes w/ a hefty price (but it also allows a table reservation.  However, if you're willing to stand on line and wait for a table then just order a la carte - but order to share, portions are generous.  By the way, we did a party of 5 for the tasting but it easily fed all 7 of us and still had leftovers.\", u'I was born and raised in Brooklyn. And I\\'m a pizza snob. There\\'s really only one reason you go to L&B: for their \"saucy\" square Sicilian pizza. Don\\'t look for ambiance, or stellar service. Go on a nice day, order your squares and eat outside. And don\\'t compare their pizza to anything else; this Sicilian pie is crafted upside down: crust, cheese, then sauce and grated Parmesan.\\n\\nUnique. And delicious. Go.', u\"The cheese melts into the pizza dough. Worth the long ride from Manhattan.\\nTry the square Sicily pizza.\\nLine was short, employees were very nice and prices are really OK. Money to value - I've got more joy that I've paid for\", u\"Still one of the best, if not the best square Sicilian slice of pizza I've ever had!\\n\\nIf you're visiting L&B, then there's really only one thing you need to order to understand what they're all about ... and that's their famous square Sicilian pizza. There's just something about L&B's square slices. Whether it's the extra dough, the tangy tomato sauce or just the fact it's unlike any other pizza in NYC, there's something special about it and it's no secret to everyone in Brooklyn.\\n\\nSure, they serve your regular NYC cheese slices. I've never tried it before and there's a good reason for it --- because their square slices are that dang good! Besides their pizza, L&B is also famous for their spumoni (aka Italian ice/ice cream), as well as, homemade ices, regular and soft serve ice cream. If you're not satisfied yet, they also serve pastas, heroes and a plethora of Italian dishes in their indoor dining area. But who are we kidding?! You're here for the square slices, and if it's a warm day, the Spumoni (Rainbow being the most popular flavor)!\\n\\nAs for the environment, L&B has a large outdoor seating area and a private parking lot. The parking lot is not big and tends to fill up quickly on busy days/weekends. Many folks tend to double park outside of L&B to pick up Sicilian pies as well so the area gets very crowded.\\n\\nBottom line --- L&B's square slices are worth every penny. Although they aren't big slices, their unique flavor and texture make it some of the best pizza in NYC. Also, you get a much better deal if you decide to get a pie at 12 slices for $24 instead of an individual slice at $2.75.\", u\"Just had lunch here with my partner for the first time. \\n\\n\\nFood: pizza: we both had a square and a slice (triangle). Slice was alright. Super thin and felt like I was eating dollar pizza from the city. Square was very very good. Not too much cheese on it and the sauce was fresh and full of flavor. If I go back I would only get the square. My partner agrees with me.\\n\\nFood: icecream: we had spumoni for the first time. Spumoni is a creamy ice. It's in between a slushy and ice cream. Taste like a frozen Wendy's frosty. He had the rainbow (mix of vanilla, pistachio and chocolate) and I had just chocolate. Sooooooo good! So much flavor and yet so light! It didn't make me feel like I had a huge desert even though it was full of flavor. Must try this when you're here!\\n\\nService: quick and easy. Line wasn't too long and they give you the pizza right away when you order. \\n\\nParking: easy. There is a parking lot which was full but there are street parking all over. \\n\\nAtmosphere: relaxed large outdoor patio with picnic tables lots of seating even indoor seating.\", u\"This place is amazing! Pizza is on point. Must do the square Sicilian pie. Nice and soft and then crispy on the bottom. Must try the spumoni (vanilla chocolate and pistachio). Prices aren't horrible. Also inside dining area with entrees very reasonable.\", u\"Okay so I'm guilty of getting into the car late night and driving out to spumoni gardens due to some cravings of not just pizza but the best pizza you'll ever have. I have been coming here for years and not once was I disappointed.\\n\\nI always go for the Sicilian slice, or should I say slices. I usually eat about 4 or 5 slices in one shot because I just can't get over how yummy it is.\\n\\nThe dough is always so fluffy and soft with just the right amount cheese and sauce. And speaking of sauce, I don't know what amazingness they put into the sauce but it is delicious!\\n\\nJust a tip if you're getting a couple of slices it is cheaper in the long run if you get a pie.\\n\\nI love the atmosphere here all year long. There are outdoor picnic style tables which are so nice for summer nights and in the winter you can sit inside and be toasty and still enjoy it. I also love that when you pull up to the place there are cars double parked and families all around it just has a unique vibe to it. A happy vibe.\\n\\nOh, and did I mention the spumoni??? \\nIt is a must try! I promise if you have it once you'll have it every time. I love this place and will forever be a customer here\", u\"Eh, I don't get the rave reviews from all the Coney Islanders.\\n\\nWent to the boardwalk, then took a one stop train trip to L&B. What we found was that there's either indoor seating with waiter service, and a full menu, or outdoor seating, which seemingly only has access to the pizzeria and the frozen ices/ice cream etc. I actually saw some people eating calamari while sitting outside, and I'm not sure how or where they got them, but there might be a way to eat non pizza items while sitting outside.\\n\\nThe pizza spot has two basic options: either the regular pies, or the sicilian pies. You can order individual slices, but you'll only have access to plain/cheese. If you want to get a whole pie however, you can add your own toppings, which include some things like pepperoni, mushroom, etc.\\n\\nHonestly, I thought it was just fine. I came here because I saw someone on reddit raving about L&B, but it turned out to be just fine. I liked the sicilian pizza because there wasn't much cheese on it, but overall there's no way I would come all the way from Manhattan just to come here again. If I lived nearby, perhaps it would be a different story.\\n\\nCard minimum is $10\", u'This is a Brooklyn Institution. I think far too often the term institution is miss used to refer to places that are very iconic but not institutions anymore. Places like Gramaldis have amazing food, critically acclaimed, long lines, pictures with celebrities but sometimes seem more like tourist sites than restaurant. L&B is different this is a neighborhood institution. \\n\\nI went there on a Friday at 9:30 and it was packed. There is a large outside area and as well a large inside area both parts were fairly full. I ordered pickup and there was even quite a few people waiting there. This is the kind of place where you see all kinds of people fromt he neighborhood teenagers with friends, young adults before parties, families with children, People celebrating birthdays. Anyone and everyone can come here. \\n\\nThe pizza itself was pretty good too. I got a box of the square and man can that fill you up! The dough is more like a bread but it is well made. I got pepperoni and they did a good job of not putting too many. The cheese was also good. If you are comparing this place to Prince street (the other most famous square) its different. L&B crust is denser and more bread like. The pepperonis are more traditional not the small cups. However, that does not mean this is not a really delicious meal.', u'L&B Spinoni Gardens\\nNY BK Gravesend\\n1pm Saturday 22nd July 2017\\nFour Stars\\n\\nIts been on my pizza bucket list for quite some time and it did not disappoint. I had two square slices. The bread was thick, soft, with a bit of crunch. The sauce was sweet, savory, with a bright finish.  The cheese was melted and delicious. No Complaints here.  I also had their homemade tiramisu ice cream which melts fast.', u\"Went here for dinner after an afternoon on the beach. It's a bit far but I do think it was worth it. L&B has that old school Italian American vibe and is a good place for both a quick bite to eat and a sit down meal. The restaurant is split into three sections: there's a pizza window and outdoor sit-down area, an indoor Italian takeout with mostly the same menu as the sit-down but slightly different prices, and finally the sit-down restaurant. We decided on the sit-down and it was a busy Friday night rush but they seated us right away. Atmosphere was great, felt very family style. The servers were busy but friendly and seemed to know a lot of the frequent customers. Coming here did sort of feel like we were in a scene from a movie and my boyfriend and I joked about what we would say if the Godfather approached us. \\n\\nAs for the food, we ordered a Sicilian slice ($2.75) because we were told that was the speciality, an eggplant parm pasta dish (~$15), fried calamari (~$14), and homemade spumoni (~$4). \\n\\nThe pizza was, as expected, the best part of the meal. As a born and bred New Yorker I LOVE pizza but I've never been a huge fan of Sicilian slices. They've never made sense to me, all dough not enough cheese and sauce. This slice changed my mind. The generous amount t of mozzarella was hidden under a perfect amount of sauce and topped with parmesan, which added that nice extra salty bite. The dough itself was delicious and perfectly chewy and the crust, which even in the best slice tends to be bland, was super flavorful with a surprisingly delicious bitterness from the burnt edges. Overall, a perfect pizza experience. \\n\\nThe calamari was also delicious and they gave us an extremely generous portion that could have easily fed a group of 4. I suppose that accounts for the price but in my mind the calamari wasn't anything special and was a bit pricey. \\n\\nThe eggplant pasta dish was also perfectly cooked. This place certainly does al dente right and I think the pasta was the best part of the dish. The eggplant and sauce and extra cheesey cheese were nothing to scoff at either though. \\n\\nFor dessert we figured we needed to get the homemade spumoni (after all it's the namesake) and it didn't disappoint. I'm still not entirely sure what the flavors are supposed to be but it was like creamy Italian ices and again they gave us a very generous portion. \\n\\nOverall, I would definitely go back and recommend to others even though it's way out in Brooklyn. But next time I think I'll skip the sit-down and just go for a slice of that amazing Sicilian pizza.\", u'I love this pizza!!! The pizza is delicious with the crust perfect. The middle a little doughy and the sauce is nice and sweet. Everything is delicious.  I can seriously eat a whole pie.. no shame at all. I will come back every time.\\nI traveled from queens just to come here.\\nThe restaurant side is clean and quick. Our waiter was great. He gave us suggestions and helped us to the T.\\n\\n\\nYou gotta try it out!!!', u'As a kid growing up in a Brooklyn we got pizza nearly once a week, but going to Spumoni\\'s was a special treat, and it is still amazing when I get to go today! Of course get the square slice and a rainbow spumoni. A square pie with 12 slices cost $24 dollars, and totally hit the spot for me, 4 of my siblings, and two of our boos the other day. As you have probably gathered by now, L & B puts their sauce on top of the cheese (I think some people call this grandma style pizza, I\\'ve always know it as an L & B slice). I love this because I\\'m a huge fan of a good saucy pizza and a pet peeve of mine is when the cheese gets cold and stiff too quickly (this won\\'t happen with their square slice).\\n\\nThe bathroom is in a weird and somewhat off putting location (need to go around the back of the joint). The place does get packed, but generally people are in and out pretty quickly. We have always sat outside, though it\\'s worth popping inside to see the photos on the wall of the Sopranos, etc. Speaking of the mafia, it has always been my assumption the owners are involved (disclaimer: this is an assumption). As a kid when I asked why we couldn\\'t go here every pizza night being that it was unanimously the family favorite, my parents always said it was because the owners \"did mean things.\" One of the owners was sadly recently shot in his backyard, and the deets are a little fuzzy. That part of this place sucks, but the pizza is boss, and sometimes it even tastes better cold the next day.', u\"I'm Irish. What the hell is spumoni? And it grows in a garden? OK.\\n\\nSpumoni is great. Some kind of tri-colored, ice milk who knows what. Really great. Green is pistachio, I think. Great stuff.\\n\\nParking lot is PACKED. I walked up quick to the window, got the goods and split. Been there 3 times.\\n\\nRecommended.\", u\"I can see why people flock from all over to get pizza from this place! I absolutely love their square slices, I heard it's way way better than the regular slice! It's not just about the right amount of cheese to sauce ratio but their bread is so amazing!! I usually leave the crust whenever I eat pizza but I could not resist eating the entire thing when I was here. \\n\\nAlso do get their ice cream! I got the rainbow Spumoni which comes with Vanilla, Chocolate and Pitaschio! So worth it and it was really yummy!\", u\"Went here with a large group of people after tons of recommendations from locals and transplants alike. I, for the most part was neither disappointed or impressed. \\nDon't get me wrong it wasn't horrible but just okay. Another pizza joint in NYC. \\nPro: I love the nostalgia of this place. Old school, old folks and locals. That I love. It looked like it probably did years ago and yet still looked updated. The place is busy, servings are generous. I mean, that monster dessert platter?! Even our large group ( many of them foodies and food lovers in general) couldn't finish it. Service was awesome. Despite the busy-ness and it was only a Tuesday, we got our stuff promptly. Despite, the waiter missing an order. The white wine was generous and overall not expensive.\\nCons: AC. Pizza and wine means sweat and bloat for me. And in the middle of summer I was a pile of nasty sweaty funk. And trust me it wasn't only me. The food was okay-and yes, we ordered the Sicilian. It was just regular pizza, everyone rants about the sauce. I just thought it was okay, a little sweet for me. And the crust was a little too malleable.\\nOverall? I'm all about going to strong still standing businesses and perhaps it was an off day. This place, after all is mentioned on varies blogs for its pizza. However, it wasn't for me.\", u\"Best pizza place in Brooklyn and I'm not even exaggerating. I'm so glad I live like a 10 minute drive away and can get it conveniently. I love their Sicilian slice! Perfect amount of tomato sauce. Price is ~$2.75 a slice which is the norm. There is outdoor seating which is nice for a summer night. Plus, there's a parking lot which is definitely a plus because we all know how much of a pain finding parking is. Their Spumoni ice is also very popular but I'm not a fan of it. My friend loves it though! I prefer the regular vanilla one but I guess I'm basic so don't mind me. Anyways, next door is an actual restaurant with authentic Italian food. It's also bomb!! Overall, I highly recommend L&B's if you're ever in the Brooklyn area. Must try!\", u'An extra star for the square pizza, which is unlike any other Sicilian style I have had.  In my experience, square pizza was always heavy, and in most cases greasy. However, I was pleasantly surprised, in that this was light and almost airy.  The taste was very nice, with quality ingredients.\\n\\nI also had a chance to get the Spumoni, and I will never get anything smaller than a large.  Very tasty blend of chocolate, vanilla, and pistachio ice cream.\\n\\nTheir arancini is also worth the trip. I asked for mine with marinara sauce.  Very satisfying.\\n\\nIf you are looking for fine dining, impeccable service, and beautiful surroundings,  look elsewhere, but if all you want is a great example of Italian American fare, give it a try.  You will not be disappointed.  And the price is right.', u'It does not get any more classic, old-school Brooklyn than this. Well worth the hike for their pizza. The menu is quite large and not everything is good, so this is not a place to experiment or where you want to go off the beaten path. Stick to the classics, you will not regret it.', u\"This is my go-to Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. Their portions are huge and really worth the price. I usually get the carbonara pasta to share! The downside is all the oil on the bottom. Another must from this place is their garlic bread. They're usually gone within minutes. Everyone I know raves about their square pie but it's not mind blowing amazing to me. But do try their Spumoni ice cream!! \\n\\nThis place is perfect for big groups because of the huge portions. The restaurant itself is pretty big but can get really crowded on weekends (especially in the summertime!) It's private parking lot is a bonus.\"], u'185.Cafe Madeline': [u\"Wow the selections, you'll be reading the menu for a little while so start before you approach the ordering area!\\n\\nI had the bowl with chickpeas, sweet potatoes, spicy hummus, fresh and gooey goat cheese, greens, and adorned with a watermelon radish. It was so tasty and healthy, thank you for infusing my day with this wonderous pleasure! \\n\\nAlso had an almond milk cappuccino, which was enjoyable, a bit cold for my preference but a lovely taste. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is okay - a little smokey inside as the kitchen is in the same room as most of the dining area, but there's an outside area and a back room to choose from as well. \\n\\nIt's not cheap but it's not crazy expensive. Unless you get something small (like a biscuit sandwich), expect to play like $15-20. \\n\\nI can't wait to come back and order more of the delicious foods on this menu - updates to come!\", u\"Stepped in around 9 am on a summer Sunday for the first time:\\n\\nLine elongated in no time but moved quickly. Space is deff cramped but opens up more at the back. Immediately you hear/see the kitchen behind the person taking your order at the counter.\\n\\nOrdered the APC, chive biscuit sandwich, almond croissant and rose pedal latte to go. Food took some time but here's the verdict :\\n\\nThe chive biscuit though it tasted good, not worth the price point. A bit dry and demanding of a thirst quencher - luckily I had the rose latte iced, which Btw had the right amount of caffeine, ice, rose flavor and topped off with crushed rose pedals. For my desi folks out there, it's basically a iced latte with a bit of rooh-afza. As for the APC, it was delicious! Generous amount of beef pastrami, and avacado. I was particularly happy about their choice of bread, nice and soft on the inside and not tough to tear. The sweet almond croissant was the perfect ending to this Sunday breakfast. \\n\\nGiven they are all organic and possibly one of the first few grub spots to gentrification to the area , I can understand the price point but not all items are worth the dough for example the chive biscuit sandwich. Staff was friendly and really 3.5 but overall feeling good after the food so I'd recommend this place!\", u\"I love this place !!!!! I I get completely excited every time I go here and keep dragging all my friends here as well! I love their avacado toast, it's Huge, and they actually put a lot of avacado on the toast - you get so much for your money unlike some other places where the avacado toast is little and flat. \\n\\nI also enjoy how beautiful all their good looks, no matter what dish I have ordered, it always came out looking beautiful and perfectly delicious ! \\n\\nThe atmosphere is layed back, and there are so many dishes to choose from, I never get bored ! Absolutely one of my favorite cafes in Brooklyn !\", u'Been wanting to come here and finally did!!! Their food looks amazing on yelp pics and IG pics. The cafe is actually bigger than what the reviews seem to say.. they have a back section.\\n\\nOnce u enter, u are greeted by the front staff at the register, u take the menu, grab a seat and then when ure rdy u go place ur order. They will call u to pick up ur drinks at the front and will bring u ur food to ur table. There are SO many options to choose from on their menu!\\n\\nI ordered \"not ur grandma\\'s bfast\" and my bf ordered the crossiant salmon and turkey sandwich. Also ordered the rose petal latte.\\n\\nI thought the drink was WAY too sweet for my liking.. but then again, i stopped drinking coffee for a few wks now so maybe im not used to it. The staff was nice enough to switch it out for me.\\n\\nAs for our meal, we both enjoyed it so much! It was definitely heavy and filling but at the same time looked so good and tasted yummy.\\n\\nWe did notice they barely had AC on and it was VERY hot outside.. and just muggy inside.. the place also smelled like cooked food everywhere. Vents werent that great so ur clothes WILL smell!\\n\\nOther than that, its definitely one of the better brunch spots ive been to.', u'Ive come here twice and got the avocado toast both times. The first time there was a TON of avocado on the toast. The second time they skimped me (maybe only in comparison to the first time). The second time I chose to dine in and got the orange lemonade which was nice and refreshing along with the yellow fin avocado toast. It was good. You do end up paying about a $6-$8 premium was the 8-9 little cubes of yellow fin but it taste fresh and its the middle of brooklyn so i guess its just par for the course. \\n\\nMy partner got french toast and what she described as one of the best ice coffees shes ever had. \\n\\nService was quick. Its not exactly wait service. You order at the front and some brings your food to whatever table you sit at and they check in with you once just to make sure youre alright.', u'Terrible - here\\'s why:\\n1. Toby roaster coffee is not good quality coffee, very cheap quality. \\n2. I ordered an omelet w goat cheese, onions, tomatoes, avocado. It cost $15.00 too expensive. I got the wrong order. Then when I showed the recipe I got the same order but withgoat cheese, onions (raw), tomatoes, avocado thrown on tip of a scrambled egg. This time, without the toast. \\n3. I ordered a cappuccino - small, but got a large. The only difference btw a small and large is amount of milk. \\n4. I then ordered another cappuccino, this time I got what looked like a Cortado... When I showed how little it was, barista said \"yup 8 ounces\". I took a picture and would post it here if I could. I feel like goldilocks! \\n5. I have been going here since they opened and each time they are poor. I keep giving them another chance, hoping... Never again. \\n\\nThey have the right idea, just very poor execution. \\n\\nNever again.', u\"I liked everything that I tried here so far, you really can't go wrong. They have various sandwiches, salads, grain bowls, and breakfast dishes that you can have any time of the day. So many interesting drinks to choose from as well. The service here is impeccable, they are always greeting you with a smile, and very helpful if you want any suggestions. You pick up your drinks at the counter, and they bring over the food to you. There aren't too many outlets around, but I still enjoy coming here to study. They do have free wi-fi. Also, it used to smell very smokey inside, but it seems that they have gotten better ventilation now. I would recommend this place for sure.\", u\"I haven't even tasted the food yet! I'm waiting on it! However the smore's latte was so delicious I had to run to Yelp! Immediately upon taking a sip my mind said... I'm going to need another one of these before I leave. \\n\\nLet's talk about the taste... so no it doesn't taste like a smore at all... but what it does taste like can't be compared to anything you or I have ever had at any Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts. This is REAL coffee, it's frothy, thick, rich, sweet with a stubble hint of mocha. I'm in love...! \\n\\n I'm back! Second time in one week and I've officially committed to coming here once a week until I try the entire menu! I'm convinced they can do no wrong! The food is so fresh and unlike your normal breakfast place. Everything here feels like it came straight from the farm to your plate. \\n\\nNot only is the food good but it's good for you! That's a combination you just can't pass up! Try it this weekend! You might catch me in the corner stuffing my face.\", u\"At first, I couldn't find the storefront because the name isn't there on the awning. I figured it out since it was the only brunch place on the block. The place was packed and I was confused how everything worked. So basically you order and find your seat. You get your drink by the counter but they will bring your dish to your table. Plenty of seating in the back but the table are small. We ordered 3 dish and 2 latte. There was almost no room to put everything. I got the oatmeal and rose petal latte. The rose petal latte looked nice but was bitter because of the petals so I didn't really like it. My oatmeal latte had lots of nuts in it. Awesome thing they got was coffee on tap. Food was very fresh and looked vibrant. There is a fridge with large selection of drinks that I don't really see in the stores. I recommend this place if you're looking to have a quick brunch. There are people who would work on their laptops but I find it too noisy for all that. Just saying.\", u\"Food is fine, if overpriced. Good selection of baked goods, sandwiches, salads. (Although a lot of their items don't appear on the menu, but are posted on sheets of paper stuck randomly on the walls, which can be a bit confusing.)\\n\\nThe main issue is the ventilation system, or lack thereof. It seems like there is CONSTANTLY smoke coming from the kitchen area and nowhere for it to go. The back room would be a perfectly place to sit and chat with friends or do work, if it weren't for the fact that the air literally stings your eyes and sets off coughing fits. If you spend any amount of time sitting in that area, you'll also come away with your clothes and hair saturated with a gross burnt smell.\\n\\ntl;dr if you sit outside you should be fine\", u'This place offers really delirious sandwiches. I had a business meeting here and ordered food. It\\'s a little out of the way for me which is the only reason why this isn\\'t my \"go to favorite spot\". The wait for your order can be a little long but it\\'s worth it. Whenever I get a chance to picnic at Prospect park I make sure to stop here and get a sandwich or two first. The food here is a little pricey but you are getting quality ingredients. The Cafe is cute and comfy with extra room in the back. I wish this place existed back when I lived in the area. I am a fan.', u\"This place is my classic favorite for brunch. It doesn't have bottomless drinks but its still amazing for their food! I've been going here since its opened and trying to explore more of their menu. \\n\\nToday my boyfriend and I got the croissant burger. I had it with roasted turkey and my boyfriend had it with lamb. Because I come here often, the staff always invites me very happily. One of my favorite places in my neighborhood.\", u'What can I say this place is the real deal. I have eaten here numerous times and the food is consistently fresh, flavourful, and healthy. The food is SO good that I can overlook the lack of air conditioning and the prices which are high are justifiable. \\n\\n\\nService is always friendly and professional. This is a short review because you just must check it out.', u'Tremendous sandwiches, nitro coffee, and kombucha on tap. I would suggest avoiding during lunchtime peak hour though, as it gets very busy and there is not much seating.', u'Beautiful brekke breakfast bowls and hearty cups of coffee with lovely outdoor seating. My morning place in Brooklyn.', u'I don\\'t really know where to start describing this place. I like it because they serve simple savory, food of decent quality using a lot of \"whole\" foods. I also think they have pretty good coffee although I like Quathra\\'s a wee better. \\n\\nThey just have SO MUCH STUFF though. Large smoothie menus, all kinds of espresso drink and tea concoctions, breakfast bowls, sammiches, pastries etc. etc. Instead of having one or two of something they will continually offer a billion versions of it seemingly. \\nNormally, I feel like that would be a bad thing in most places but since they do have SO many good things here, the fact that they also have some \"whatever\" items is OK. \\n\\nThe slightly spicy egg / cheddar biscuit is a MUST HAVE. Their grain bowls are large and tasty too.', u'Excellent spot for fresh and healthy food ! Their rose petal latte is my favorite ! Nice presentation, fast and quality service ! Definitely recommend this place !', u\"Excellent clean food so much to choose from didn't know where to start. But i got the stuffed french toast and eggs over easy with avocado. Im not a breakfast girl but i must say its the best i had at a diner in a very long time. Everything was so fresh\", u\"I like Cafe Madeline mostly because they're a coffice and there aren't many cafes like that around this part of town. \\n\\nI think the food ordering process is a little overwhelming and messy as you have to order by the counter, pick up your coffee right there but then they bring the food to you wherever you're sitting. \\n\\nThere's usually a line to order but the menus are at the register so you actually have to wait till you get there before checking out the menu. Which means making everyone wait for you to figure out what you might want to eat. \\n\\nI am a fan of the crispy Eggs platter and the French plate. Both Super solid and healthy breakfast option. I also love their fresh squeezed juices. \\n\\nThey are a little overpriced but I assume it incorporates the fact that a lot of people end up working there for hours without ordering anything. \\n\\nI think occasionally the staff may have a little attitude but I think if the ordering process might change, they might be less overwhelmed.\", u\"I'm a big fan of Cafe Madeline. The staff is always super friendly and what's not to love about healthy food that actually tastes delicious? It's a bit too pricey to frequent as often as I'd like. Let's be honest, if I could have lunch from here errday I would. But the creative menu and hospitality are definitely worth the walk over and the extra bucks. \\n\\nThey also have the cutest little bear cookies and make a mean cold brew. Out of all of the little spots on the Cortelyou strip, Cafe Madeline is by far my favorite.\"], u'147.Parkside': [u\"Ah update! \\n\\nSo I've been to Parkside several times now and here's my update:\\n\\n5 stars for the food: potato pizza w/ pistachio pesto was delicious and it can be made vegan, just order without cheese. The potatoes are perfectly seasoned and sliced with the just the right amount of thickness.\\n\\nAvocado crostini- like a petit avo toast. Packed with the creamy goodness of avocado and that hint of lime to maximize the flavor.\\n\\nEggplant crostini- simply amazing. What's in there!? I taste a hint of balsamic vinegar? Roasted red pepper? Idk but it's terrific\\n\\n5 stars for the ambiance: I've only been at night, so I've had the full effect of dim lights, cozy and intimate setting.\\n\\n5 stars for the bartenders: Billy! He's great. \\n\\nIt's rare that an establishment excels in food and the bar, but Parkside has it figured out. It's quickly becoming a favourite and I can't wait to return.\", u\"Okay so most times as a Brooklynite if you're craving a slice, you normally go to your tried and true greasy spot for a big azz slice that'll get you right for life.\\n\\nParkside is a bit different - you go there when you wanna be a lil fancy about your pizza consumption; when you wanna actually contemplate life and pizza for a moment.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Well-stocked bar including some rare liqueurs is a welcome sight as you enter.\\n- Menu has a great amount of variety. The list of crostini, pizzas (red and white), wine, and beer, is more than adequate. My ricotta crostini with honey was quite good, as was the margherita pie.\\n- Great for solo dining, date night, and chillin with friends. The ambience is soft and inviting amidst the hubbub of commerce along Flatbush Ave.\\n- *Hat tip to the Abruzzo they have on the menu - it's delicious.\\n- Clean layout, with barkeeps constantly polishing glasses.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Music selection could be more diverse. Maybe it was the night i went, and as much as i adore the 80s, more obscure joints from that decade just weren't doing it for me.\\n\\nOverall, a solidly good experience. i'd def return.\\n\\n*Tip: They give you nice white cloth napkins with your silverware, AND black paper napkins for a reason. Do your parents proud and don't be a savage - USE the black napkins to wipe up, and leave the white ones in your lap.\", u\"Excellent, excellent pizza.\\n\\nI took my girlfriend on a whirlwind weekend of pizza, including some famous spots including Grimaldi's and Juliana's by the Brooklyn Bridge. Parkside was far and away her favorite. Not only that, she said it was the best pizza she had ever had. Now, she's from DC by way of Florida. That's not exactly pizza mecca. But as someone who has almost always been NYC adjacent if not in the city itself, I have to say this place is so good. \\n\\nPizza, I am always up for and cocktails are my preferred method of alcohol consumption. Put 'em together and I am a happy camper. \\n\\nSo far, I've tried the sopressata, ruby, and lamb sausage pie. Each was better than the next. And with the drinks, I have had no complaints about them. I tend to stay with the more fruity options and they all have been able to get me a bit tipsy, without having the harsh bite of alcohol.\", u\"Parkside is a hole in the wall place conveniently located on Flatbush Ave by Parkside st. For me, it is the perfect place for a date as they have tasty drinks and fresh baked pizzas - who doesn't enjoy that?! I've yet to have a cocktail from Parkside that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. I've had the sandy summer (jalape\\xf1o tequila with ginger and agave) and the witch doctor with gin, ginger, lemon, and honey. The ingredients taste high quality and the drinks are reasonably priced (~$11 each). \\n\\nNow onto the food: their pizzas are delicious. Freshly baked, fresh cheese and tomato sauce. Simplistic perfection! I also ordered the roasted zucchini and summer squash which was flavorful and well seasoned. Next time I will have to try the mushroom or lamb sausage pizza (my date had a less adventurous palate than I do!) Highly recommend this place especially for those visiting Flatbush.\", u\"Let's keep this short... I'm new to the neighborhood and this spot is purely addictive! \\n\\n1. Billy's drinks are on point ALL OF THE TIME\\n2. Happy hour every night at 10:30 until\\n3. Who doesn't like good drinks and brick-oven pizza\\n4. Add the meatballs to your meal\\n5. Thank me later\", u\"I came here with a bunch of friends on a Saturday night to hang, so naturally we ordered the shit out of the menu, pizza's, salads, drinks, shots. So my assessment about their food is not based on one or two dishes. \\nAll the pizza's were mediocre at best, if u didn't eat it hot, straight out of the oven it became inedible, soggy in the middle, and bland in taste, \\nThe drinks were so so, not to complain or rave about. \\nBut the service was amazing, our waiter was very attentive and patient, I can see how people would come back just for the Service. \\n\\nPs. The few blocks around this restaurant is still a bit shady, (I didn't feel too safe walking to my car) but it's better then what it used to be.\", u'Great neighborhood restaurant by Prospect Park. The front area has a bar and some small tables and the back has a few larger tables. We were seated immediately on a Thursday evening. I got the brussel sprouts to start, which were decent. The three bruschettas were good as an appetizer. I had the prosciutto and arugula pizza and the cinnamon roll bread pudding as desert and the ros\\xe9 throughout the night. Very good pizza and great happy hour menu!', u\"I came here last night with my dad and we ordered 3 crostinis for $11. We got the mushroom with blue cheese, the eggplant, and the prosciutto with cheese and fig jam. The prosciutto was by far the best. Next time I would only get that one. The other two were just ok.\\n\\nWe also got the watermelon salad which was delicious! I would definitely get that again. \\n\\nThen we split the Sicilian pizza which came with pineapple, jalape\\xf1os, some kind of meat kind of like soppresatta but I can't remember the name of it, cheese, and tomato sauce. It was really good! I loved how the pizza was kind of doughy, not crunchy, and not too thin. That's my favorite kind of pizza. I didn't like the burnt parts but I guess that is what happens with that kind of pizza. Now, there was not enough pineapple on the pizza! There was only like 1-2 pieces on each slice and they were too big. I liked them but they were just too big and there wasn't enough. \\n\\nWe then got the bread pudding for dessert. I was really hoping there was going to be a dessert pizza with like mascarpone and strawberries or something but unfortunately no. The bread pudding was good though but too sweet.\\n\\nThe service was good and the place is nice too.\", u'Let\\'s talk PIZZA! So, after a failed attempt at trying one of the best pizza spots in NY ( Di Faras) I stumbled unto this little jewel of a spot. They\\'re  a bit pricey but their oven brick baked pizzas are amazing! I had the Margarita pie, YES THE WHOLE PIE. Which is about the size of a medium dominos pie, but thinner crust. Most pizza that are worth anything, are dripping with grease but have you feeling satisfied and yet guilty at the the same time. But this was deliciously satisfying with out the grease and guilt especially if you\\'re \"watching\" your figure. Also if you get the chance, try their Caesar kale salad. It\\'s soooo yummy, and the dressing is definitely homemade. The kale was a little tough, I have to admit could\\'ve been massaged more (for tenderizing) but it was totally worth the extra chews, with fresh croutons! Not the out bag sh-t. Lol  I\\'ll be back parkside.', u'Went here with a friend to catch up. Boy, is this place charming! We ordered crostini and arugula salad. My favorite crostini was the one with prosciutto, sweet and salty. Not too fond of the eggplant. I plan to return to have some pizza. The jazz really created a great vibes. It does get noisy because everyone is trying to scream of the music but the musicians are really good. So go to enjoy the jazz! Coming back!', u\"My boyfriend and I wanted to grab some food before an event, and we ended up here - and I'm glad we did! \\n\\nWe came in around 5 and got seats at the bar. The bar actually had pretty comfy seats and was pretty spacious. We ordered our drinks (mine was... interesting), and they let us order food right at 5:30. The ricotta crustini was surprisingly good, and the lamb sausage pizza was even better! The pizza came out quickly, which was great because we were getting a little hangry. The 6 slices were thin and had a lot of flavor. Not to mention that aroma! \\n\\nService was pretty good as well. As I mentioned, we were pretty hungry walking in and were sad that we couldn't order food right away. At 5:30 on the dot, the bartender came over and took our orders!\", u'Listen..... I\\'m not even a pizza person and this place ROCKS!\\nIt was so good that I actually went back the very next day for dinner. Their drinks are JUST AS GOOD.\\nSo quick run down\\nCrostinis- okay.\\nBrussel Sprouts- great\\nDrinks-AMAZINGGGGG\\n\"Sopressata\" PIZZA-AMAZINGGGGG\\nTheir happy hour is pretty cool too. Drinks are 8$. The decor of the restaurant is super cute with the lights. I feel like I\\'m in South Italy somewhere. The Bartenders and servers are pretty rad and attentive. Dessert is a must, definitely go for the cinnamon bread pudding. Thank me later:)', u\"The Ruby (vodka sauce, mozzarella, and pancetta) is so delicious, it makes me want to weep. I was here last week and it was a little different though--the pieces of pancetta were much bigger and not as crispy and rendered as it usually is, but whatever. Hope that was a fluke.\\n\\nFor white pies, I rotate between the Lamb Sausage (mozzarella, crispy onion, mint), the Mushroom (buffalo mozzarella, ricotta, porcini salt), and the Duck Confit (roasted peaches, mozzarella, honey, parm). If you want fruit on your pizza, go with the Duck Confit instead of the pineapple one that people keep complaining about on here. Pineapple on pizza is, and always will be, an abomination.\\n\\nI looked up what Cynar was and bought a weirdly huge bottle of it so I can try to replicate the amazing Allan Quatermain at home, but it's sooo much easier just to go back to Parkside with the perfect ambiance. While my apartment also boasts industrial touches, fairy lights, and Edison bulbs, it doesn't have that perfectly charred pizza crust smell permeating the air.\", u'This is the best place to get Brussels sprouts in the neighborhood. The pizza is amazing, along with their salads. Really great environment and always a good list of beers on tap.', u\"I love the calm ambiance! I've visited this establishment multiple times (i.e. To grab a drink, eat dinner, etc.). Regardless of the day and time I come, the customer service is always on point. Their pizza is to die for. They also have a Jazz band on Tuesday's.\", u\"After looking at the photos posted for Parkside, I am very sad that I haven't dined here as yet. I stopped in on my way to Smorgasburg in Prospect Park last Sunday because I wanted to use their restroom to avoid using a Port-A-Potty in the park. The interior was very low-key, quaint and gave off a nice vibe. For their kindness, I decided to buy two shots of Jameson to show my appreciation. (I also live in the neighborhood, so this was long overdue.) The bartender, Chris, was very cool and generous.\\n\\nI'll definitely be back to dine because the photos of the pizza are saliva-activating. Hopefully, Chris is at the bar, too!\", u\"The place not only looks nice but has great pizza as well. My friend and I were on our way to Zurilee but it was closed until 4pm  so we ended up finding Parkside as an alternative. I'm so glad that we did! I want to come back and try more on the menu. I had the Ruby pie and my friend had the Pepperoni (which is the best I have ever had). She had garlic knots and I had their mushroom crossonti  which was so good! Need to try some cocktails next we had beers.\", u\"I love this place!!! Is perfect. Brick oven pizzas and amazing drinks. The price is also great. Try the sopressata pizza or the mushroom (no more than usd17 and they are big for t2 hungry people) also the garlic knots!!! I don't have anything wrong to say from this place.\", u'It\\'s extremely sad to say this... because I actually love this place. But I order to go and they give me so much less salad everytime. This time they didn\\'t even have the to go boxes, put them in containers and when I looked at it and asked for more because they weren\\'t even half full I was told \"I don\\'t know what goes on in the kitchen sorry\". I am actually appalled and extremely disappointed because this WAS a great place.  I have included two pictures in that section also because the pizza was half the size and the crustinis were so small. Paying the same price for a lot  less. We are loyal customers too (literally order at least once a week) and when I said something there was \"nothing they could do\"...? Ok.', u\"Awesome wood oven pizza. \\nPepperoni pizza is amazing, and cocktails at the bar are good and strong. You came for the pizza and Parkside delivers\\n\\nJust a note. Parkside pizzas are more personal size pizzas so don't expect to come starving and get a pizza that will offer some left overs.\"], u'170.Yemen Cafe': [u'BEST LAMB IN TOWN, EXCELLENT CHICKEN TOO.\\nThe food is really tasty, the service is nice, excellent.\\nBest value for money.\\nI recommend, they deliver too !', u\"I had a fabolous experience here.   My first time having Yemenese cuisine and it left me craving more!\\n\\nI had the Lamb Haneeth, it was perfect. \\n\\nReminded me of my mom's birria!\\n\\nThank you Yemen Cafe!\", u'Yemen Caf\\xe9 in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn is the perfect spot to indulge in a Yemeni feast.  Not only is it easy accessible by public transit, it is open seven days a week from morning to late night. The Yemeni food here is indeed tasty.  Starting with the famous Marag Soup is a no-brainer. A salad often follows this.  For the main course I had the national dish which is a vegetable Salta (served bubbling hot in a pot) and accompanied by Khubz oven-baked flat bread.  Chicken haneez goes so well with a Salta whether you mix it in or eat it separately like Yemenis do.  Of course I had to have the spicy Yemeni sahawiq sauce which I used with everything.\\n\\nService was totally pleasant from the moment I walked in.  Go hungry to Yemen Caf\\xe9 ... but def go!', u\"Really delicious.  Funny enough, the main reason we came (lamb haneez) was probably the least memorable dish.  The foul was outrageously delicious - piping hot, the edges getting blackened - if you've ever made refried beans it creates something similar to the ring of slightly dried and crusty beans around the pot.  But these weren't dried and crusty, just crisp and delicious.  The soup they bring you to start was also fantastic.  I have to try the fatah next time, that looked great.\", u\"Modest ordinary sitting place with great tasty food !!!\\nI've been eating at the place for years and they always kept the same taste and the same quality, and I hope it will stay forever\", u'Awesome food , and unbelievable hospitality, and above all the price is extremely reasonable , have been there twice already in two days, \\n\\nLamb meat lovers (not me) would have a decent menu options to select from . The style mostly home cooked food such as stews and rice pilaf and mild but salty flavors.', u\"I went to eat here before a going to see a movie. The food and the service was absolutely amazing. Had I known that the portions were so ENORMOUS I would have come here after my movie because I would have loved to take my leftovers home. The prices are extremely fair due to the great taste and large portions. The pita is massive. My friend and I barely finished a whole pita. The menu is large, everything on that menu seems delicious and most of all authentic. You can tell this place is popular amongst the Arab community because it was packed for lunch. Even during such a busy lunch hour,  the service was prompt. The lamb is tender and full of flavor. I like that they use basmati rice. I'll def be frequenting this place.\", u'We were looking for a good dining experience near the Court Street Movie theater and Middle Eastern cuisine sounded enticing. This was my first time trying Yemeni food but it won\\'t be my last. The place was packed - always a good sign - yet we only had to wait a couple minutes to be seated. Middle Eastern culture is informal so we were just told to sit at \"table 9\" once it was cleared. \\n\\nAfter ordering my wife and I both were promptly served a seasoned soup that was unassumingly green like split pea soup but much better in texture and taste. \\n\\nNext was a salad with a Yemeni-style house dressing that was really good. The delicious warm flat bread came next followed by the main course. \\nI ordered the fahsah (lamb stew in a clay pot) which came out bubbling hot. It was our favorite. This stew was the perfect comfort food on a frigid winter day. \\n\\nMy wife ordered (#30) a stewed chicken dish with a hearty sauce and basmati rice. It was also well-seasoned without being too spicy or strong. \\n\\nAnd the price, $15 per person was a good bargain for the food we received. We plan to be back. Highly recommended!', u\"Ummm yum. You walk in and it smells so good if you are hungry it makes it so much worse. I love middle eastern food and I'm so happy to find a new place! \\n\\nThey serve you a broth and salad when you sit down which right off the bat is simple and very yummy. I also had the hummus with the fava bean dip on top of it. It was sooo good. I put it on the salad. Highly recommend. I'll be back for sure!\", u\"Wandered into this middle eastern family restaurant around 6pm on a Saturday after reading the great reviews.  I was very hesitant until I stepped in and noticed that the crowd was mostly middle eastern.  We were lucky to be seated right away, but 15 minutes later there was a line.  \\n\\nWhen you sit down, a large falafel like bread about 14 inches in diameter, salad, and lentil based soup is brought out to you before you order.  I asked the waiter for his recommendation and told him it was our first time here.  Without hesitation he said number 19, the lamb, slowed cooked for 5 hours with a side of rice.  The dish is for one person but with one baba ganoush appetizer it was enough for two along with the presets.\\n\\nOne of the best baba ganoush I've had in my life and I've had many.  The lamb was very flavorful, moist, and fell apart with the touch of the fork.\\n\\nI would definitely stop in again if I was in the area and craving middle eastern cuisine.\", u\":( I'm so sad my time here was disappointing. Service was fine. But man. I split the lamb haneeth for dinner, already knowing it was that much more expensive for dinner (22$ versus 16$ at lunch). Based on photos here and what I've heard, the entrees are large enough to split. However we got the most measly piece of lamb. Barely a serving and half of it was fat. The vegetable over the rice was the smaller DOLLOP ever. Like as if someone had accidentally spilled some on, not like it was meant for the dish. So essentially we were left with a huge amount of rice and barely any meat or sauce. I will say the lamb so super tender but how disappointing. I don't know if it's because we weren't Yemenite(although being North African, all the food and flavors are familiar to me) but that's what made it that much more disappointing. I know there's supposed to be more sauce and even more lamb. The soup that came with it was very familiar tasting, but also really salty. Bread was great. On the fence about if I'll return. I can eat the same food at home so\", u\"huge portions, friendly service, the openness to having guests linger after a meal even on a busy night, and incredible food and drink all make eating at Yemen Cafe a huge pleasure!!!!\\n\\nI would definitely go back. \\n\\nWe got:\\n--foul ($9.95): sauteed onions, tomatoes, mashed fava beans served hot in a cast iron cauldron-like thing and eaten with tasty warm bread from the oven -- great start to the meal\\n--chicken glaba ($15.95): minced chicken saut\\xe9ed with potatoes and other vegetables in a curry sauce, served with rice -- not too spicy, just delicious \\n--fatah with honey ($8.00): halva-like bread minced up with honey, served with cream (DO IT!) for a small fee -- so yum\\n--chicken stew (can't remember the specific name, and the online menu isn't exactly like the one we used in person), but it was super tasty and served with rice \\n--roasted half chicken with vegetable stew on the side -- my friend who ordered this ate it up so quickly \\n\\nThe small salads and soup that they gave us as extras for our meal were great, too! Honestly, we could have been fine with just the foul, two entrees, and the fatah. We had so many leftovers! The food was all great as leftovers, though..\", u\"Middle Eastern restaurants are not that common in Manhattan, but I spotted a few of them in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn near Court Street. Yemen Cafe features the eponymous Yemeni cuisine. The country sits south of Saudi Arabia between Africa and the Indian subcontinent. Thus, Yemeni food would be expectedly cosmopolitan and differ from Levantine cuisine and its Mediterranean influences.\\n\\nAs soon as I arrived, the waiter served not just a glass of water but a bowl of soup. Marag (or marageh) is a lamb soup. Don't let its pale green color fool you. It's really good. It's also served hot, which I recommend letting it cool first. Immediately after ordering, the waiter gave me a giant bread that resembled naan. But it was the size of one's face! The bread was not awfully chewy and tasted good when I dipped parts of it into the sauce mixture that came along.\\n\\nI ordered the chicken zorbian, which reminded me a little of the chicken and rice platters that have become a staple at halal carts. But this is the real deal. The chicken wasn't dry and was cubed. According to the menu, it's curried chicken made with tomatoes and onions. They also used basmati rice, spring onions, parsley, and onion. The rice was colored red, presumably from the preparation, seeing that it was mixed thoroughly with the chicken. \\n\\nPrices for lamb are steeper than those for chicken. Every lamb entree is $21.49 compared to chicken, which was set back at $15.95. There is a huge discrepancy of the prices if you come during lunch. You'd pay $12.95 for lamb dishes and $11.95 for chicken. \\n\\nService was really quick and my food came in within 20 minutes of ordering.\", u\"In the comfort of our car, we were looking for a place out of the ordinary, something different. That's when we came across the Yemen Cafe. \\n\\nWe walked inside and were seated pretty quickly despite how crowded the restaurant was and especially since we were a hungry table of 5. \\n\\nFood came really fast and the waiters kept giving us plates of bread after bread after bread. BEST DAY EVER! Bread was popping out fresh and warm out of the oven! \\n\\nI chose to get the lamb but it was a little dry. (The bread made up for it.) Overall, the food was pretty awesome! It was fun trying something new! Will be back!\", u\"Been a long while since I've ate here. Use to grab the occasional lunch here when I worked in the neighborhood. Was always a platter of various meats I preferred that day over rice. Was delicious but nothing extra noteworthy. This time around, came for dinner and tried something new. \\n\\nOrdered the saltah and lamb. Apparently saltah is the national dish of Yemen. Nice thick stew consisting of various spices, potato, eggs, and different veggies. Served piping hot and I really can't emphasize the thickness of the stew enough (when it cools, it solidifies). Dip the unlimited flat bread into it. Really really delicious. Definitely missed out on this the previous times I came. Don't make the same mistake I did. \\n\\nLamb was stewed forever. Extremely flavorful and the meat just sheds off. Friendly service and quick. Only thing I would change is bringing my own hot sauce next time. Provided hot sauce is not even remotely spicy\", u'Having never tried yemeni food before, I was excited to find this place and see where my tastebuds would take me. \\nUpon entrance you can already tell its a super authentic and feels very homely. You are served lamb soup and salad complimentary which is always great.\\nThey have a big variety of dishes, but very few vegetarian options. I went with a vegetarian and she had the only vegetarian dish and found it really worth it.\\nI had a chicken salta dish which was really really good. The chicken was cooked to perfection and very flavorful. It also comes with the biggest and best naan like bread. The quantity is enough for two or even three people for one dish.\\nI was craving it the next day, which meant it was definitely worth it.', u\"2 options: fahsa or haneeth. Don't even bother looking at the rest of the menu, this is what everyone comes here for! My husband and I have been coming here for ages. We take everyone who visits us in Brooklyn here for dinner and they're always blown away. Food is always consistent. Expect a long wait time if you come here for dinner on a weekend. Service is ok but you come to places like these for quality of food, not service. Come here if you're looking for a hearty meal, you won't be disappointed! Bay ridge location is pretty solid as well.\", u\"I love this place and have been coming for over 2 years. You know this place is legit because the clientele seem to be mostly Yemenis and people from other Arab countries. Yemeni food is unlike any food you've had - it most reminds me of some combination of Middle Eastern, Ethiopian, and Indian. \\n\\nAll their dishes come with a tasty soup, a salad, and unlimited homemade bread. They are most famous for their haneeth, which is a delish slow roasted lamb with rice. However, my go-to dish is the glaba which is minced lamb saut\\xe9ed with onions and tomatoes and flavored with a combination of spices that are out of this world. The loubia stew will knock your socks off.\\n\\nFor drinks, they do offer Hawaiian Punch but this is a Yemeni restaurant so you should get the Special Yemen Tea. It is located in a self-serve thermos in the back. I was a fool and poured the tea into one of the metal cups. Those are for water. Use the styrofoam cups for the tea and your experience will be much more pleasant.\\n\\nThere is a secret dessert hiding out in the appetizer section called Fatah with Honey. Get this. It is a divine combo of soft sliced Yemeni bread, honey, and black seeds. Make sure you get it with cream.\", u\"I read about it in the New Yorker a few months back and Yemen Cafe has been swimming on the edge of my mind since. It did not disappoint. First, the lamb soup they give you at the start is delightfully gamey and spiced and I wish more places did a free bowl of soup with every meal as a palate cleanser. Second, get the foul appetizer. Foul is a pretty common dish across much of the world, and the Yemeni version is smooth and comes in a molcajete (I'm sure they have a different term for it).\\n\\nMy friend and I split two entrees. The lamb shank was excellent, but this other lamb stew, made of tiny cubes of lamb was forgettable. Prices are kinda high ($20) a plate but the portions are large enough that any plate could be two meals.\", u'So I was in Brooklyn with fam that just came from overseas and we were hungry. Had this place bookmarked and glad we picked this place. It is self seating and after we sat down we were given complimentary naan type bread, some dip that was spicy n yum and also some kinda soup. We ordered shakshooka, Hummus and lamb w rice. Everything was super sized portions n tasted yummmmmmy!! The lamb and rice was insanely bomb n their rice was possibly the best rice ever. The hummus n shaksooka were also really good. We also got an order of the Yemeni tea which was also very good. The service was super friendly and prices very reasonable for the quantity of food. Got to experience a diff part of the middle east through their food and thoroughly enjoyed it.'], u'47.Habana Outpost': [u\"Good vibes here. Bright colors and fun decor big outdoor space. Cash only. Great for a tasty casual bite to eat!\\n\\nQuesadillas are great. Burritos, tacos great as well. Highly recommend their corn, covered with white cheese .... super tasty one of my favorite things on the menu. Big outdoor space with picnic tables great for a casual bite but indoor seating as well. You order inside and go outside where the kitchen is in a shipping container and pick up your order. \\n\\nSolar panels on the roof and recycled water in the bathroom, sustainability vibes here. They screen movies outdoors on Sundays.\\n\\nIf your going to get a drink go with a beer or one of the frozen drinks. The vodka lemonade wasn't that great.\", u\"Habana Outpost is this tiny corner of urban oasis, with delicious, affordable eats, booze, outdoor seating, giant umbrellas, and music. It is an obvious choice for summer evenings and is popular with stroller mom dates during the day. They are seasonal, so in the colder months, go across the street to Habana to Go (https://www.yelp.com/biz/habana-to-go-brooklyn?osq=Restaurants) which is the same food and people, but with seats only for 12.\\n\\nOrder inside, food comes out of the truck in the back patio. You can also sit inside, but where's the fun in that?\\n\\nI am a fan of the tortas more than anything else. The cuban sandwich is the crowd pleaser. I love the eggs and chorizo torta and make them add avocado. The elote mexican corn is also a crowd favorite. I've also gotten the steak burrito and its solid. The frozen margarita is super popular here.\\n\\nService is okay. It takes a while to have your food made and the system to call you could be better.\", u\"I'm a big fan of this place!\\n\\nIt's not exactly the healthiest of food, but if you're willing to let go once in a while and have a cheat meal, this place and its food is a perfect fit. The place is definitely distinct. In fact, it actually stands out from the rest of the neighborhood, to the point of us wondering whether or not we're still in Brooklyn. Okay, maybe not that extreme, but it is very charming and chill.\\n\\nIt's cash only payment with pickup in the courtyard, from a permanent looking food truck facade. Just be sure to keep your receipt, as your number is lit up and you need to hand it in. When I picked up our order, I felt like a little kid looking up to reach the counter and the tray. I bet you that there was at least one person who had mishandled the tray and have had it fall, but hopefully not on their face!\\n\\nThe steak burrito and cuban sandwich we ordered didn't look like much, but chowing down brought flavortown to our taste buds. I dislike pickles alone, but felt that the cuban sandwich could've used more. The steak burrito was satisfying and the steak wasn't tough, but nicely flavored and tender. We had beer as it was $5, but the frozen margaritas were close to $10, which is a bit pricey for me.\\n\\nWe'll definitely come here again and get the Mexican corn, which is super tasty.\", u\"I can't believe I've lived in Brooklyn for like 6 years but never been here even though one time my husband peed next to Adrian Grenier here and if that's not a ringing endorsement of an establishment, what is? \\n\\nThe back patio is the cuuutest. It's like a summer fairytale out there with tons of communal seating and fun rainbow umbrellas. \\n\\nAND! They have killlllllerrrrr margs. Like, how am I so drunk I only had one drink, that's not possible?! But it is, because these margs are strong. \\n\\nI know the corn is THE THING you order here, but I ordered the burger instead. It was a mistake. I added cheese and bacon (also a mistake). Don't eat the burger. They shouldn't even have a burger. Stick with the Cuban or tacos or THE CORN. \\n\\nCash only :( But there is an ATM :)\", u\"Are you a twenty-something New Yorker trying to pull a group dinner together but everything's always so damn expensive and at least one friend is always running late and also everyone lives in dramatically disparate neighborhoods?\\n\\nBreathe easy and come to Habana. It's an easygoing outdoor space where friends can come and go. Grab a table and send friends on expeditions inside to get tacos and frozen margaritas while you listen to live-DJed tasteful reggae and watch a true cross section of Brooklyn come together.\\n\\nI came with a group of friends around 7 pm on a Friday and we were lucky to get a table. As the sun goes down, they take down the rainbow umbrellas and turn on the Christmas lights. A really fun space, and convenient located right off the C in Fort Greene.\\n\\nThe line inside for food is egregiously long, though there is a separate line for drinks. Offerings include tacos, cuban sandwiches, burritos, and the star of the show, grilled corn. It's pretty cheap-- my taco was under $4 and my corn was around the same. Margaritas are only $9. Cash only!\\n\\nDespite our large order, it came out in about 10 minutes. The taco was far too soupy-- the sauce was falling out everywhere-- but the guac tasted super fresh. The grilled corn is best-in-class. Just the right amount of chili powder, mayo, and cheese to complement it. And you're even eating a vegetable! My friends enjoyed their burritos and Cuban sandwiches; I think the tacos may be their only low point.\\n\\nThe food's not bad, but the space alone makes this worth a visit. There's an abundance of good vibes and being able to sit outside with all of your pals on a warm Brooklyn night is invaluable.\", u\"WOW to the CORN!!! is it corn season? because the corn was nice and meaty and super sweet. I ordered the Cuban sandwich that was good as well, just needed some green sauce but we ordered take out/didn't know that it didn't come with. \\nMy friend order the chicken rice bowl. Not worth it, super small and not filling. Anyways will definitely come back for the corn or Cuban if I'm in the neighborhood.\", u\"All is good with this place if you ask me. I visited twice before but held out for a 3rd time before reviewing. \\n\\nGot to Outpost about 6:30 on  weeknight and well it's finally summer in NYC. It was the week leading up to the 4th so people I assume a lot of people had off. The place was full but not overflowing and the crowding moved so you could still find a seat. \\n\\nWe ordered immediately. We both had shrimp tacos and corn. I had a frozen mojito. The mojito totally got to me because I gulped it down before the tacos came. \\n\\n\\nEverything was way delicious. I couldn't make my way through 1  much less two because the cor is also filling. \\n\\nAmbience and vibes are def on ten. Quality and freshness if the food, def 10. Crowd can be a bit loud so it's possible you're eithe screaming with them or just not hearing your company. Def not ideal for a 1st date but I'd say stop by on the 4th. \\n\\nI will be back several times before summer is over.\", u\"I love this spot! I used to go all the time when I lived in the neighborhood. I stopped by again with my fianc\\xe9 after years and it's still just as amazing just a totally different demographic. \\n\\nThe Cuban, corn, and catfish were all delicious. The sangria was ahhhhmazing, but don't let it sit too long bc it tastes way too strong after a while. \\n\\nThe decor is fun and welcoming and a real community vibe. Totally worth a visit!\", u\"CASH ONLY !\\n\\nWith that said... \\nHoly... this place is absolutely gorgeous. A++ for aesthetics!! As many of you know, NYC doesn't have many outdoor eateries so this is definitely a MUST GO-TO. I can't believe how much this area has changed over the past few years.\\nThe interior is very spacious and has a very Cubano vibe. There's a backyard area with a food truck and eating area (picnic tables and umbrellas for shade..winning!). I love the concept of the restaurant, almost everything promotes an eco-friendly environment. \\nI asked for a chicken plato and frozen margarita but i'm not sure how..... I got a chicken taco (??). I should've known she messed up the order though because I was only charged $13.50. \\nFrozen Margarita- $10\\nTacos- $3 each\\n\\nThe margarita... sttttttrrrrrong (not too strong but omg, it does the job)!\\nThe tacos were tasty however I felt as though the chicken was a bit dry and so was the tortilla. . I will be returning to try the Plato I actually wanted!  \\n\\nAlmost everyone around me was eating the corn on the cob so I will be trying that next time!\\n\\nOverall, fairly priced for the area... ProTip:\\n1) Order your food/drink at the counter inside\\n2) Grab a table outside\\n3) Get your food from the truck (when your number is shown inside)\\n3) Sit and enjoy the very limited warm weather we have here in NYC!\\n\\nP.S: They have movie night every Sunday in the backyard area and they also offer events for kids (arts and crafts,etc). Also, the bathroom is just sooo cuteeeeee..... seee for yourself plz!\", u\"It's a great outdoor and indoor place to chill , and chat with friends . \\nEvery Sunday they have movie night at 8pm which is pretty dope . The only thing is they don't take cards it's cash only !\", u\"The Habana outpost is an interesting place. I believe they are only open for the summer and parts of the fall. They have a few fun outdoor activities in the summer, including screening of movies. \\n\\nI'd describe them as an indoor food truck. They have a menu consisting primarily of sandwiches. They have beers, pina coladas and some non alcoholic beverages.\\n\\nI've been here a couple of times and haven't been disappointed with their sandwiches. \\n\\nIt is a cash only place, they do have an ATM in the location. They have outdoor and indoor seating. It's a self service location, you place your order and wait for your number to be called to go pick it up.\\n\\nA nice place to grab a sandwich in a pinch, I'd probably stop by again sometime.\", u\"Always was a fan of this place. Glad it was near my university so if a few of us wanted to go somewhere to unwind, this was the best place if the season is right. Unfortunately and logical it closes temporary for the winter. My recent complaints could be why is so ridiculous crowded now. Plus I run into people now more than 1 occasion now. Sometimes you don't want that especially if you're trying to unwind after a log hectic day . Again a great place to do so. You should head over there before it cold outside. My favorite is the drinks and the corn. That's why you go anyway for the good company, drinks and atmosphere.\", u'This place is JAMMING!! Fortunately for us, we walked in at the right time because as soon as we got our food, the line of people waiting to order was literally out the door. The vibe is super chill, especially outside where the food is cooked and served through a food truck window that is definitely the focal point of the awesome yard with plenty of picnic tables to sit at. The food is good, although not the best \"Mexican\" or \"Cuban\" I have had; however the atmosphere makes up for it. The beer is cold and the people who frequent here are fun......and so does the gigantic mural of Commandate Biggie outside on the wall of the Love Building. Only drawback is you have to pay with cash which is a little annoying. I mean, who carries cash nowadays? I will say that the grilled chicken in the quesadilla was really good and the jicama, mango, and cranberry salad was fresh and flavorful. It could use more than one tiny container of dressing though. The chips and guacamole were standard but good. If in the area again, I would go back. Thankful for my friend who always has cash!', u\"Fair warning - It gets crowded quickly after 5pm\\n\\nThat being said the food and drinks here are amazing. The prices on their frozen drinks aren't too harsh, and the wait was never long. Definitely worth a night if you're in the area or on a date. Cuban food done right should always be appreciated.\", u\"Wow. What an awesome little cuban oasis in the middle of Fort Greene in Brooklyn. I popped into Habana with a few friends on Saturday afternoon for their delicious cubanos and, naturally, some margaritas. Staff was not overly nice or outgoing or supportive, but did everything you could want.\\n\\nAtmosphere outside is amazing, and I love the interior of the restaurant, including the bathrooms that are all rain-water powered. The restaurant itself seems to be at least partially powered by solar energy as they have a ton of solar panels around the outside, which I will always support. \\n\\nThe cubano was one of the best that I have ever had. It was moist, full of flavors, had a little spice to it, and the meats were all clearly of quality. I was really really impressed by how every bit just made me want to come back for more. If I had one complaint about the sandwich it would be that it was a bit small for the $9 price tag. The margarita was good, but not great, and cost $9.75 for a 10-oz frozen margarita with very little tequila. I wish it were a little larger, had a little bit more alcohol in it, and had salt as an option. I don't mind spending the money on a drink, especially in NY, but I was disappointed in this for basically $10.\\n\\nI would definitely come back, but I probably would have a few drinks before or just only be expecting to have one drink. \\n\\nALSO, it is CASH ONLY and the ATM inside did not work that day I was there.\", u\"So first things first... CASH ONLY! Next thing you need to know is that after you place your order, you have to go outside to the truck to get your food. There is indoor and outdoor seating available. I had the guacamole and queso plate which was delicious, but it took almost thirty minutes to receive... mainly because girl taking orders is very unpleasant and did not notify myself or the other people behind us how it worked. So we sat inside and waited all that time until I got up and asked. That's why I had to take off a star. Food was great. Would come back again now that I know better.\", u\"Habana Outpost is a Brooklyn staple that was a go to place for me a few years back but I've slowed down on going as more people became fans and it became impossible to find seats in the summer. LOVE the outdoor, bench seating for summer time food and drinks with friends. It's a small space and can become very packed but when you do find a seat, it's worth the wait. I love the Mexican corn and the chicken burrito, those are easily my 2 go-to items. The drinks are ok, not as strong as I prefer but you can't have Mexican without a margarita. \\n\\nThey now have opened a takeout spot across the street which I tried out 2 days ago. I ordered my usual chicken burrito which has rice and beans, peppers, and lettuce and tomatoes inside. I do wish it came with some type of sauce to make it less dry. I asked for sour cream for it and was told that they would have to charge me $1.25 for it. What?! My boyfriend had a shrimp, chicken and fish taco. I loved the shrimp taco which had a chipotle mayo on it. I recommend visiting Habana at least once in the summer to eat outside and enjoy the ambience. But then, stick to takeout so you can still enjoy the food without the crowd.\", u'We used to come here more often when my boyfriend lived in Fort Greene but we still try to come every now and again even if we\\'re not quite as close anymore!\\n\\nMy go-to when I\\'m here is the fish tacos and the elote. The elote. Please get the elote. My boyfriend has gotten some of the other tacos, too, all of which were delicious. So far, everything we\\'ve tried has been delicious. Also, they\\'re super consistent.\\n\\nThey have margaritas on the rocks and blended on \"tap\" do to speak. The margs taste great and refreshing. My boyfriend also tried the blended mojito but we both preferred the margarita. Their lemonade is also yummy.\\n\\nNote: this place is usually paaaaacked. They have outdoor seating and it can get pretty loud out there. The last couple of times, we sat indoors (towards the back) and it was a lot cooler and less crowded, so we could actually chat (and hear each other). \\n\\nIt seems like a lot of people like to come here to hang out and have drinks. The place definitely has a festive atmosphere.\\n\\nAnyway, we love it here and will definitely keep on going!', u\"Hidden Gem in Brooklyn... Very convenient for travelers taking to subway. Located right across the street from the Fulton subway platform. This place is very small so if you come during the rush you may not get a place to sit as they have literally 1 table and very small counter space. We lucked up to sit at the one table they had which only fits four people. I ordered the ground beef empanada and the steak quesadilla. The empanada was fresh and wrapped in a flaky dough and fried to perfection. The quesadilla is drizzled with sour cream and some type of green sauce which complimented the cheese and steak. They don't have a bar but they do offer adult daiquiris. I had a Mandarin bottled soda with my meal. I enjoyed the close atmosphere in this tiny dive. \\nPS if you're a fan of Biggie Smalls check out the mural painted on the outside if the building\", u\"Habana Outpost can be a fun place.  I enjoyed my cuban sandwich yesterday - the pork was very juicy and the chewy roll sopped it up nicely.  The frozen daquiri also hit the spot on a sunny day - oddly, when I ordered it,  the cashier asked if it was to go (we're not in NOLA!)   \\n\\nHowever, I am deducting a star because this place is CASH ONLY...and their ATM has a $2 surcharge.  This area of Fort Greene is a bank desert and I find it offensive for this place to be cash only.   Too Greedy.\"]}\n"
